Introduction Phosphorene with its semiconducting nature is a newly included member in the family of two dimensional (2D) materials and is a potential candidate for nano- and opto-electronic applications due to its exceptional properties such as strong structural anisotropy, high mechanical strength, large lateral flexibility and high conductivity.1,2 Black phosphorene (a-P) exhibits a puckered structure,3 whereas blue phosphorene (b-P) possesses a graphene-like honeycomb structure of phos- phorous atoms.4 Both a- and b-P are semiconductors with a band gap of B1 eV and B2 eV, respectively.4,5 Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are another family of 2D materials6 with tunable electronic and dielectric properties.7\u20139 The mono- layers of TMDs are triatomic, in which
