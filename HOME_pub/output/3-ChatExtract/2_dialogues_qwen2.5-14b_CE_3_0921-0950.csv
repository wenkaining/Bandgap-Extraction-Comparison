Note that the phonon scattering channels are similar for GeSe, SnS and SnSe, while that for GeS is different due to the lack of the scat- tering channels of LA/TA/FA+A/O1→O2, which is resulted from the large gap (2.014THz) between O1 and O2 for mono- layer GeS."

The deviation from linearity in the experimen- tal data at low rh is due to Urbach tail regions, i.e., defect states near the band edge, which are common to amorphous structures as in this work.9 In PECVD samples (Fig. 5), there is a deviation from linearity at high rh due to a partial crys- talline transition in less than 30% of the QDs after annealing at 800 C.8 When the ﬁt was constrained to the linear region, a less than 1% difference was found in our ﬁnal ﬁtting pa- rameters compared to ﬁtting over the entire data set."

Revealing the Exciton Fine Structure of PbSe Nanocrystal Quantum Dots Using Optical Spectroscopy in High Magnetic Fields R. D. Schaller,1 S. A. Crooker,2 D. A. Bussian,1 J. M. Pietryga,1 J. Joo,1 and V. I. Klimov1 1Chemistry Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA 2National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA (Received 7 April 2010; published 4 August 2010) We measure the photoluminescence lifetime  of excitons in colloidal PbSe nanocrystals (NCs) at low temperatures to 270 mK and in high magnetic ﬁelds to 15 T. For all NCs,  increases sharply below 10 K but saturates by 500 mK. In contrast to the usual picture of well-separated ‘‘bright’’ and ‘‘dark’’ exciton states (found, e.g., in CdSe NCs), these dynamics ﬁt remarkably well to a system having two exciton states with comparable—but small—oscillator strengths that are separated by only 300–900 eV depending on NC size."

In the common case of CdSe NCs these properties combine to split the 1S band-edge exciton into the now well-established ﬁne structure of ﬁve distinct levels, wherein the lowest-energy state is an opti- cally forbidden ‘‘dark’’ exciton that lies as much as  ¼ 2–15 meV below the nearest optically allowed ‘‘bright’’ exciton."

In contrast with wide-gap semiconductors like CdSe (which have wurtzite or zinc blende structure and direct band gaps at the Brillouin zone center  point), lead-salt semiconductors such as PbSe are narrow-gap materials having rocksalt crystal structure and direct gaps at the fourfold degenerate L point at the Brillouin zone edge."

As such, exciton ﬁne structure in lead-salt NCs is expected to be rather different, and several theoretical studies have been reported for PbSe NCs: Four- band envelope wave function methods ﬁrst suggested 1–5 meV exchange energies and predicted an optically allowed exciton ground state [11], whereas tight-binding calculations anticipated that the nominally degenerate L points are split in NCs by tens of meV by intervalley coupling [12]."

Here we measure PL and PL decay times  in infrared- emitting rocksalt PbSe NCs at temperatures over 5 times lower than previously reported (to 270 mK), and also in high magnetic ﬁelds to 15 T. We ﬁnd that  increases sharply below 10 K, but saturates below 500 mK. In marked contrast to the ‘‘conventional’’ exciton ﬁne struc- ture found in CdSe and other wide-gap NCs (i.e., clear dark and bright exciton levels with orders-of-magnitude dif- ferent oscillator strengths, well separated in energy by 2–15 meV), the dynamics in PbSe NCs ﬁt remarkably well to a distinct exciton structure containing two weakly emitting states with comparable oscillator strength, that are split by a surprisingly small energy of only 290–870 eV (r ¼ 2:3–1:3 nm)."

A similar corre- spondence—namely, that I increases by approximately the same factor as —is observed for all NC ﬁlms upon cooling to 50 K.

Although double per- ovskites have a 3D crystal structure, in some cases, the [B′X6]5−octahedra do not contribute to the density of states at the band-edges and result in 0D electronic dimensionality [71], which may lead to large indirect band gaps and hinder carrier transport."

In the MnAs ﬁlm/III–V/MnAs ﬁlm magnetic tunneling junc- tions MTJs reported before, due to the poor crystal quality of the semiconductor layer, the tunneling process through the defect band appeared.23 Furthermore, the high density of the defects at the III–V/MnAs interface in those junctions pinned the Fermi level of the electrode at the midgap of the semiconductor; thus, the barrier height is as high as 0.7 eV. Consequently, any attempt to inject spin-polarized carriers to the conduction band will result in no spin-valve signal since the bias voltage needed for the Fowler-Nordheim FN tun- neling of electrons to the conduction band of the semicon- ductor layer becomes much larger than Vhalf."

C. Fully pseudo-spin-polarized FM phases Given the spin-z components associated with the induced IRREPs of the EBR at  and M (Table I), we anticipate that by increasing ϵZ there must be a second transition into a phase with fully pseudo-spin-polarized valence (conduction) bands (right column of Fig. 4), i.e., the ↑(↓) band has a ↑- (↓-) spin component at  and M."

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4979859] I. INTRODUCTION Piezoelectric materials have gained importance in terms of reversibly transferring strain to other materials, especially semiconductors, for the purpose of tuning the electrical and optical properties.1,2 The magnitude of strain induced in this way is directly proportional to the electric ﬁeld applied across the piezoelectric material, making use of the converse piezoelectric effect.3 In the past several years, devices using this approach have been extensively studied to tune the optical emission spectra of direct band-gap semiconductors.2,4–10 The design of these devi- ces has become more and more reﬁned, which ﬁnally allows the choice of the preferred orientation of the transferred strain.8,9,11 The techniques used to bond the semiconductor on the piezoelectric substrate are mostly gold-thermo-compression or bonding mediated by a comparatively “soft” polymer."

In pure RS-ZnO, the prominent peaks are at 12.4 and 16 eV. When we replace Zn by Mg in the RS-ZnO crystal, the positions of the peaks shift toward higher energy values until all the Zn atoms are replaced by Mg and it is noted that (for RS-MgO) the prominent peaks are at 14.2, 16.4 and 19.9 eV. It is further noted that the maximum peak in RS-ZnO is at 16.06 eV, while in RS-MgO it occurs at 19.87 eV.
