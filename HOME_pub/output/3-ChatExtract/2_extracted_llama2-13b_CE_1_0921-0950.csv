"Numerical integration was conducted  via a simple trapezium rule for each reﬂection across a peak width  of 0.2 ˚A. As the (01 ¯4 ) α and (116) α reﬂections lie in close proximity  to the { 011 } γ ’ and { 012 } γ ’ reﬂections, a contribution of their sig- nals was included in the numerical integration. As it was known  that there was no γ ′ present at t = 0 (see APT results later) and  no separate superlattice reﬂection contribution could be detected,  the intensity associated with the alumina could be subtracted.","As it was known  that there was no γ ′ present at t = 0 (see APT results later) and  no separate superlattice reﬂection contribution could be detected,  the intensity associated with the alumina could be subtracted.",59/10.1016/j.actamat.2020.09.055,"

"We note that this relation, i.e., the estimation of a temperature- independent DOS, is valid as long as anharmonic effects in the vibrations within an IS are not too strong.31,64 Strictly speaking, the DOS should be rather interpreted as an effective DOS because each state is also weighted by the harmonic partition function, i.e., by the inverse square root of the frequency.31 It is known that the DOS distribution of a binary Lennard-Jones liquid or BKS-silica has a Gaussian shape over a large energy range.64–66 To determine G(EIS) over a broad energy range, based on the Boltzmann distributions from different temperatures, one could try to overlap the different G(EIS)-curves, obtained from different temperatures. A procedure to obtain the DOS in a statistically opti- mized way is the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM).67 To obtain the DOS G(EIS), we use the algorithm developed by Gallicchio et al.,68 which reads for the present application G(E IS) = ∑iN(E IS, Ti) ∑iNi(Ti)fi(Ti)ci(E IS, Ti).","A procedure to obtain the DOS in a statistically opti- mized way is the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM).67 To obtain the DOS G(EIS), we use the algorithm developed by Gallicchio et al.,68 which reads for the present application G(E IS) = ∑iN(E IS, Ti) ∑iNi(Ti)fi(Ti)ci(E IS, Ti).",116/10.1063/5.0118797,"

"Based on such observations, recently, there has been considerable progress in the understand- ing of track formation induced by elec- tronic excitation.[7] Concerning the effects of materials parameters (MPs) , it has been shown that track formation is controlled only by the melting temperature Tm in a broad range of ion energies.[7] Besides practical aspects, this is of high theoretical interest, as Tm is an equilibrium parameter; nevertheless, it controls a process under spike conditions.

"We note that our measurements cannot distinguish between purely metallic, A15 β-W, and A15 W oxide or nitride (e.g., W3O); the identity of β-W as a purely metallic phase or a compound is a longstanding controversy.12,13 In ferromagnet (FM)/normal metal (NM) heterostructures, pure (chargeless) spin currents can be injected from the FM into the NM by exciting ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in the FM layer, “pumping” out the spin current.14,15 If the spin current is absorbed in the NM layer, the inﬂuence of “spin pumping” can be observed through the increase in the linewidth of the resonance, proportional to frequency ω as Gilbert damping, due to the loss of angular momentum from the precessing spin system.14,15 The eﬃciency of the spin pumping eﬀect for a given interface is charac- terized through the spin mixing conductance (SMC) g""# FM=NM.

"While graphene can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Ge and noble metal surfaces (e.g., Cu, Ag, and Pt), the high synthesis temperatures and catalytic reactions at the surface currently preclude growth directly on technologically important compound semiconductor substrates such as GaAs and InP. The use of non-native substrates necessitates postsynthesis large-area graphene layer transfer and annealing, which can damage the graphene by introducing contaminants such as oxides and polymer residues and creating tears, wrinkles, and point defects on the larger length scales relevant to device applications.9 Previous studies have explored the qualitative impacts of defects on graphene diﬀusion barriers.2,10,11 However, the speciﬁc eﬀect of the layer transfer process, elevated temperatures during growth, and a quantiﬁcation of the diﬀusivity through graphene has not yet been reported.

In radia- tion detectors, the wide band gap of PIMs results in low dark current, which is important for them to achieve a high signal-to- noise ratio, with a low lowest detectable dose rate, down to 0.6 nGyairs−1 in MA3Bi2I9.","In radia- tion detectors, the wide band gap of PIMs results in low dark current, which is important for them to achieve a high signal-to- noise ratio, with a low lowest detectable dose rate, down to 0.6 nGyairs−1 in MA3Bi2I9.",123/10.1088/1361-6528/abcf6d,"

"Furthermore, the composition of PIMs of high atomic number elements allows these materials to have high stopping power for radiation, which in turn results in sensitivities to X-rays being comparable to MAPbBr3 and orders of magnitude larger than conventional Si, a-Se and CZT materials. The high resistivities of PIMs owing to their wide band gap is also advantageous for achieving a high resistance ‘off’ state in memristors, and on/off ratios comparable to or larger than conventional oxide-based materials have been reported.","The high resistivities of PIMs owing to their wide band gap is also advantageous for achieving a high resistance ‘off’ state in memristors, and on/off ratios comparable to or larger than conventional oxide-based materials have been reported.",123/10.1088/1361-6528/abcf6d,"

"In the MnAs ﬁlm/III–V/MnAs ﬁlm magnetic tunneling junc- tions MTJs reported before, due to the poor crystal quality of the semiconductor layer, the tunneling process through the defect band appeared.23 Furthermore, the high density of the defects at the III–V/MnAs interface in those junctions pinned the Fermi level of the electrode at the midgap of the semiconductor; thus, the barrier height is as high as 0.7 eV. Consequently, any attempt to inject spin-polarized carriers to the conduction band will result in no spin-valve signal since the bias voltage needed for the Fowler-Nordheim FN tun- neling of electrons to the conduction band of the semicon- ductor layer becomes much larger than Vhalf. The unique GaAs:MnAs electrode in our spin-valve structure, however, allows the overgrowth of a high-quality and atomically con- trolled GaAs semiconductor spacer layer.19–21 Furthermore, the MnAs nanoparticles have been shown to work well as a spin injector and a spin detector.21 The barrier height be- tween MnAs and GaAs in our spin-valve structure was found to be very small, allowing direct spin injection to the con- duction band of GaAs by FN tunneling with a relatively small bias voltage.","The unique GaAs:MnAs electrode in our spin-valve structure, however, allows the overgrowth of a high-quality and atomically con- trolled GaAs semiconductor spacer layer.19–21 Furthermore, the MnAs nanoparticles have been shown to work well as a spin injector and a spin detector.21 The barrier height be- tween MnAs and GaAs in our spin-valve structure was found to be very small, allowing direct spin injection to the con- duction band of GaAs by FN tunneling with a relatively small bias voltage.",152/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.214435,"

"In a broader vision, ME effects include not only the coupling between the electric and magnetic polarizations, but also related phenomena such as an electrically con- trolled exchange bias [10,11] and magnetocrystalline an- isotropy [12–14], and the effect of ferroelectricity on spin transport [15–19]. Two mechanisms for the ME effect have been estab- lished: (1) in single-phase ME materials (including multi- ferroics) an external electric ﬁeld displaces ions from equilibrium positions which changes the magnetostatic and exchange interactions affecting the magnetization [20]; (2) in composite multiferroic materials, piezoelectric strain in the ferroelectric constituent of the multiferroic heterostructure induces changes in the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic constituent due to magnetostriction [9,13,14].","Two mechanisms for the ME effect have been estab- lished: (1) in single-phase ME materials (including multi- ferroics) an external electric ﬁeld displaces ions from equilibrium positions which changes the magnetostatic and exchange interactions affecting the magnetization [20]; (2) in composite multiferroic materials, piezoelectric strain in the ferroelectric constituent of the multiferroic heterostructure induces changes in the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic constituent due to magnetostriction [9,13,14].",175/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.137201,"

By following this argument one may imply that the electronic structure of OV(0) may be similar to NV(−) and it might be useful as a qubit but with enhanced T1 time of the electron spin when the natural abundant 16O is involved in the defect with no nuclear spin; or rather 17O isotope is engineered in the OV defect with I = 5/2 nuclear spin for enhanced number of quantum states for qubit operations. In this context it is important to note that one ESR center in CVD diamond samples was proposed to originate from OV(0) defect but no spin polarization could be detected in this ESR center upon photoexcitation [7].,In this context it is important to note that one ESR center in CVD diamond samples was proposed to originate from OV(0) defect but no spin polarization could be detected in this ESR center upon photoexcitation [7].,24/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.125202,"

Moreover, band structure calculations performed for the A8Ga16Ge30 series (with A = Ba, Sr, and Eu) show a strong hybridization between the unoccupied guest ion d states and the antibonding framework states.58–61 Both Eu8Ga16Ge30 and Sr8Ga16Ge30 clathrates were reported to have similar band gap energy, although smaller when compared to the Ba8Ga16Ge30 compound.58 The difference in the band gap is directly related to the ionic radii in which the larger element donates more effectively the electrons to the cages.60 The higher band gap energy for the Ba clathrate can also explain the higher amorphization pressure due to changes in the stability between the sp3 bonding orbitals and the antibonding.","Moreover, band structure calculations performed for the A8Ga16Ge30 series (with A = Ba, Sr, and Eu) show a strong hybridization between the unoccupied guest ion d states and the antibonding framework states.58–61 Both Eu8Ga16Ge30 and Sr8Ga16Ge30 clathrates were reported to have similar band gap energy, although smaller when compared to the Ba8Ga16Ge30 compound.58 The difference in the band gap is directly related to the ionic radii in which the larger element donates more effectively the electrons to the cages.60 The higher band gap energy for the Ba clathrate can also explain the higher amorphization pressure due to changes in the stability between the sp3 bonding orbitals and the antibonding.",23/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.144105,"

"Maintaining a constant flow rate in the presence of a fluctuating flow pressure is essential for many lab-on-a-chip devices in areas such as drug delivery, flow chemistry, and micro-dialysis, among others.66 Flow regulators perform this task by adjusting the hydraulic resistance of a microfluidic system Rh in harmony with the upstream flow pressure Δp such that the flow rate Q remains unchanged according to Δp/Q = Rh. To achieve this principle, active-mode regulators utilize externally applied pressure signal to increase (decrease) Rh when Δp increases (decreases).","To achieve this principle, active-mode regulators utilize externally applied pressure signal to increase (decrease) Rh when Δp increases (decreases).",38/10.1039/D3LC00529A,"

"First, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the substitution of Cr ions on the Bi site typically leads to a local distortion and a geometric symmetry breaking in the surround- ing ions, due to the large lattice mismatch, and such distortion can be suppressed by forming the aggregation structure [see Fig. 7(b)]. Second, the 3d bands of the Cr atoms are not sufﬁciently localized and are considered to be more active, so these atoms have a tendency to bind together via the interaction between the 3d bands, which can lower the total energy of the system.","Second, the 3d bands of the Cr atoms are not sufﬁciently localized and are considered to be more active, so these atoms have a tendency to bind together via the interaction between the 3d bands, which can lower the total energy of the system.",163/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.054113,"

"KEYWORDS: layered perovskites, (BA)(MA)PbI, spin dynamics, photocarrier dynamics, time-resolved spectroscopy T he perovskite CaTiO3 was discovered in 1839 by Gustav Rose, fortuitously starting a debate lasting over a hundred years about the general crystal structure of perovskites.1,2 Since then, perovskites have been a topic of intense research for a multitude of features, from high- temperature superconductivity,3−5 giant magnetoresistance,6 and oxide fuel cells7 to efficient solar cells.8,9 Especially, they have been shown to host exceptionally high quantum efficiency in terms of their optoelectronic performance.10−12 This combined with the presence of spin−orbit interaction, particuarly strong in lead halide based perovskites, and a resulting broken spin degeneracy makes them highly appealing for spin-optoelectronic devices.13−16 However, an indisputable challenge to their application is the (photo)degradation of perovskites resulting in a notably short device lifetime.17 In recent years, layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have emerged as a viable alternative, as several groups have reported an increase in lifetime of 2D perovskite devices.18−20 Being two-dimensional by design, it is relatively straightforward to exploit quantum confinement effects to tune their band gap by adjustment of the layer number, making them perfectly suited for multijunction devices.21 In that way the efficiency limit of a single junction can be overcome .22,23 One example of such a layered perovskite is butylamonium methylamonium lead iodide, (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1. Its band gap can be tailored from 1.5 to 2.3 eV by reducing the layer number from bulk to a stack of single layers, thereby covering almost the whole visible spectral range.17,23,24 Given their recent emergence, funda- mental properties of the layered perovskite materials have not been fully explored, particularly in the direction of their spin and carrier dynamics,25 vital aspects to be explored for practical applications.","Its band gap can be tailored from 1.5 to 2.3 eV by reducing the layer number from bulk to a stack of single layers, thereby covering almost the whole visible spectral range.17,23,24 Given their recent emergence, funda- mental properties of the layered perovskite materials have not been fully explored, particularly in the direction of their spin and carrier dynamics,25 vital aspects to be explored for practical applications.",86/10.1021/acsnano.3c09001,"

INTRODUCTION The entanglement among charge, spin, orbital, and struc- tural degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides leads to a great number of emergent phenomena, one remarkable ex- ample of which is the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of two insulating compounds, e.g., SrTiO3/LaAlO3 [1,2], SrTiO3/γ -Al2O3 [3,4], SrTiO3/RTiO3 (R = La, Gd, Nd) [5–8], SrTiO3/LaVO3 [9], SrTiO3/LaGaO3 [10], and SrTiO3/DyScO3 [11]. Quantum many-body effects at the interfaces of transition metal oxides stimulate the for- mation of two-dimensional polar metals, magnetic 2DEGs, and the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism [12–17].","Quantum many-body effects at the interfaces of transition metal oxides stimulate the for- mation of two-dimensional polar metals, magnetic 2DEGs, and the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism [12–17].",189/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.104008,"

The broadening increases linearly with the excited state energy with respect to the Fermi level, and is weakly dependent on temperature.","The broadening increases linearly with the excited state energy with respect to the Fermi level, and is weakly dependent on temperature.",30/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.117701,"

"[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4979859] I. INTRODUCTION Piezoelectric materials have gained importance in terms of reversibly transferring strain to other materials, especially semiconductors, for the purpose of tuning the electrical and optical properties.1,2 The magnitude of strain induced in this way is directly proportional to the electric ﬁeld applied across the piezoelectric material, making use of the converse piezoelectric effect.3 In the past several years, devices using this approach have been extensively studied to tune the optical emission spectra of direct band-gap semiconductors.2,4–10 The design of these devi- ces has become more and more reﬁned, which ﬁnally allows the choice of the preferred orientation of the transferred strain.8,9,11 The techniques used to bond the semiconductor on the piezoelectric substrate are mostly gold-thermo-compression or bonding mediated by a comparatively “soft” polymer. One of the major issues for an efﬁcient strain transfer between the piezoelectric substrate and the semiconductor membrane seems to be the stiffness of the bonding interlayer which is mainly determined by the material’s Young’s modu- lus.",One of the major issues for an efﬁcient strain transfer between the piezoelectric substrate and the semiconductor membrane seems to be the stiffness of the bonding interlayer which is mainly determined by the material’s Young’s modu- lus.,16/10.1063/1.4979859,"
