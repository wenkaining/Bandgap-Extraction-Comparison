85/236,"Therefore,  the multicolored appearance of the large domes in Figure¬† 2a  can be ascribed to Newton‚Äôs rings caused by the interference of  the light reflected inside the H2-filled spherical volume.[28] As noted earlier and shown in Figure¬†1f, the average PL peak  energy of the domes is about 200 meV lower than that of the  corresponding material in the ML form (see also Figure S7 in  the Supporting Information).","The  shape of the domes itself‚Äîi.e., their height-to-radius ratio‚Äî results from the interplay between: (i) the vdW forces that tend  to keep the TMD layers together, thus minimizing the dome  radius; (ii) the stiffness of the top TMD layer, which limits the  dome height; and (iii) the tendency to expand of the trapped  gas, which results in the application of a constant pressure  on the dome‚Äôs walls.[6] We estimate such pressure to be about  10 atm for R ‚â≥ 500¬†nm, given the average T HLV¬†= 32.2 K and  the H2 phase diagram (see Note S1 and Ref.
