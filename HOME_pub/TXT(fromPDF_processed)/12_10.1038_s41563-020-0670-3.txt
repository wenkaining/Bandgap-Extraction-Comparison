✉e-mail: libai-huang@purdue.edu V an  der Waals (vdW) heterostructures assembled from  graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal  dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as a new class of  materials in exploring new quantum phenomena with designed  functionalities1–5.
Spatially indirect interlayer excitons can be  formed with electrons and holes localized in different TMDC   layers6–9, with much longer lifetimes than those of direct intra- layer excitons, which achieves long-range exciton- and valley-spin  transport3,4.
Further, lattice mismatch or rotational misalignment  in the semiconducting TMDC heterostructures leads to the forma- tion of moiré potentials (nanoscale periodic energy potentials for   excitons), which provides a configurable solid-state excitonic   analogue to ultracold atoms in optical lattices or photons in pho- tonic crystals10,11.
Scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements  and density functional theory (DFT) simulations for MoS2–WSe2  (refs. 10,12,13) suggested amplitudes of the moiré potentials as large  as hundreds of millielectronvolts.
More recently, far-field optical  measurements indicated the existence of moiré excitons in semi- conducting TMDC heterostructures by observations, such as trap  exciton emission, flat exciton bands, spatially varying valley polar- ization and resonantly hybridized excitons14–19.
Although the photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectros- copy measurements from the aforementioned studies14–19 provided  indirect evidences for localized excitons, how excitons migrate  from one location to another in the energy landscape modulated  by moiré patterns remains largely unknown.
Specifically, the local- ization of excitons by potentials as large as 200 meV is seemingly  at odds with the long-range interlayer exciton diffusion over a  length scale of micrometres in TMDC heterostructures at both low   temperature and room temperature3,20,21.
The transport of spatially  indirect excitons has been extensively investigated in electrically  biased coupled quantum wells, which demonstrates long-range  transport and quantum many-body effects22–24, although moiré pat- terns do not exist in these systems.
In addition, so far the studies  on interlayer exciton dynamics have assumed solely K–K excitons;  however, recent works showed that interband K–Q transition could  be the ground state25,26 and should play a crucial role in dynamics.
Here, we report exciton population imaging in the WS2–WSe2 het- erobilayers with two different twist angles (0 and 60°) with a tem- poral resolution of ~200 fs and a spatial precision of ~50 nm.
These  measurements directly address the role of moiré potentials in exci- ton transport and provide evidence for the K–Q interlayer excitons.
Moiré superlattice in WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers We performed measurements on the WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers,  prepared using a modified two-step chemical vapour deposition  (CVD) method (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1) that provides  contamination‐free and atomically sharp interfaces27.
Figure 1a  shows an optical image of two typical WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers,  grown on a Si wafer with an oxide of thickness 285 nm.
The larger  bottom layer is a single-layer WS2 (1L-WS2), whereas the smaller top  layers are single-layer WSe2 (1L-WSe2).
The presence of the verti- cal heterostructures constituted of WS2 and WSe2 monolayers was  confirmed using Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The  heterobilayers have two stacking orientations with twist angles of 0  and 60°, which are energetically favourable in the CVD growth27.
We confirmed the stacking orientation using second harmonic  generation spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The moiré pat- terns can be directly observed by high-resolution annular dark-field  (ADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images  (Fig. 1b for 60° and Extended Data Fig. 1 for 0° and a large-scale  STEM image of 60°).
The lattice mismatch of the monolay- ers of the WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers is about 4% (Supplementary   Fig. 4), which leads to a moiré periodicity of ~7.6 nm.
The moiré  Twist-angle-dependent interlayer exciton  diffusion in WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers Long Yuan   1, Biyuan Zheng2, Jens Kunstmann3, Thomas Brumme4, Agnieszka Beata Kuc   5,6,  Chao Ma   2, Shibin Deng   1, Daria Blach1, Anlian Pan2 and Libai Huang   1 ✉ The nanoscale periodic potentials introduced by moiré patterns in semiconducting van  der Waals heterostructures have  emerged as a platform for designing exciton superlattices.
However, our understanding of the motion of excitons in moiré  potentials is still limited.
Here we investigated interlayer exciton dynamics and transport in WS2– WSe2 heterobilayers in time,  space and momentum domains using transient absorption microscopy combined with first-principles calculations.
We found  that the exciton motion is modulated by twist-angle-dependent moiré potentials around 100 meV and deviates from normal  diffusion due to the interplay between the moiré potentials and strong exciton–exciton interactions.
Our experimental results  verified the theoretical prediction of energetically favourable K–Q interlayer excitons and showed exciton-population dynamics  that are controlled by the twist-angle-dependent energy difference between the K–Q and K–K excitons.
These results form a  basis to investigate exciton and spin transport in van der Waals heterostructures, with implications for the design of quantum  communication devices.
Nature Materials | www.nature.com/naturematerialsArticles Nature Materials supercells are shown in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b; high- lighted in colour are different local, high-symmetry stacking con- figurations, labelled according to the nomenclature introduced in  Yu et al.13, in which Hh h; HM h ; HX h I  and Rh h; RM h ; Rx h I  correspond to the  atomic registries of 2H (hexagonal) and 3R (rhombohedral) bulk  polytypes, respectively.
The WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers have a type II band alignment28,29,  which results in the formation of spatially indirect interlayer exci- tons, with electrons and holes that reside in the WS2 and WSe2 lay- ers, respectively (Fig. 1d).
As shown in Fig. 1e, the PL spectra at  78 K display a new emission peak at ~1.45 eV in the WS2–WSe2 het- erobilayers with twist angles of 0 and 60°, which is attributed to the   emission from the interlayer excitons16.
The PL microscopy image  (Fig. 1f) shows that the interlayer emission is uniform over the  entire heterostructure region, which confirms spatial homogeneity  over the micrometre length scale.
First-principles calculations To gain insights on how the energy landscape for the interlayer exci- tons is modified by the moiré pattern of the 0 and 60° heterobilayers,  we performed first-principles calculations using DFT (see Methods  and Supplementary Note 1 for details).
We calculated the energy of  the four lowest-energy optical transitions between the valence-band  maximum in the K valley and the conduction-band minimum in  the K and the Q valleys (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1) for  different stacking configurations.
Notably, the lowest-energy tran- sition is always K–Q and, therefore, K–Q interlayer excitons are  expected to represent the ground state.
The moiré potentials plotted  along the main diagonal of the moiré supercells, shown in Fig. 2b   (also see Supplementary Table 2), indicate that the spatial varia- tions for 0° are much stronger (deep potential) than those for 60°  (shallow potential).
The moiré potentials are expected to modulate  the transport of interlayer excitons, because the excitons encounter  twist-angle-dependent energy barriers as they move from one loca- tion to another, as illustrated in Figs. 2c,d for the K–K excitons.
The  grey area in Fig. 2b indicates the spatial variation of the energy dif- ference between the K–Q and the K–K transitions, ΔEK–Q. Averaged  over the whole moiré pattern, the mean difference ΔEK–Q is larger  for 0° than for 60° (88 meV versus 62 meV; Supplementary Table 3).
Therefore, the population dynamics of the K–K and K–Q excitons  should also be affected by the twist-angle-dependent ΔEK–Q. Exciton-transport imaging The twist-angle-dependent moiré potentials calculated by DFT  suggest the interlayer excitons in the 60° heterobilayers are more  mobile.
To verify this prediction, we employed transient absorp- tion microscopy (TAM; more details in Supplementary Note  2 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6)30,31 to image the spatial– temporal-dependent exciton population and experimentally extract  the average potential, encountered as excitons migrate.
We used a  linearly polarized pump beam at 1.58 eV to create excitons in WSe2  and a probe energy of 1.95 eV was used to track the electron pop- ulation in the K (or K′) valley of WS2 after the formation of the  K–K interlayer excitons (Fig. 3a).
Figure 3b shows that transient  absorption (TA) signal is spatially homogeneous for both 0 and  60° heterobilayers on the same WS2 underlayer (images for other  heterobilayers studied are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7).

Nature Materials | www.nature.com/naturematerialsArticles Nature Materials to the broader WS2 A exciton peak (Supplementary Fig. 8), probably  because of a faster charge transfer32.
The time-dependent exciton population profiles measured by  TAM are shown in Fig. 3c for 60° and Supplementary Fig. 9 for 0°.
These population profiles were obtained by scanning the pump– probe distance x.
At zero delay time, the excitons were created by  a pump beam of ~500 nm that resulted in a Gaussian distribution  with variance σ2 0 I , n x; 0 ð Þ ¼ N0expð x2 2σ2 0Þ I .
A unity conversion from  intralayer excitons in WSe2 to interlayer excitons was assumed and  the exciton density at time zero N0 ranged between 2.1 × 1012 and  6.0 × 1012 cm–2 (Supplementary Note 3).
The exciton migration led  to a broader Gaussian distribution of n x; t ð Þ ¼ Ntexpð x2 2σ2 tÞ I  at a  later delay time t and σ2 t  σ2 0 I  corresponds to the mean squared dis- tance travelled by the excitons.
Normal diffusion driven purely by  population gradient would lead to a linear temporal dependence of  σ2 t  σ2 0 I  (Supplementary Note 2), which was observed for intralayer  excitons in the 1L-WS2 and 1L-WSe2 (Fig. 3d).
Deviating from a normal diffusion behaviour, anomalous dif- fusion of interlayer excitons was observed for both the 0 and 60°  heterobilayers with a non-linear temporal dependence of σ2 t  σ2 0 I   (Fig. 3d).
The interlayer excitons also migrate faster at higher den- sities (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10),  which could be explained by the net repulsive Coulomb interac- tion between the interlayer excitons due to electron–hole separa- tion and the aligned electric dipole moments3,21,33 (Supplementary  Note 4 and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).
We also carried out  exciton-density-dependent PL measurements (Extended Data Fig. 3),   which showed the interlayer exciton emission blueshifts as density  increases and confirmed the repulsive exciton interaction8,21,34.
In  contrast, the Coulomb forces cancelled each other out when averag- ing the interactions among many excitons with randomly orientated  dipoles in the monolayers (Supplementary Fig. 12) and negligible  density dependence was observed for the intralayer exciton diffu- sion (Extended Data Fig. 4).
The speed of interlayer exciton migra- tion was substantially faster than those of intralayer excitons in  1L-WS2, 1L-WSe2, 2L-WS2 and 2L-WSe2 (Fig. 3d and Supplementary  Fig. 13), which demonstrates the central role of repulsive exciton  interaction.
Exciton–exciton annihilation could lead to apparent  increase in exciton diffusion35; however, we ruled out this effect as  exciton dynamics showed no density dependence under our experi- mental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 5).
The twist-angle dependence of the interlayer exciton transport  strongly suggests the role of the moiré potentials.
Consistent with  the prediction from DFT calculations (Fig. 2b), excitons were less  mobile in 0° than in 60° at the same exciton density (Fig. 3d).
This  difference is unlikely to be due to defect density, because these two  heterobilayers were grown on the same WS2 layer (Fig. 3b) and  under the exact same conditions.
Further, we confirmed (Extended  Data Fig. 6) that the twist-angle dependence was reproducible in  all six of the heterobilayers measured and the variations in exciton  migration for the different heterobilayers with the same twist angle  were within experimental error.
We also ruled out mechanisms  such as Seebeck effect and phonon-assisted hopping36 in enhancing  exciton migration because these mechanisms would not depend on   the twist angle.
The effect of moiré potentials on exciton transport  is further supported by temperature-dependent measurements   1 2 3 1 2 3 M K Γ Q WSe2 WS2 ∆EK–Q 1 2 3 4 Rh h RX h RM h Rh h 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 V (eV) Hh h HM h HX h Hh h 1 2 4 3 4 1 3 2 a b c V (eV) Energy d 0.20 0.10 0.0 Fig. 2 | Moiré potentials in WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers calculated with DFT.

The theoretical results show  that the moiré pattern leads to a twist-angle-dependent modulation of the energy landscape that governs the interlayer exciton transport.
Nature Materials | www.nature.com/naturematerialsArticles Nature Materials (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 2), which show a reduced speed  of exciton migration as the temperature decreases.
In contrast, the  intralayer exciton transport in the 1L-WS2 showed the opposite tem- perature dependence (Extended Data Fig. 4), with a faster motion at  78 K than at 295 K, attributed to reduced phonon scattering.
Modelling of exciton transport To quantitatively describe the motion of interlayer excitons in the  moiré potentials, we employed a thermionic model developed for  quantum wells with a fluctuating energy landscape as described in  Ivanov et al.37: ∂n x; t ð Þ ∂t ¼ ∇Jdiff þ Jdrift ð Þ  n x; t ð Þ τ ð1Þ where τ is the exciton lifetime, Jdiff describes the normal exciton  diffusion, which can be written as Jdiff ¼ D∇nðx; tÞ I , where D is  the diffusion coefficient, Jdrift denotes the drift flux due to repul- sive interaction between the interlayer excitons, which is given by  Jdrift ¼ nðx; tÞμu0∇nðx; tÞ I , where μ is the exciton mobility and u0  is the exciton interaction energy per unity of density.
u0 comes from  the Coulomb scattering between two excitons and is the sum of  the direct interaction energy (dipole–dipole udd) and the exchange  interaction energy (uexch) (refs.
3,10,38), as illustrated in Supplementary  Fig. 11 and described in Supplementary Note 4. udd (ref. 3) and uexch  (ref. 38) can be approximated by dzE1sR1s and 2:07E1sR2 1s I , respectively,  where dz is the interlayer separation (~0.7 nm), E1s is the exciton  binding energy and R1s is the exciton Bohr radius for the ground 1s  interlayer exciton state.
Owing to the small interlayer distance, the  exchange interaction is significantly larger than the dipole–dipole  interaction, uexch udd ¼ 2:07R1s dz ¼ 6:8 I .
We adopted the values of 0.126 eV  (ref. 39) and 2.3 nm (ref. 38) for E1s and R1s, respectively, which led to  a u0 of 1.6 × 10–14 eV cm–2.
The exciton interaction energy calculated  here agrees well with the magnitude of the PL blueshift in Extended  Data Fig. 3.
When the density increases, more excitons occupy higher-energy  states due to the repulsive interaction, and they may migrate as if  the potentials were lowered.
As temperature increases, the in-plane  kinetic energy for the excitons increases and the potentials are also  effectively screened.
Thus, the effective diffusion constant D can be  related to the trapping potential U and can be as D0exp½ U kBTþu0nðx;tÞ I ,  where D0 is the exciton diffusion constant in the absence of the trap- ping potential (U = 0) (ref. 37), where kB is the Boltzmann constant  and T is the temperature.
However, the exciton mobility is given  by the Einstein relation μ ¼ D kBT I  and, therefore, the drift flux Jdrift is  enhanced relative to diffusion at low temperature.
Therefore, the depth of moiré potentials can be determined by  modelling the exciton-density- and temperature-dependent TAM  results.
As shown in Fig. 3d–f and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 6, solid  lines represent the fitted σ2 t  σ2 0 I  based on equation (1) with the  same set of parameters (three free parameters are U (0°), U (60°) and  D0).
After averaging from all the samples measured (Supplementary  Tables 4 and 5), a moiré potential of U = 0.124 ± 0.003 eV was  obtained for the 60° heterobilayers and a deeper potential   of U = 0.159 ± 0.005 eV was determined for the 0° heterobilayers.

Nature Materials | www.nature.com/naturematerialsArticles Nature Materials The trapping potentials extracted from the TAM experiments rep- resent the averaged potentials experienced by the interlayer K–K  excitons, because the pump beam size of ~500 nm is much larger  than the moiré periodicity of ~7.6 nm.
The measured potential  values agree well with the averaged potential heights of 0.08 and  0.17 eV for 60 and 0°, respectively, predicted by our DFT calcula- tions (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2).
D0 of 5.4 ± 0.6 cm2 s–1  at room temperature represents the diffusion constant of the free  interlayer excitons if there were no moiré potentials.
We note that temperature-dependent steady-state PL micros- copy measurements have shown that interlayer excitons travel  longer distances at lower temperatures20,21,33.
Yet, steady-state mea- surements integrate over the entire exciton lifetime and the lon- ger lifetimes at lower temperatures can compensate for the slower  exciton migration, and thus lead to an overall larger distance trav- elled.

Nature Materials | www.nature.com/naturematerialsArticles Nature Materials distances at 150 and 78 K than at room temperature, the substan- tially increased PL lifetimes at 4 and 20 K result in an overall larger  distance travelled than at room temperature.
Furthermore, because  the exciton density is proportional to the PL lifetime under con- tinuous wave excitation, the exciton density increases as the tem- perature decreases, which will also lead to faster exciton migration.
Taken both effects into account, we can reproduce qualitatively  the temperature-dependent steady-state PL results of MoSe2–WSe2  heterobilayers in Unuchek et al.20,33 and Jauregui et al.21 using our  model, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 15.
Population dynamics of K–K and K–Q excitons To probe the population dynamics of K–K and K–Q excitons, we  selectively monitored electrons and holes in the K valleys using  pump–probe TA spectroscopy, as schematically shown in Fig. 4a.
As the holes reside in the K valley of WSe2 for both the K–K and  K–Q interlayer excitons, the hole population probed at 1.60 eV  corresponds to the sum of the K–K and K–Q exciton populations  (NK–K + NK–Q).
In contrast, electrons are located in different valleys  for the K–K and K–Q interlayer excitons.
The dynamics probed at  1.95 eV reflects only the K–K interlayer exciton population (NK–K),  because only the electrons in the K valley of WS2 contribute the TA  signal.
Thus, the population dynamics of the K–K and K–Q excitons  can be elucidated by comparing the dynamics probed at 1.60 eV  with that probed at 1.95 eV. As shown in Fig. 4b, the decay time of (NK–K + NK–Q) in the het- erostructures is 970 ± 180 ps at 295 K, which is much longer than  that of the intralayer excitons in 1L-WSe2 (51 ± 6 ps), due to the  spatially indirect nature of the interlayer excitons6.
The dynamics  of (NK–K + NK–Q) do not exhibit substantial twist-angle dependence  on the nanosecond timescale (Fig. 4b for 295 K and Supplementary  Fig. 16 for 78 K).
In contrast, the NK–K dynamics probed at 1.95 eV  and 295 K (Fig. 4c) shows that the decay time for 0° is about   three times shorter than that for 60°.
The twist-angle-dependent  dynamics is reproducible in a total number of 16 samples (Extended  Data Fig. 7).
The lifetime of (NK–K + NK–Q) increases to 4.1 ± 0.9 ns   at 78 K (Fig. 4d), showing a similar temperature dependence   to that of the PL decay (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary  Note 5), probably due to the suppressed non-radiative recom- bination8.
The decay for NK–K in both the 0° (Fig. 4e) and the 60°  (Supplementary Fig. 18) heterobilayers becomes substantially  shorter at lower temperatures, the opposite to that of (NK–K + NK–Q)  shown in Fig. 4d.
The twist-angle- and temperature-dependent NK–K dynamics  can be explained by intraband scattering of the electrons between  the K and Q valleys, influenced by ΔEK–Q. Initially, the electrons  transferred from WSe2 reside in the K valley of WS2, but they  are quickly scattered to the Q valley by the intervalley scattering  through phonon emission (ΔEK–Q > 0.
However, the back scattering  of electrons from the Q to the K valley by phonon absorption is  a thermal process and the probability of this process is governed  by Bose–Einstein statistics, f E ð Þ / 1=ðe ΔEKQ kBT  1Þ I .
At higher tem- peratures, more electrons are back scattered from the Q to the K  valley and therefore NK–K increases, which leads to a longer decay  time (Fig. 4e).
The impact of temperature on the scattering from  Q to K can be seen in Fig. 4f, in which the K–K exciton decay time  increases as the temperature increases.
A higher temperature is  required for 0° than for 60° to thermally excite phonons to scatter  electrons from Q to K (Fig. 4f).
The larger ΔEK–Q for 0° leads to a  less efficient Q–K scattering and hence a shorter K–K exciton decay  time than that for 60° (Fig. 4c).
We ruled out the K–K triplet exciton  state as an alternative explanation for the temperature-dependent  dynamics.
First, as shown in Fig. 2b, the K–K triplet state is lower  in energy than the K–K singlet at 0°, but it is the opposite for 60°.
If the temperature-dependent dynamics were related to the K–K  triplet excitons, the 0 and 60° heterobilayers would exhibit the  opposite temperature dependence.
Second, the dynamics in the  control 1L-WS2 sample, with a low-lying triplet exciton state, shows  the opposite temperature dependence to that of the heterobilayers,  which displays a slower decay at 78 K compared with that at 295 K  (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Conclusion and outlook In summary, the presence of moiré potentials substantially alters the  dynamics and transport of interlayer excitons, as demonstrated by  the ultrafast exciton population imaging presented here.
Interlayer  exciton transport strongly depends on the exciton density and   the depth of moiré potential, and cannot be described by a single  diffusion coefficient or a diffusion length, as has been commonly  assumed.
At a sufficiently high density (>1013 cm–2), the effect of  moiré potentials can be totally screened.40 We have also demon- strated that K–Q interlayer excitons are the ground state, not the  K–K excitons commonly assumed to be the ground state, and it  is necessary to consider them when discussing interlayer exci- tons in the WS2–WSe2 systems.
These new physical insights could  provide a guideline for designing quantum photonics devices  using two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices and inspire  new studies on exploring novel quantum phenomenon, such as  high-temperature exciton condensation.

The vertically stacked WS2–WSe2 heterostructures were  synthesized via a modified two-step CVD method27, schematically shown in  Supplementary Fig. 1.
Briefly, a quartz boat with tungsten disulfide powder (99.8%,  Alfa Aesar) and a piece of Si wafer with a 285-nm-thick oxide (1 cm × 3 cm) were  placed at the centre and downstream, respectively, of the furnace for the growth  of the WS2 monolayers.
The system was first cleaned by a high-purity Ar gas  (400 sccm) for 15 min.
The furnace was then heated to 1,050 °C and kept at this  temperature for 10 min for the growth of the WS2 monolayers.
The as-prepared  WS2 monolayers were used as the new substrate for the vertical growth of the WSe2  monolayers.
The tungsten diselenide powder (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) and the substrate  with the WS2 monolayers were placed at the centre and downstream, respectively,  of the quartz tube.
A mixture flow of H2/Ar (with 5% H2) gas was used as the  carrier gas and the growth temperature was set at 1,000 °C.
After the growth, the  furnace was left to naturally cool down to room temperature.
There are two key advantages of heterobilayers grown by two-step CVD  compared to stacked heterobilayers from exfoliation: (1) the heterostructure areas  are homogeneous over several micrometres, in contrast to stacked bilayers with a  spatial heterogeneity such, as air-bubble formation41, which could lead to random  potentials that cofound the effects of the moiré potentials and (2) heterobilayers  with two different twist angles were grown under identical conditions and on the  same WS2 underlayer, and therefore should have a similar defect density. STEM.
For STEM measurements, CVD-grown WS2–WSe2 vertical heterostructures  were transferred onto a copper grid using a poly(methyl methacrylate)-assisted  transfer method.
The STEM measurements were carried out on a JEOL ARM200F  microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a probe-forming aberration  corrector.
For high-angle ADF-STEM images, the inner and outer collection  angles of the ADF detector were 68 and 280 mrad, respectively.
The convergence  semiangle was about 28 mrad.
Confocal PL microscopy.
PL measurements were performed by employing a  homebuilt confocal PL microscope.
A picosecond pulsed diode laser (LDH-P-C- 450B, Pico-Quant) with an excitation energy of 2.8 eV and a repetition rate of  40 MHz was used to excite the sample.
The laser beam was focused onto the  sample using a ×50 (numerical aperture (NA) = 0.95) objective.
The PL emission  was collected with the same objective, dispersed with a monochromator (Andor  Technology) and detected using a charge-coupled device (Andor Technology).
PL images were acquired using a galvanometer scanner (GVS012, Thorlabs) to  scan the excitation beam.
Time-resolved PL was measured using a single-photon  avalanche diode (PDM series, PicoQuant) and a single-photon counting module  (PicoQuant).
For temperature-dependent PL measurements, the sample was  mounted on a cold finger of a continuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat   (ST-500, Janis).
A ×40 (NA = 0.60) objective was used to focus the laser beam   onto the sample.
TA microscopy and spectroscopy.
TA dynamics and transport measurements  were taken using a homebuilt TAM system, performed in the reflection mode  (schematically shown in Supplementary Fig. 5).
Briefly, a Ti:sapphire oscillator  (Coherent Mira 900) pumped by a Verdi diode laser (Verdi V18) was used as the  fundamental light source (1.60 eV, 76 MHz and 200 fs).
Of the pulse energy, 70%  was fed into the optical parametric oscillator (Coherent Mira OPO) to generate  the probe beam at 2.00 eV, and the remaining 30% served as the pump beam.
The pump beam was modulated at 1 MHz using an acoustic optical modulator  (Model R21080-1DM, Gooch & Housego).
Both pump and probe beams were  spatially filtered.
A ×60 (NA = 0.95) objective was used to focus both the pump  and probe beams onto the sample, and the reflection light was then collected by  the same objective and detected by an avalanche Si photodiode (Hamamatsu).
The change in the probe reflection induced by the pump was detected by a lock-in  amplifier (HF2LI, Zurich Instruments).
For morphological imaging, the pump  and probe beams were spatially overlapped and a piezoelectric stage (P-527.3Cl,  Physik Instrumente) was used to scan the sample with a step size of 200 nm.
For  exciton-transport imaging, a galvanometer scanner (GVS012, Thorlabs) was used  to scan the probe beam relative to the pump beam in space to obtain the exciton  diffusion profiles.
For the TA dynamics measurements, the pump and probe beams were spatially  overlapped and a mechanical translation stage (LTS300, Thorlabs) was used  to delay the probe with respect to the pump.
For the measurements of the hole  dynamics, we used the output of a high-repetition-rate amplifier (400 kHz, Pharos  Light Conversion) to pump two independent optical parametric amplifiers, one  to provide the pump (1.80 eV) and the other to supply the probe (1.60 eV).
Both  the pump and probe beams were spatially filtered.
An acousto-optic modulator  (R23080-1, Gooch & Housego) was used to modulate the pump beam at 100 kHz.
The change in the probe reflection induced by the pump was detected by a lock-in  amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research).
For temperature-dependent exciton dynamics and diffusion measurements, the  sample was mounted on a cold finger of a continuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat  (ST-500, Janis).
A ×40 (NA = 0.60) objective was used to focus both the pump and  probe beams onto the sample. DFT calculations.
The moiré potentials were calculated by considering different  high-symmetry stacking configurations of the heterobilayers.
The configurations  were structurally optimized using DFT as implemented in the ADF-BAND  software42 (BAND2018, SCM, http://www.scm.com).
The maximum gradient  threshold for geometry optimization was set to 10−3 Hartree Å−1.
The Perdew– Burke–Ernzerhof43 exchange-correlation functional was used together with the  valence triple-zeta polarized basis sets composed of Slater-type and numerical  orbitals with a small frozen core.
Relativistic effects, such as spin–orbit coupling,  were taken into account by employing the zero order regular approximation44.
The  k-space integration was done with the 2D variant of the regular k-space grid using  the quadratic interpolation method, which resulted in nine symmetry-inequivalent  k points.
The convergence of the k-space grid was checked; a denser grid did not  substantially change the transition energies.
The vdW interactions were accounted  for using the D3 correction together with the Becke–Johnson damping function, as  proposed by Grimme et al.45.
