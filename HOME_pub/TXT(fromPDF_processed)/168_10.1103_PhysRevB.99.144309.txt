Our results underline the two-dimensional nature of MoS2.
In combination with state-of-the-art ﬁrst-principles calculations, we determine the phonon displacement patterns, symmetry properties, and scattering intensities.
The results will be the basis for future experimental and theoretical work regarding electron-phonon interactions, intervalley scattering, as well as phonons in related 2D materials.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.99.144309 I. INTRODUCTION Lattice dynamics constitute one of the most fundamental properties of a crystal, being the basis for mechanical and elas- tic properties, thermal transport as well as charge-carrier dy- namics, phonon-assisted optical excitations, and many more.
In this view, it is highly desired to have reliable data about the phonon dispersion relation of MoS2, a layered crystal that has boosted the new research ﬁeld of two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene during recent years [1–5].
This is due to its fascinating physical properties in single-layer form, which it shares with related transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) like MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, or MoTe2 [6–9].
Many of their physical processes relevant for new applica- tions [10,11], such as carrier and exciton dynamics [12–14], decay of so-called valley polarization [15–18] (the selective population of one of the two inequivalent K points in the Brillouin zone), and relaxation of spins [19,20], crucially depend on phonons.
For example, phonons with considerably large wave vector are required for optical absorption and emission from the indirect band gap in few-layer and bulk TMDCs.
They are the relevant source for electron scattering in electron transport [21] and are expected to play a signiﬁcant role in the formation of momentum-space indirect interlayer excitons in van-der-Waals heterostructures [22,23].
In MoS2 and other TMDCs, however, experimental data on the full phonon dispersion are missing.
Only one high- symmetry direction of the Brillouin zone in MoS2 has been accessed so far by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) [24].
However, the part most relevant for scattering with large phonon wave vectors q or between the inequivalent points K and K′ (i.e., between the valleys) is completely missing and has been addressed by DFT calculations only so far, e.g., in Refs. [25–27].
This is compounded by the dependence of the phonon frequencies on the employed exchange-correlation *ht07@physik.tu-berlin.de †janina.maultzsch@fau.de approximation, raising the question of the accuracy of the- oretical predictions for q ̸= 0.
The same holds for the other TMDCs, which have in common, as an obstacle for INS experiments, the in-plane nature of the phonon dispersion and the lack of large single crystals.
Here we present the entire phonon dispersion relation of MoS2 in the high-symmetry directions -K, -M, K-M, and -A of the Brillouin zone as determined by inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments.
We show the existence of almost degenerate Davydov pairs throughout the Brillouin zone, as well as nearly quadratic dispersion of the out-of- plane acoustic modes (ﬂexural modes), underlining the two- dimensional nature of MoS2.
We further present density- functional theory (DFT) calculations with implemented van- der-Waals correction and simulations of the structure factor, which determines the scattering intensities.
They are in ex- cellent agreement with the experimental data and reveal the mixing of in-plane and out-of-plane phonon displacement directions inside the Brillouin zone. II.
METHODS A. Experimental setup Our inelastic x-ray spectra were recorded at beamline 35XU at the SPring-8 (Japan).
A beam with a photon energy of 17.7935 keV with a spectral width of ≲3 meV (full width of half maximum, FWHM) was obtained by using a liquid- nitrogen cooled Si (111) high heat load premonochromator, reducing the FWHM to ≈1 eV. The ﬁnal width was created with a near-backscattering main monochromator of which the Si (999) reﬂex was used.
The beam was then focused onto the sample with a spot size of 75 × 63μm2, enabling us to select a single crystalline domain of the bulk MoS2 crystal.
The scattered photons were analyzed by an array of 3 × 4 bent Si (111) analyzers, attached to the 10 m monochromator arm.
A detailed description of the beamline can be found in Ref. [28].
The measurements were performed by keeping the scat- tering wave vector Q (and thereby the phonon wave vector 2469-9950/2019/99(14)/144309(13) 144309-1 ©2019 American Physical SocietyHANS TORNATZKY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 144309 (2019) q) constant and scan the energy by varying the temperature of the backscattering main monochromator.
The twelve an- alyzers were kept at a ﬁxed energy (i.e., temperature).
To verify that no signiﬁcant energy shifts of analyzers and main monochromator have occurred, Stokes-anti-Stokes pairs of inelastically scattered photons were measured between most of the energy scans.
The measurements were performed in reﬂection geometry for A longitudinal and all out-of-plane transverse modes and in transmission for M, K, and KM longitudinal and in-plane transverse modes.
To record signal from low-intensity modes, momentum resolution was set to 0.75 nm−1.
The sample is a synthesized crystal (HQ graphene, Nether- lands) with a thickness of about 150 μm to match the at- tenuation length of the used x rays in MoS2, yielding the best tradeoff between high absorption and low scattering in a transmission setup.
All measurements were taken in ambient conditions.
B. Computational approach We calculated the theoretical phonon band structure within the frame of density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) on the level of the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ﬂavor [29] (GGA-PBE) as imple- mented into the QUANTUM ESPRESSO suite [30].
Long-range noncovalent interactions were included through the semiem- pirical DFT-D3 correction with Becke-Johnson damping [31], ED3 = 1 2  A  B  CAB 6 s6 R6 AB + f 6 + CAB 8 s8 R8 AB + f 8  , where RAB is the distance between atom A in a central unit cell and atom B in the crystal.
We included all atoms within a cutoff distance of 100 Å from the center of the central unit cell in the sum over B. CAB n is the nth order dispersion coefﬁcient for the pair of atoms A and B. f = a1R0 AB + a2 is a damp- ing constant, with a ‘covalent distance’ R0 AB =  CAB 8 /CAB 6 [31].
Here, we used our own set of parameters (s6 = 1.0, s8 = 0.9184, a1 = 0.5484, a2 = 2.156 Å), which was ﬁtted to reproduce the experimental lattice constants of a wide variety of layered and bulk materials and had been used previ- ously [22,32,33] with great success.
The Mo(3s, 3p, 3d, 4s) and the S(3s, 3p) states were treated as valence electrons using multiprojector optimized normconserving Vanderbildt (ONCV) pseudopotentials [34,35] with a cutoff of 120 Ry.
All reciprocal space integrations were performed by a discrete q point sampling of 12 × 12 × 4 q points in the Brillouin zone.
We fully optimized the atomic positions and cell parameters until the residual forces between atoms and the cell stress were smaller than 0.001 eV/Å and 0.01 GPa, respectively.
The threshold for the total energy was set to 10−14 Ry, which ensured tightly converged interatomic forces for the geometry optimization and of the ground state density and wave functions for the DFPT calculations.
The phonon band structure was obtained through Fourier interpolation using the explicitly calculated phonon frequencies on a regular grid of 12 × 12 × 4 q points.
The contributions to the dynamical matrix from the D3 corrections were fully included in the phonon calculations. FIG.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2H-MoS2 forms a hexagonal crystal with space group P63/mmc (D4 6h in Schönﬂieß notation) with six atoms in the unit cell, giving rise to 18 phonon branches.
At the  point, the phonon modes decompose into the irreducible representations 2H = A1g ⊕2A2u ⊕2B2g ⊕B1u ⊕E1g ⊕2E1u ⊕2E2g ⊕E2u for the conventional deﬁnition of a 120◦angle between the in- plane lattice vectors [38,39].
Due to the relatively weak non- covalent coupling of the MoS2 layers, the phonon branches are nearly doubly degenerate at almost all q vectors in the Brillouin zone and correspond to the nine phonon branches of single-layer MoS2 (three atoms per unit cell, space group P¯6m2, D3h).
In Fig. 1(a), a selection of the measured IXS spectra is plot- ted.

Here, (h k l) are the Miller indices identifying the scattering vector of the elastically scattered light, i.e., a Bragg peak.
The extracted peak positions thus represent the dispersion of the out-of- plane transverse modes from  to M, see Fig. 1(b).
The IXS measurements allowed us to identify all acoustic and almost all optical phonon branches along the A--K-M- directions as shown in Fig. 2. IXS data are shown by circles together with theoretical values from DFT calculations (lines).
Phonon energies obtained by Raman spectroscopy of the same sample (stars in Fig. 2) complement the IXS results with data at the  point.
We ﬁnd seamless agreement between the - point frequencies and the IXS data.
In the experiment, we observe nine phonon branches.
The calculations show that they are almost doubly degenerate, 144309-2PHONON DISPERSION IN MoS2 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 144309 (2019) FIG.
2. Inelastic x-ray scattering measurements and density-functional perturbation theory calculations of the phonon dispersion of MoS2 along the high-symmetry directions A--K-M-. Circles in green/blue/red represent measurements probing phonons with an in-plane longitudinal (L)/in-plane transverse (T)/out-of-plane transverse (Z) component.
For symbols without an error bar, the error is estimated to be smaller than the symbol size.
Open symbols depict peaks with small intensities or larger error.
Values at the  point are Raman and IR spectroscopy data from the literature [36–38] (diamonds) and from Raman measurements on the same sample as used in the IXS experiment (stars).
Phonon branches are labeled by their symmetry within the D6h at the  point, as well as by their displacement (L, T, Z) and acoustic (A) or optical (O) character.
For a symmetry labeling at the K and M points, see Table I; for a compilation of the eigenvectors see Appendix B. as expected from the weak interlayer forces.
The energy resolution in the IXS experiment, however, does not allow us to distinguish these so-called Davydov pairs: Each pair is formed by two phonon modes, where the two layers forming the bulk unit cell (i) have both the same displacement pattern as the single layer and (ii) the displacement of one of the layers is shifted in phase by π.
At the  point, one of the bulk modes of such a pair is always even with respect to spatial inversion and the other one is odd [36,38].
The frequency difference of the two phonons in a Davydov pair is very small if the interaction between the layers is weak.
Only the acoustic phonons have fundamentally different behavior: One mode is still acoustic (zero frequency), whereas the other one has ﬁnite frequency and corresponds to a rigid-layer vibration at the  point.
Near the  point, the phonon modes have well deﬁned dis- placement direction, i.e., in-plane longitudinal (L), in-plane transverse (T), and out-of-plane transverse (Z).
This is seen by the color of the symbols representing the IXS data, which indicates the displacement direction preferentially detected in the given scattering geometry.
Towards the K and M points, we observe data points with different colors (i.e., different preferred displacement directions) on the same branch, see for instance the longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch.
We interpret this by an increased mixing of the displacement directions for increasing q. This is supported by our calculations of the phonon eigenvectors, see Fig. 3 for the example of the transverse E1g branch and Tables II–IV in Appendix B for a compilation of all 18 eigenvectors at the , K, and M points.
Note that the mixing is not limited to the in-plane direction but includes the out-of-plane modes as well, in contrast to the example of graphite [40].
This mixing also explains why some of the phonon branches are only partially observed or show weak signal: For instance, the phonon branch with E1g symmetry at the  point (in-plane vibration) cannot be ob- served in the chosen scattering geometry (see also discussion below).
However, it gains an out-of-plane component for q > 0, see Fig. 3, which results in (weak) IXS signal.
Furthermore, we observe a quadratic dispersion of the ZA branch (also called ﬂexural mode) near the  point, which is typical for FIG. 3.

two-dimensional atomically thin sheets [41] and underlines the 2D nature of the MoS2 layers even within the bulk crystal.
One challenge for lattice-dynamics simulations in layered materials is the proper description of the effect of noncova- lent interactions, which bind the individual layers together.
This is particularly relevant for the rigid-layer, low-frequency shear, and breathinglike modes in the vicinity of the  point, where the force constants are small and dominated by contributions from the noncovalent interlayer coupling.
The commonly used local density approximation (LDA) to DFT appears to offer a consistently good agreement with experimental phonon frequencies for a wide range of lay- ered and bulk crystals but largely beneﬁts from its intrin- sic overbinding, which causes a hardening of the predicted phonons at the cost of signiﬁcantly lower-quality lattice constants.
Therefore, we implemented the contributions from the popular DFT-D3 van-der-Waals corrections [31] to the dy- namical matrix [42] to the density functional perturbation theory code in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [30].
These semiempirical corrections introduce an additional attractive London-like interatomic potential, which compensates for the underbinding and intrinsic exponential decay of nonclassical interactions in the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation approx- imation [29] we used for our computations.
The obtained lattice constants of a = 3.158 Å and c = 12.229 Å from our PBE+D3 calculations are close to the lattice constants of our MoS2 sample of aexp = 3.161 Å and cexp = 12.297 Å, suggesting a convincing description of both covalent and noncovalent interatomic bonding in MoS2, in agreement with previous studies [22,32,33].
The inclusion of noncovalent interactions leads to a notice- able improvement for the values of the low-frequency modes close to the  point, which are signiﬁcantly underestimated in the GGA-PBE approximation without the D3 correction (not shown).
Our calculated phonon dispersion is in excellent quantitative agreement with the IXS measurements for the acoustic and low-energy optical modes (Table I) and correctly describes the small ‘bumps’ in the dispersion of the Davydov pair of the LA-derived branch [E2g (LO, shear mode) and E1u (LA) at the  point] along -K-M-, see Fig. 2.
We ﬁnd a small overestimation of our predicted frequen- cies of the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) mode compared to the IXS measurements.
While the deviation is within the margin of error in our measurements, we note that this mode is particularly difﬁcult to converge with the cutoff energy of the plane-wave expansion that we use in our calculations, due to the weak forces between the rigidly oscillating layers.
This situation is similar to the ZA modes in graphite and layered boron nitride.
For the higher-frequency modes, our PBE+D3 approach appears to perform slightly less well compared to the Raman measurements and the local-density approximation 144309-4PHONON DISPERSION IN MoS2 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 144309 (2019) results from Ref.
[26], and systematically underestimates the frequencies of the Raman active modes by a few cm−1, see Table I.
In general, the predictions from LDA calculations are somewhat higher than those from our PBE+D3 calculations, hence leading to a slightly better agreement between theory and the Raman and IXS measurements for the high-energy optical modes compared to PBE+D3 calculations, while the agreement for the acoustic and low-energy optical modes is worse.
The good quality predictions of the optical modes appears to be consistent for a wide range of layered crystals but is to a certain extent fortuitous due the intrinsic overbind- ing of LDA causing a hardening of the predicted phonons at the cost of signiﬁcantly lower-quality lattice constants.
The DFT-D3 method hence simultaneously offers an accurate de- scription of both vibronic and structural properties of layered MoS2 that goes beyond the capabilities of noncorrected local DFT approximations such as LDA, PBE, or PBEsol [43].
An improved quantitative agreement over the full fre- quency range of MoS2 and similar layered materials hence re- quires an exchange-correlation approximation that predicts a stronger (weaker) in-plane covalent bonding than PBE (LDA) and sufﬁciently soft interlayer noncovalent interaction.
Due to the generally attractive nature of the DFT-D3 corrections, a good description of both structural and vibronic properties would then require an exchange-correlation functional that slightly overestimates both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice constants.
An alternative to semiempirical dispersion correc- tions might be an approach based on nonlocal van-der-Waals correlation functionals from the vdW-DF [44,45] or the VV10 [46] families that are combined with the PBEsol functional or similar approximations, which are well suited for the description of lattice constants in extended systems.
While we observed the phonon dispersion of eight of the nine Davydov pairs in the experiment, we were unable to access the almost degenerate branches derived from the two LO modes around 35 meV (E2u and E1g at the  point) in the -K and -M directions in our scattering geometries.
In order to understand this, we simulated the dynamical structure factor [47,48] using data from our DFT calculations, see Appendix A for details.
The simulations suggest that destructive interference of the counterphase oscillation of the sulfur sublayers in each MoS2 layer cause extinction of the structure factor for all q vectors along the -M and -K-M directions, if a Bragg peak (h k 0) is used.
Using a Bragg peak (h k l) with a suitable out-of-plane component l ̸= 0 should lead to activation of the LO E1g and E2u branches, caused by symmetry breaking of the phase factors from the atomic positions, which lifts the destructive interference.
The intensity can be enhanced through a wise choice of the Bragg peak such that it aligns the signs of the contributions from the atomic displacements and of the phase factors from the atomic positions.
This is illustrated in Fig. 4(a) for simulated measurements at the Bragg peak (−2 4 2) in the direction (q 0 0).
Further, our simulations cor- rectly reproduce the deactivation of the transverse E2u branch and activation of the longitudinal E1g branch in the vicinity of the K point that we observed in our IXS experiments near the (0 0 12) peak, see Fig. 4(b).
This arises from a change of atomic displacement patterns of the longitudinal E2u and E1g modes from a pure in-plane to a pure out-of-plane nature (a) (h k l)=(-2 4 2) (b) (h k l)=(0 0 12) 250 300 350 400 450 Frequency (cm -1) Γ (0,0,0) (1/2,0,0) M (1/2,-1,0) M K (1/3,-2/3,0) E1g Γ (0,0,0) E2u FIG.

On the other hand, the transverse E2u and E1g modes adopt a mixed out-of-plane/in-plane nature in the middle of the -K and -M lines [thus coupling to the (0 0 12) Bragg peak] but revert back to a pure in-plane character in the vicinity of the K point, see Table III in Appendix B. An overview of the measured phonon frequencies, com- pared to Raman and IR spectroscopy data at the  point and to DFT calculation at the , K, and M points, is given in Table I.

CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the complete phonon dispersion relation of MoS2 is determined experimentally in the high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone.
In combination with DFT calculations, the data clearly show the 2D character of the lattice vibrations in this layered crystal.
Therefore, the results are relevant for the monolayer form of MoS2 and isostructural TMDCs as well.
In particular, the understanding of scattering processes involving phonons, such as in electron transport or optical transitions involving the indirect band gap or the two K valleys, will in future be based on the knowledge of the phonon dispersion relation.

144309-5HANS TORNATZKY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 144309 (2019) APPENDIX A: SIMULATION OF IXS INTENSITIES To supplement our experimental data and obtain more insight into the observed relative scattering intensities, we simulated the dynamical structure factor of MoS2 for inelastic x-ray (and neutron) scattering. Following Ref.
[47], we com- pute the one-phonon contribution to the dynamical structure factor for a reduced phonon wave vector q through S(q, ω)hkl ∝ 3Nat  j   d fd(Ghkl + q) √2Md e−Wd (Ghkl+q)(Ghkl + q) · eq jd ei(Ghkl+q)·xd2F DHO q j (ω), (A1) where xd and Md are the position and mass of atom d in the unit cell, respectively, eq jd is the displacement of atom d due to phonon mode j, and Ghkl is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the Bragg peak (h k l).
Nat is the number of atoms in the unit cell, e2Wd is the Debye-Waller factor of atom d, while fd is the wave-vector-dependent form factor and readily available in tabulated form.
We approximate the spectral shape and temperature de- pendence of the structure factor due to electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering by a damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) model [48] F DHO q j (ω) = 4ω π(1 −e¯hω/kBT ) γq j  ω2 −2 q j 2 + 4ω2γ 2 q j , where ωq j and γq j are the angular frequency and linewidth of phonon mode j at wave vector q, respectively.
2 q j = ω2 q + γ 2 q j is the effective frequency of the phonon mode.
The Debye-Waller factor e2Wd is potentially important in our case as it might be different for different atoms/species and cause further qualitative differences of the phonon modes, e.g., modes with smaller or larger oscillations of the molybdenum atoms, in terms of inelastic scattering of x rays.
We thus explicitly included the Debye-Waller factor, with [47] Wd(Ghkl + q) = ¯h 4MdNq  q 3Nat  j 1 ωq j (Ghkl + q) · eq jd 2 · coth  ¯hωq j 2kBT ¯h  , (A2) which requires a sum over Nq vectors in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the crystal.
We found a negligible qualitative de- pendence of our results on Wd.
Frequencies and normal- ized eigenvectors of the phonon modes for the calcula- tion of the dynamical structure factor were obtained from Fourier interpolation along the KM and M paths that we used in our IXS experiments.
The integration over the ﬁrst Brillouin zone in Eq. (A2) was performed over a regular grid of 30 × 30 × 6 q points.
The linewidth γq j could be derived ab initio from calculations of the contributions of electron- phonon and phonon-phonon coupling to the imaginary part of the phonon self-energy, for example using the EPW and D3 codes in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.
However, for reasons of simplicity, we opted for using a value of 0.05 cm−1 in our calculations instead.
The simulated dynami- cal structure factors for the longitudinal and transverse optical modes corresponding to our experimental setups are shown in Fig. 5.
In general, the simulated spectra are in good qualitative agreement with our experimental observations and explain the observed signals and relative intensities for the 12 included optical modes.
In particular, our simulations correctly predict the branches associated to the longitudinal E2u and E1g modes at the  point around 35 meV to be inactive for most of the -K and -M directions in our experimental geometries [54].
This can be understood from the atomic displacement patterns in Tables II–IV.
For these two branches, the two sulfur sublayers in each MoS2 vibrate in opposite phase, causing destructive interference in Eq. (A1).
For wave vectors with a vanishing out-of-plane component, i.e., q = (qg1 qg2 0), the atomic displacements of the sulfur atoms remain perfectly in-plane for most of the -K and -M high-symmetry lines, and the contributions from the vibrating sulfur layers exactly cancel each other out.
At the same time, the contributions to Eq. (A1) from the equilibrium atomic positions xd are equal for all sulfur atoms in a MoS2 layer for the out-of-plane com- ponent qz = 0.
The dynamical structure factor hence vanishes, explaining our observations.
As the contributions to the struc- ture factor within each MoS2 layer cancel, this result does not depend on the relative movement (in-phase or counterphase) of the two MoS2 layers that is the difference between the E2u and E1g modes at . From our simulations, it also does not depend on the Bragg peak used in the measurements as long as the z component of the phonon wave vector is zero.
On the other hand, our DFT calculations suggest that the dispersion of the optical modes is very weak in the out-of- plane, i.e., -A direction.
This feature could be exploited in order to gain experimental access to the full dispersion of the longitudinal E 2u/E 1g branches: A signiﬁcant out-of-plane component of the wave vector should break the symmetry of the vibration of the two sulfur sublayers in each of the MoS2 layers and lift the destructive interference.
Alternatively, one could attempt to break the symmetry of the contributions ei(Ghkl+q)·xd in Eq. (A1) from the equilibrium positions of the sulfur atoms by scattering the x rays off lattice planes (h k l) with l ̸= 0.
Figure 6 shows the simulated dynamical structure factors for a selection of Bragg peaks in -M and “′-M′” (with an offset qz = 1 4) direction.
In all cases, breaking of the sulfur sublayer symmetry activates the longitudinal E 1g or the longitudinal E 2u.
The similarity of the results for qz = 0 and qz = 1 4 suggest that the activation mainly arises from a symmetry breaking of the phase factors from the equilibrium atomic positions, while the contribution from symmetry breaking of the displacement patterns is compar- atively small.
Depending on the choice of Bragg peak used for IXS, the phase factors ei(Ghkl+q)·xd can cause destructive interference between the sulfur sublayers, hence lowering or even extinguishing the scattering intensity, or can cause con- structive interference.
A choice of Bragg peak that properly aligns the signs of the phase factors from the equilibrium atomic positions with the signs of the corresponding con- tributions from the atomic displacement, (Ghkl + q) · eq jd, hence should make the longitudinal E2u and E1g branches 144309- 6PHONON DISPERSION IN MoS2 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 99, 144309 (2019) 250 300 350 400 450 (1/2,1/2,0) (1/3,1/3,0) (a) Frequency (cm -1) 0 21500 Γ-K-M (hkl)=(1,1,0) (0,0,0) M K Γ 250 300 350 400 450 0 11300 M-Γ (hkl)=(2,0,0) (1/2,0,0) (0,0,0) Γ M (b) 250 300 350 400 450 0 14300 Γ-K-M (hkl)=(2,0,0) Frequency (cm -1) (c) (-1/2,1,0) M K (-1/3,2/3,0) (0,0,0) Γ 250 300 350 400 450 0 13600 M-Γ (hkl)=(1,1,0) (-1/2,1/2,0) (0,0,0) Γ M (d) 250 300 350 400 450 (e) 0 13550 Γ-K-M (hkl)=(0,0,12) (1/2,-1,0) M K (1/3,-2/3,0) (0,0,0) Γ Frequency (cm -1) 250 300 350 400 450 0 13600 M-Γ (hkl)=(0,0,12) (0,1/2,0) (0,0,0) Γ M (f) FIG. 5.

This approach is not necessary for the transverse E 2u and E 1g branches.
For these modes, the displacements of the sulfur atoms gain a signiﬁcant out-of-plane component for wave vectors away from the  point, which causes a natu- ral symmetry breaking of the contributions from the atomic displacement patterns.
The two modes hence behave sim- ilarly to the ZO modes and contribute to IXS for a Bragg peak with an out-of-plane component, in case of our 144309-7HANS TORNATZKY et al.

Dynamical structure factors for a selection of experimental geometries that might yield scattering contributions from the Davydov pair of branches associated to the longitudinal E2u and E1g modes at the  point, which we did not observe in our experiments (except near the K point).
The scattering intensity shows a strong qualitative and quantitative dependence of the chosen Bragg peak, while the effect of symmetry breaking through an out-of-plane offset of the phonon wave vectors is small.
experiments (k k l) = (0 0 12).
As our simulations suggest, (k k l) = (2 2 2) or similar combinations of qg1 and qg2 suit- able for transverse modes might work as well or even better along the -K and -M direction.
The situation reverses in the vicinity of the K point: Here, the transverse E2u and E1g modes revert back to completely in-plane displace- ment patterns, while the longitudinal modes evolve into pure out-of-plane vibrations, see Table III.
This causes an ap- parent crossing of the transverse and longitudinal E 2u and E 1g branches close to the K point in both IXS experiments and the simulated dynamical structure factor in Fig. 5(e).
However, the calculated dispersion and the evolution of the atomic displacement patterns along the -K path sug- gest that this apparent crossing is an actual anticrossing and that the scattering intensity is transferred from the (pseudo)transverse modes to the (pseudo)longitudinal modes in the vicinity of the K point.
