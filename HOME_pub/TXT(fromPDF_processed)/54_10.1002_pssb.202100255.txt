Identical Response of Insulators to Irradiations by Swift Heavy Ions: Application to Experiments on Gd2Ti2O7 György Szenes 1.
Introduction The interaction of energetic ions with solids is being investigated with a continuous interest, which is demonstrated by the numer- ous theoretical and experimental studies that have been pub- lished in recent years.
Intensive research activity is going on materials with pyrochlore structures because of their possible applications for the immobilization and disposal of actinides pro- duced in nuclear plants.[1,2] In contrast, these materials are very interesting from a scientiﬁc point of view, as well, as they exhibit a high chemical and structural ﬂexibility, and their structure has a high radiation tolerance.[3] The stability of these solids under irradiation is a key problem for applications.
The irradiation with high-energy heavy ions pro- vides a suitable simulation method for investigation with respect to the long-term effect of actinides.
Systematic studies would be required for making reliable predictions.
However, in spite of the considerable num- ber of publications, only a single pyrochlore Gd2Ti2O7 was studied systematically in a broad range of ion energies E and elec- tronic stopping power Se,[4–6] including track formation, as well.
In this article, quantitative relationships observed in different insulators between the Re 2Se track evolution curves (Re: track radius) are taken into account.
These were ignored in previous analyses.
Based on such observations, recently, there has been considerable progress in the understand- ing of track formation induced by elec- tronic excitation.[7] Concerning the effects of materials parameters (MPs) , it has been shown that track formation is controlled only by the melting temperature Tm in a broad range of ion energies.[7] Besides practical aspects, this is of high theoretical interest, as Tm is an equilibrium parameter; nevertheless, it controls a process under spike conditions.
In this article, the validity of the model is checked for Gd2Ti2O7.
The ion-induced temperature distribution ΔT(r,t) denotes the increase in local temperature T over the irradiation temperature Tir.
It is one of the most important information characterizing the response of solids to the impact of the projectiles.
Therefore, the reliability of theories depends on a great extent on the accuracy of the calculation of the temperature.
The direct comparison with experiments is rather limited in this case and new possibilities are considered.
An emphasis is made throughout the article on the demon- stration of some common features of track formation in various solids.
In this respect, the initial values of the track radii Rin have exceptional importance as various subsequent processes may destroy the existing relationship between them.
In this article, the track evolution is described in Gd2Ti2O7 at low- and high- ion velocities, by applying the Analytical Thermal Spike Model (ATSM).[8] The results in Gd2Ti2O7 and other insulators are com- pared and scaling features are demonstrated.
2. Theoretical Background The most widely studied irradiation effect is the formation of ion-induced tracks.
It was ﬁrst observed in 1959 in mica after exposing to uranium ﬁssion fragments.[9] In the following more than 60 years, the theoretical efforts were concentrated in ﬁnding the right mechanism linking the physical properties of the actual target and the irradiation parameters with the track size.

DOI: 10.1002/pssb.202100255 Track radii Re induced by swift heavy ions are studied.
The experimental track data are analyzed in Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore in the range Se ¼ 654 keV nm1 (Se: electronic stopping power), including irradiations by low- and high-velocity ions.
The Analytical Thermal Spike Model (ATSM) is applied, whose main features are reviewed.
The track data of Gd2Ti2O7 exhibit scaling features which mean simple quantitative relationships with track sizes of other insulators controlled only by a single materials parameter (MP), the melting temperature Tm.
The Re 2Se track evolution curve is described in the whole range of Se without the application of any individual ﬁtting parameter and MPs apart from Tm; the thresholds for track formation are Set ¼ 6.1 and 14.4 keV nm1 for E < 2 MeV/nucleon and E > 8 MeV/nucleon, respectively.
The unique role of Tm is a highly important limitation for the mechanism of track formation.
The practical consequences of the results are discussed with respect to the estimation of irradiation parameters.

physica status solidi (b) basic solid state physics published by Wiley-VCH GmbHHowever, it was shown later that this could not lead to satisfac- tory results as there was found additionally a clear quantitative relationship between track radii induced in different solids by different ions of different energies.[10] These results have been incorporated into the ATSM pub- lished ﬁrst in 1995.[8] In the ATSM, it is assumed that the Gaussian function is a good approximation for the ion-induced temperature distribution.
Equations are derived for the threshold value Set for track formation and for the track evolution function Re 2(Se).[8] When ATSM was applied to track forming insulators, a simple relationship was observed between track radii measured in different insulators.[7] According to this relation, track radii do not depend on MPs other than Tm.
Track radii are controlled by the ion-induced temperature distribution.
When a quantitative relation exists between track radii, there must be a quantitative relation between the induced temperatures, either.
A systematic study of track formation led to revealing that at the moment of maximum peak temperature Tp (t ¼ 0), the ion- induced temperature increase ΔT(r,0) is identical in various insu- lators for 〈se〉¼ constant.[7] This universal-type temperature dis- tribution is given by ΘðrÞ ¼ f se h i 3πkw2 expfr2=w2g (1) where 〈se〉¼ Se/N (N: number density of atoms), f is the efﬁ- ciency, k is the Boltzmann constant, and w ¼ 4.5 nm for insula- tors.
In insulators, low-velocity ions induce larger tracks than high-velocity ions at Se¼ constant and this is called velocity effect (VE).[11] In ATSM, the efﬁciency f is responsible for VE and f  0.17 is valid for E > 8 MeV/nucleon (HI) and it may change to f  0.4[7] in the range E < 2 MeV/nucleon (LO).
Currently, there is no sufﬁcient experimental information for irradiation within the range 8 MeV/nucleon > E > 2 MeV/nucleon, and the shape of the transition of the efﬁciency between the LO and HI values is not known reliably in this range.
The presence of the efﬁciency f in Equation (1) is the demon- stration that the deposited electronic energy is not completely transferred to thermal energy.
Recently, this was conﬁrmed by direct experiments on Y3Fe5O12.[12] The comparison of Equation (1) with the experiments in insulators leads to the con- clusion that the spatial localization of energy deposition in the lattice is characterized by the same value w ¼ 4.5 nm, whatever is E. The term MP is used in the sense of an individual materials property.
Therefore, the common parameters f and w in Equation (1) are not considered as an MP in insulators, though they are obviously parameters that are related to materials.
In semiconductors, however, w is an MP.
Recently, the uniform temperature distribution described by Equation (1) was checked in the analysis of experimental data on electronic sputtering.
Systematic data of ten solids (amorphizable and nonamorphizable insulators and semiconductors) were ana- lyzed assuming a thermal activation mechanism.[13] Excellent agreement was found with the experiments for all solids in a broad range of Se.
The results conﬁrm the validity of Equation (1) when it claims that the ion-induced temperature does not depend on MPs.
It was also found that w ¼ constant in a broad range of induced temperature.
Complete uniformity of the process of track formation is not possible as the atomic stopping power Se/N depends on the composition of the target and 〈se〉¼ constant is required for the uniform temperature distribution.
Actually, ATSM predicts that the track evolution can be described by the equations[8] R2e ¼ w2 lnðSe=SetÞ for Se < 2.7Set (2) R2e ¼ w2Se 2.7Set for Se > 2.7Set (3) Set ¼ πρcðTm  TirÞw2 f (4) where ρ and c are the density and speciﬁc heat.
Often the ρc ¼ 3Nk approximation is used in the equations.
The same equations can be derived from Equation (1) as well.
In the analy- ses according to ATSM, a logarithmic function is ﬁtted to the experimental data in the range Se < 2.7Set (see Equation (2)) and w and f are the two parameters of the model derived from this ﬁt.
In principle, w and f are ﬁtting parameters, but due to speciﬁc features of this effect, they have the same values for var- ious insulators.
When applying ATSM, this procedure cannot be avoided.
When the value of Set provided by another source is used in the analysis, this necessarily modiﬁes the derived values of the w and f parameters and in this case Equation (2)(4) of ATSM do not describe the track evolution any more.
In a review of ATSM by Dufour and Toulemonde, such improper action was made both in the LO and in the HI ranges[14] and the equations with the derived parameters were applied to track data measured in Y3Fe5O12.
Earlier the same data had been already analyzed using ATSM correctly.[15] The comparison of the results of the two analyses with the original experimental data is very instruc- tive.
While the corresponding plot in the study by Szenes et al.[15] shows an excellent agreement with the data, the track sizes cal- culated by Dufour et al.[14] do not even remind us of the original ones.
There are also several similar elementary problems with this review.[14] It is important that Equation (2)–(4) are valid for the initial radius Rin of the amorphous cylindrical volume formed in the thermal spike.
In agreement with the identical temperature dis- tribution expressed by Equation (1), there is a simple unambig- uous quantitative relationship between these track sizes and also between the Re 2〈se〉track evolution curves measured in differ- ent insulators.
This has been proven for a number of insulators in which Rin was measured.[7,16] However, in many experiments, Rin cannot be estimated because of the fast processes of recrystallization or phase trans- formation.
By now, the validity of Equation (1) has been justiﬁed for about 20 insulators.
As originally each one has been selected randomly for the experiment, it is reasonable assuming that the validity extends to a much higher number of insulators including those where Rin cannot be measured.
Actually, the validity of the composition independent, uniform temperature distribution (Equation (1)) must not depend on whether Rin can be measured by the applied experimental techniques or cannot.

Much more systematic track data are necessary for the ﬁnal solution of this problem.
The problems with any theory are revealed when the predic- tions are compared with the experiments.
In this article, such comparison is extended to irradiation experiments on Gd2Ti2O7 and it is shown that the predictions of ATSM are in good agreement with the experiments in a broad range of E and Se.
This analysis diverges from any previous one on this solid as the track evolution is described without using any individual ﬁtting parameters and MPs, except Tm.
This is a rather severe condition when the accuracy and the validity of a model is checked.
3. Experimental Data and their Analysis In the study by Lang et al.,[5] a detailed experimental and theo- retical study is published on track formation induced by swift heavy ions in Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore.
The samples were irradiated by various ions of 11.1 MeV/nucleon initial energy, and transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for the study of the ion-induced struc- tures.
Bright-ﬁeld and high-resolution TEM methods were also used.
The samples were made either by crushing the irradiated specimens or by conventional TEM specimen preparation, includ- ing polishing and ion milling.
The original depth in the irradiated sample is unknown for either types of TEM specimens.
It was found that radii measured by TEM correspond to tracks consisting of an amorphous core and a disordered defect ﬂuorite shell.
However, radii derived from the XRD maxima are related only to the amorphous track core.
Consequently, track radii derived from TEM experiments always exceeded the sizes obtained by the XRD method at the same values of Se.[5] Following other studies,[5] only TEM results were used in this analysis.
It is a reasonable decision as there is no individual adjustable parameter in this model.
Therefore, it is more sensi- tive to the uncertainties of the experimental data than other mod- els.
For the same reason, there is always an endeavor to avoid including those data in the analysis for which the parameters of the model (Tm, f, N) or the experimental conditions (E, Se) are not well deﬁned.
Similarly, those track data could not be used when inhomoge- neous track structures were reported and there was no informa- tion about the initial track size.
A practical solution of the problem is when the measurement of the total track radius is possible as it is close to the initial amorphous size with Rin.
This was done in the study by Lang[5] for Gd2Ti2O7 providing a possibility for the application of ATSM.
A further critical point is that there are no suitable systematic track measurements on pyrochlores other than Gd2Ti2O7.
Obviously, it is very disadvantageous for the application of any model, but especially those without individual adjustable parame- ters, when only a single track size is known.
The uncertainty of the derived parameters is considerably increased in such cases.
This was the reason that some experimental data had to be ignored.
Though this limitation reduces the available database, how- ever, the unambiguous demonstration of a close quantitative relationship between track radii and Equation (1) would not be possible without such limitations.
In the experiment in the study by Lang et al.,[5] the effect of the ion velocity changes in the 40 μm-thick samples as the ion energy varies in the range 11.1 MeV/nucleon < E < 2 MeV/nucleon along the trajectory.[5] While Se  constant along the trajectory, track radii change by more than 50% because of the VE.
Different values of Re could be obtained in this experiment depending on whether the original position of an actual TEM sample was closer to the front side (E ¼ 11.1 MeV/nucleon, HI condition) or to the back side (E ¼ 2 MeV/nucleon, LO con- dition) in the thick specimen.
Thus, the experimental method led to an additional minimum 25% error in the track diameters in ref. [5].
According to the preceding considerations, VE is a source of considerable uncertainty for track studies in these types of irradiation experiments.
In another experiment, Gd2Ti2O7 was irradiated by 120 MeV U ions.[4] The irradiations were conducted with HI ions in the study by Lang et al.[5] All data in the study by Jozwik-Biala[4] belonged to the low-velocity range with E < 2 MeV/nucleon.
Besides monoatomic irradiation by U ions, Gd2Ti2O7 samples were also irradiated by 30 MeV C60 ions that completed the LO data.[16] The experiments in these studies[4,5,16] were conducted in a broad range of Se (6–54 keV nm1) and E (0.04–11 MeV/nucleon).
In Figure 1, track radii induced by HI[5] and LO projectiles[4,16] in Gd2Ti2O7 are shown in a normalized plot where ρc ¼ 3Nk is used.
The internal structure of the tracks is ignored here and the experimental Re radii with an amorphous coreþdefect ﬂuorite shell structure are used as discussed earlier.
In the ﬁgure, the solid lines are the predictions according to Equation (2) with w ¼ 4.5 nm, f ¼ 0.17 for HI irradiations (E > 8 MeV/nucleon), and f ¼ 0.4 for LO irradiations (E < 2 MeV/nucleon).
Equation (2) is valid for Se < 2.7Set and predicts an Re 2∝w2lnSe dependence in agreement with the experiments.
When Se is higher, Re cannot be directly obtained from Figure 1.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseEquation (2) as the maximum radius of the melt is reached at t > 0 during the cooling phase.[8] In this case, Equation (3) and (4) are combined leading to R2e ¼ 1 2.7 f Se 3πkNðTm  TirÞ for Se Set > 2.7 (5) It is remarkable that Equation (5) does not depend on w.
The same is true for Equation (3) as Equation (4) is always valid in ATSM.
This was not realized in the review by Dufour et al.[14] when the value of w was estimated using exclusively Equation (3) and ignoring Equation (4).
This led to a considerable error.
Equation (5) is valid at high values of Se and the dashed curve in Figure 1 was calculated by applying it.
The good agreement between the data (ΔRe/Re  5%, ΔSe/Se  5%) and the theoreti- cal predictions for irradiation by LO ions including C60 irradia- tion when Se and E are known accurately is emphasized.[4,16] The agreement was achieved when Se varied by an order of magni- tude and no individual ﬁtting parameters were used.
This veriﬁes that Equation (2)(5) provide an accurate description of the track evolution in Gd2Ti2O7 that depends only on a single MP, Tm, and ΔT(r,0) is correctly described by Equation (1) with Gaussian width w that does not change with E. The comparison of the track data from the study by Lang et al.[5] with the predicted HI curve shows lower than the expected uncer- tainty in the positions of TEM samples in the thick specimen.
The ﬁgure suggests that except the largest track at Se ¼ 40.1 keV nm1, the original positions of the TEM samples were occasionally in that half of the irradiated specimen which was close to the impact of the projectile.
The agreement of the predicted curve with the experimental data in the HI range is satisfactory when the possible consequences of the thick samples in ref.
[5] (leading to 50% uncertainty for Re 2) are taken into account.
As the random selec- tion of the TEM samples along the thickness in ref.
[5] and the existence of VE in Gd2Ti2O7 are without doubts, the above expla- nation seems to be reasonable.
Thus, this high error is simply the consequence of VE and it is not related to the estimates using ATSM.
When Equation (1) is applied in Figure 1, fSet ¼ ET is obtained for Re ¼ 0, where ET ¼ 3πNkw2(TmTir) is the energy necessary for increasing the maximum temperature of the spike to Tm.
Estimates for the thresholds are Set ¼ 14.4 keV nm1 (HI, f ¼ 0.17, Tm ¼ 2093 K,[6,16] 1/ET ¼ 0.408 nm keV1) and Set ¼ 6.13 keV nm1 (LO, f ¼ 0.4, 1/ET ¼ 0.408 nm keV1).
In Figure 2, the normalized threshold values for track forma- tion 〈set〉are shown for various insulators.
The comparison of the present results with the data in other insulators in Figure 2 shows that these estimates for Gd2Ti2O7 nicely ﬁt the lines in the ﬁgure and verify their reliability.
According to Equation (4), the slope of the line is m ¼ πw2/f in Figure 2 (w ¼ 4.5 nm and f ¼ 0.17/0.4), which is in excellent quantitative agreement (within 5%) with the experiments.
It is an interesting feature of the plot in Figure 2, that it can be used for estimates of the value of Set for transformed tracks as well as they cannot skip this stage of formation.[15] The relationship between track sizes is demonstrated by another plot.
When Equation (2) and (4) are combined, the result predicts that the Re 2〈se〉track evolution curves follow the same lines in an Re 2f〈se〉/3πkw2(TmTir) plot.[7] In Figure 3, such a plot is shown for tracks induced by HI ions ( SrFe12O19,[17] MgFe2O4,[18] NiFe2O4 [19] ZrSiO4,[20] Y2O3 [21]), together with data induced by LO ions (mica,[7] Y3Al5O12,[22] TeO2,[23] Y3Fe5O12,[11,24] Al2O3,[15] KTiOPO4,[25] LiNbO3[26]).
The lines cross the axis at 〈se〉/3πkw2(TmTir) ¼ 1/f providing f  0.4 (LO) and f  0.17 (HI).
The ﬁgure proves that track forma- tion proceeds identically in these solids including Gd2Ti2O7.
This means that similar to the plot in Figure 1, the same description of the track evolution is valid for solids in Figure 3, as well.
It is noted that in Figure 3 the track sizes with highest devia- tions were measured in Y3Fe5O12 HI samples having thicknesses typically over 60 μm in the experiments.
These high deviations are attributed partly to VE along the track length, leading to the formation of larger tracks approaching the backside of the samples.
VE had a similar effect also in Gd2Ti2O5 as 40 μm-thick samples were irradiated, as in the study by Lang et al.[5] An unexpected relationship between track radii measured in different insulators is shown in Figure 4 where the appropriate Figure 2.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseRe values for Gd2Ti2O7 are also included.
Thus, Gd2Ti2O7 belongs to that group of insulators whose response to swift ion irradiations has common features.
It is emphasized that the relationship in Figure 4 has been predicted using ATSM.[10] For deriving this plot, Equation (2) and (4) were combined and a plot was drawn at 〈se〉¼ constant.
Evidently, similar plots can be obtained for other values of 〈se〉as well.
This is an important evidence supporting ATSM.
Figure 4 shows unambiguous evidence, conﬁrming the valid- ity of the thermal mechanism of track formation as Tm is the unique controlling parameter of the process.
Actually, it is in agreement with the assumption of the thermal spike models that amorphous tracks are formed at T ¼ Tm by the fast cooling and solidiﬁcation of the melted cylindrical volume along the trajec- tory of the projectiles.
It is emphasized that the original experimental data have a pri- mary signiﬁcance for any theory.
In this respect, it is highly important that the message of Figure 4 is not modiﬁed by any individual adjustable parameter and other MPs with unreliable values under spike conditions.
It is a remarkably important experimental evidence shown by this plot that MPs apart from Tm (including the heat of fusion) have no effect on the track size.
In the opposite case high devia- tions from the enveloping curve would appear.
This is a serious restriction for any mechanism proposed for the ion-induced track formation.
The plot in Figure 4 is a basic element for the understanding of the mechanism of VE.
In this respect, it is important that the widths of the Gaussian curves are identical for LO and HI irra- diations and only the thermal energy of the spike varies with E. The common behavior shown in Figure 24 is exhibited by about 20 insulators including Gd2Ti2O5.
This is a rather high number as these solids have not been specially selected in the original experiments.
Complete uniformity of the process of track formation is not possible as the atomic stopping power Se/N depends on the composition of the target and 〈se〉¼ con- stant is required for the uniform temperature distribution.
We note that, previously, track evolution has been already ana- lyzed in Gd2Ti2O7, applying the i-TS model[14] requiring an indi- vidual adjustable parameter and the knowledge of a considerable number of MPs under spike conditions and assuming a super- heating scenario.[27] The advantage of the description given by ATSM seems to be without doubt as it is valid in a broader range of Se by applying only a single MP without any individual ﬁtting parameter. 4. Discussion 4.1.
The Role of MPs According to the thermal spike philosophy, the most important information is the accurate description of the ion-induced tem- perature.
ATSM offers a common solution for insulators, whereas it ignores the heat of fusion L and other MPs.
Otherwise, the contribution of L might affect considerably the temperatures.
In a recent paper,[28] this problem was discussed in detail and most of the available systematic experimental track data were analyzed.
The results conﬁrmed that L might have only a minor effect on track formation.
The present analysis of track evolution in Gd2Ti2O7 also refutes the usual argument according to which the good agreement with the experimental track sizes is a sufﬁcient evidence for the validity of a model.
In this case, it would not be possible that several models could lead to equally good agreement with a given set of data, while only one of the proposed models may be valid.
The correct model must provide a complete description of the irradiation effect and explain beyond the track sizes the existing relations between track formations in different solids (e.g., Figure 2–4).
In this article, the theoretical lines in Figure 1 are drawn in agreement with Equation (1), which does not contain any contri- bution of L. As L/ET varies in a broad range in insulators, this large variation ought to lead to considerable shifts of 〈set〉 (crossing of the lines with the X-axis) to higher values in Figure 3.
However, no such deviations can be observed in the ﬁgure.
In contrast, the good agreement with the experiments in a broad range of Se in Figure 1 would not be possible if ignor- ing L were not correct.
The smooth curve in Figure 4 is also strong evidence supporting this conclusion.
The result concerning L has general consequences but, actu- ally, it leads to important conclusions for Gd2Ti2O7, as well.
In the study by Lang et al.,[5] Set ¼ 11.7 keV nm1 is derived for HI tracks that correspond to 4.8 in the X-axis in Figure 3.
In the i-TS model, the threshold Set ¼ 11.7 keV nm1 contains energy for heating to Tm and the contribution of the latent heat as well.[29] Thus, Tm ought to be reached already at about Se 7.7 keV nm1 which corresponds to 7.7  0.408 ¼ 3.14 on the X-axis in Figure 3.
This is about 50% deviation from the value which is derived based on the common behavior of insulators shown in Figure 2–4.
The difference is even higher for LO irradiation as only Set 3 keV nm1 is estimated in the study by Zhang et al.[16] Thus, the induced temperature would reach Tm at about Se ¼ 2 keV nm1, that is even a much lower value.
Consequently, the ion-induced temperatures are much overestimated for Gd2Ti2O7 in the study by Lang et al.[5] While the experimental data Figure 4.

A possible origin of the discrepancy might be that the esti- mates for superheating were made for solids without taking into account the ion-induced transient processes and the highly dam- aged structure of the targets.
These speciﬁc features may affect considerably the proceeding of various processes including phase transition.
As the reliable knowledge of the temperature is the basis for any calculation in the spike, therefore, various estimates made for the irradiated Gd2Ti2O7 are problematic in the study by Lang et al.[5] The same is valid for all those solids whose data are included in Figure 3 and 4 and similar plots.
It is important in this respect that while Y3Fe5O12 is an emblematic insulator for i-TS, the most popular model denying scaling properties of ion- induced tracks,[29] nevertheless, its experimental data ﬁt well with other ones in all those ﬁgures which demonstrate the interdepen- dence of tracks.
This means that the Re 2Se track evolution curve can be calculated easily for Y3Fe5O12 and other solids in Figure 3 and 4 using track data of any other insulator in these ﬁgures.
To do that only Tm values must be known, and other MPs are indifferent.
This has been demonstrated in the study by Szenes,[7] and agreement between the calculated and measured values was found within experimental error.
In the same time, up to ten MPs are required for the description of the same tracks in Y3Fe5O12 [29] and Gd2Ti2O7.[5] However, it remains an open question whether solutions in other studies[5,29] can be consid- ered as a complete solution of the problem when the interdepen- dence of these tracks is not even mentioned.
The possibility of these quite different two solutions is pro- vided by the fact that the width of ΔT(r,0) can be checked by track measurements only at a single temperature, T ¼ Tm.
The shape of ΔT(r,0) cannot be controlled at any other temperature.
Thus, a great number of various distributions with the same width at T ¼ Tm satisfy this simple condition and any deviation from real distribution at T 6¼ Tm is indifferent for the agreement with experiments.
However, when a quantitative relationship is valid between track radii in different solids, then the width of ΔT(r,0) is also determined at several temperatures (see Figure 4); thus, its shape can be checked in several points.
These considerations may be useful for a correct understanding of an agreement between measured and calculated values.
The results indicate that the correct estimation of the tempera- ture is highly important and indispensable in cases when a quan- titative comparison is possible with experiments.
The plots in Figure 24 and the accurate prediction of the Re 2Se track evo- lution curve of Gd2Ti2O7 are sound evidences conﬁrming the validity of Equation (1).
Up to now, the meaning of these ﬁgures has not been discussed and explained in the past 15 years using any other model.
Thus, the readers have no information on how the various models comply with the new experimental limitations.
We see that some important features of track formations can be obtained directly from Equation (1) and Figure 24.
Evidently, the speciﬁc features of the amorphous track core þ disordered shell with a defect ﬂuorite structure in Gd2Ti2O7 cannot be derived from Equation (1).
This is a very complex nanostructural problem.[5] Its discussion is beyond the scope of this article.
5. Conclusion When initial track radii are known in insulators, common scaling features show up and Tm is the only MP which controls the track size.
These scaling features include 1) 〈set〉∝(TmTir) in Figure 2 for the threshold atomic stopping power; 2) common Re 2〈se〉/ (TmTir) track evolution curves in Figure 3; and 3) common ReTmTir Gaussian curve controlled by Tm in Figure 4, con- necting track data measured in various solids for 〈se〉¼ constant.
The validity of these relations is supported by experimental data on ion-induced tracks measured in various insulators including Y3Fe5O12.
This is a serious contradiction as this solid is an emblematic prototype for the i-TS model.
The scaling fea- tures are also demonstrated in Gd2Ti2O7 where the measured Re total track radii with an amorphous coreþdefect ﬂuorite shell structure are close to the initial radii.
The experimental Re 2Se values satisfy the equations of ATSM for a very broad spectrum of Se (654 keV nm1) and E (0.0411 MeV/nucleon) without applying any individual ﬁtting parameter and without MPs except Tm. LO and HI tracks in Gd2Ti2O7 are included in Figure 4 that demonstrates the interdependence of tracks induced in different insulators when 〈se〉¼ constant.
The results on Gd2Ti2O7 conﬁrm the validity of Equation (1), claiming that the ion-induced temperature distributions agree quantitatively in numerous insulators for identical values of 〈se〉.
The estimates of the thresholds for Gd2Ti2O7 are Set ¼ 6.13 and 14.4 keV nm1 for LO and HI projectiles, respec- tively, in agreement with the values derived from the scaling properties.
The heat of fusion L may have only minor if any effect on the track size.
Thus, the assumption of the superheating mechanism is not justiﬁed by the experiments.
It is a source of a systematic error in the calculation of the ion-induced temper- atures that may exceed even 50%.
