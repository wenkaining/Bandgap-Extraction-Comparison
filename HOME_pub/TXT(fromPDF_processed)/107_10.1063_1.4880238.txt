THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 140, 214509 (2014) The length and time scales of water’s glass transitions David T. Limmera) Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, USA (Received 11 December 2013; accepted 16 May 2014; published online 6 June 2014) Using a general model for the equilibrium dynamics of supercooled liquids, I compute from molecu- lar properties the emergent length and time scales that govern the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of amorphous ice prepared by rapid cooling.
Upon cooling, the liquid water falls out of equilib- rium whereby the temperature dependence of its relaxation time is predicted to change from super- Arrhenius to Arrhenius.
A consequence of this crossover is that the location of the apparent glass transition temperature depends logarithmically on cooling rate.
Accompanying vitriﬁcation is the emergence of a dynamical length-scale, the size of which depends on the cooling rate and varies be- tween angstroms and tens of nanometers.
While this protocol dependence clariﬁes a number of pre- vious experimental observations for amorphous ice, the arguments are general and can be extended to other glass forming liquids.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4880238] Glasses of water, or amorphous ices, are nonequilibrium, nonergodic states of matter and as such their properties de- pend intimately on how they are prepared.1 As with other substances, glassy phases of water can be prepared by cooling the liquid, however due to the ease at which water crystallizes cooling rates required to vitrify water are much larger than those typically employed in other glassy-forming materials.2 Understanding how large cooling rates affect the properties of amorphous ice is of considerable interest because experimen- tally water must be cooled at rates greater than 108 K/min, which is up to 8 orders of magnitude greater then those rates utilized when crystallization can be suppressed, such as in aqueous solutions and conﬁned water.3–6 Recently it has been shown that the reversible relaxation kinetics of supercooled water are well described by dynamic facilitation theory.7,8 By adopting recent extensions of this theory to systems ar- rested by cooling,9 the emergent length and time scales that result when liquid water is driven out-of-equilibrium can be computed.
With these scales, the location of the water’s glass transition temperature is shown to depend logarithmically on cooling rate, which is proposed to explain the broad range of previous experimental estimates.4,6,10,11 Dynamic facilitation theory posits that below an on- set temperature, To, reorganization in a supercooled ﬂuid is the result of localized excitations that exhibit no static correlations in equilibrium, but whose dynamics are highly correlated.12 At low temperatures where mobility is sparse, T < To, the concentration of these excitations, c, is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, c ∝exp [−(1/T −1/To)Jσ] , (1) where Jσ is the free energy for creating an excitation in the liquid with surrounding displacement, σ.
The motion of these excitations through the ﬂuid is constrained, such that mobil- ity is more likely to occur near regions that are already mo- bile and the direction of that mobility is preserved over a a)Electronic mail: dlimmer@princeton.edu length scale greater than the size of the excitation.
These ki- netic constraints manifest themselves in dynamic heterogene- ity, stretched exponential decay of time correlation functions and transport decoupling.13 The dynamics that result from these constraints are hierarchical,14 with a logarithmic energy scaling relation for excitations accompanying different dis- placement lengths, Ja′ −Ja = γ Jσ ln a′/a , (2) where γ is a non-universal exponent of order unity that relates the likelihood of two excitations of different sizes meeting.
The constituent relations in Eqs.
(1) and (2) come from solvable lattice models such as the East15 and Arrow models,16 but these basic behaviors also emerge in molecu- lar dynamics simulations.17 By coarse-graining short trajec- tories, in effect mapping molecular dynamics to these lattice models, the microscopic material properties To, Jσ, and γ can be determined.
For water and water-like models at ambi- ent pressure, these properties obey a principle of correspond- ing states such that the onset temperature is approximately given by the temperature of maximum density, experimen- tally corresponding to To ≈277 K, while in units of this temperature, Jσ/To = 23 and γ = 0.63.7 This microscopic procedure has so far only been applied to a few systems,7,17 however the macroscopic consequences of adopting this per- spective have been more systematically studied.
Among other things, the existence of localized excitations obeying these speciﬁed propagation rules determines the temperature de- pendence of the mean structural relaxation time.
This form, known as the parabolic law, has been used to collapse experi- mental data on a wide variety of structural glass formers,18,19 including molecular dynamics models of water7 and nanocon- ﬁned water20 where complications to crystallization can be mitigated.
Below To, the temperature dependence of the mean struc- tural relaxation time is ln τ(T )/τMF = (1/T −1/To)Jσ ln[ℓ(T )/σ]γ , (3) 0021-9606/2014/140(21)/214509/5/$30.00 © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC 140, 214509-1214509-2 David T. Limmer J. Chem.
Phys. 140, 214509 (2014) where at equilibrium the length ℓ(T) is given by ℓ(T )/σ = e(1/T −1/To)Jσ /df .
(4) This length is simply the mean free path between uncorre- lated excitations, whose concentration is determined by the Boltzmann factor in Eq. (1), and df is the fractal dimensional- ity of these paths, which has been determined numerically for three spatial dimensions to be df = 2.6.17 Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (3) gives the more familiar form of the parabolic law.
Below To, the super-Arrhenius temperature dependence ob- served for supercooled liquids can be seen as a consequence of the temperature dependence of this length that increases exponentially with decreasing temperature following the de- creasing number density of excitations.
The proportionality constant τ MF in Eq. (3) is the average time for attempting dis- placements above To.
While this time may have a temperature dependence itself, it is typically weak and for simplicity is as- sumed to be a constant, τ MF ≈2.5 × 10−12 s.20 In order to extend this picture to irreversible relaxation, the protocol that drives the system out-of-equilibrium must be deﬁned.
In this work, only protocols that begin with the system in equilibrium and are cooled at constant rate with magnitude, ν = |T/t|, to a temperature far below the glass transition are considered.
The condition of beginning in equi- librium is critical, as it allows for the application of the the- ory for the reversible dynamics described above.
The constant cooling rate and quench depth are chosen here for simplicity and can be relaxed to accommodate behaviors associated with annealing and aging.
Accordingly, only the mean relaxation, or aging time, within the amorphous ice immediately follow- ing the cooling protocol is considered.
Its temperature depen- dence therefore implies the timescale for relaxation upon re- heating the quenched material.
Under a constant cooling rate, the condition for maintain- ing an equilibrium state is that the rate of change of the exter- nal temperature is slow relative to the corresponding change in the relaxation time of the system.
This condition, or rather where it breaks down, deﬁnes the glass transition tempera- ture, Tg, where the system falls out-of-equilibrium.
The iden- tiﬁcation of a single temperature is well deﬁned only in-so-far as relaxation occurs in stages with well separated timescales.
For the hierarchical dynamics considered here, this is exactly what happens.
Speciﬁcally, as has been pointed out previ- ously by Sollich and Evans for the East model,21 in the limit of vanishing concentration of excitations, relaxation of differ- ent domains occur in stages separated by O[ℓ(T )].
Therefore, on a timescale less than τ(Tg), only domains less than ℓ(Tg) are likely to relax, leaving excitations separated by distances greater than this length arrested for T < Tg and times less than τ(Tg).
Given this time scale separation for the model dynamics considered here, Tg can be deﬁned implicitly by the differen- tial relationship, dτ dT  Tg = ν−1 .
(5) Assuming that Tg is on the order of To, Eq. (5) can be evalu- ated and substituted into Eq. (4) to give the mean nonequilib- FIG.

Following Eq. (5), the location of the crossover to Ar- rhenius temperature dependence of τ indicates the glass transition tempera- ture, Tg.
Following Eq. (7), locations where dashed lines increase to log τ/ps = 14 deﬁne the apparent glass transition temperature, Tag as a function of cooling rate.
While only the limiting behaviors at high and low temperature are directly observable for water, the implications of these mean timescales are pronounced, as discussed in the text.
rium distance between excitations, ℓ(T < Tg) ≈ℓne ≈σ exp  −ln(˜ν)/γ df  , (6) where ˜ν = 2ντoJ 2 σ γ/dfT 3 o is a dimensionless cooling rate.
Following the arguments above, this length scale in the glassy phase is indicative of correlations generated in the material out-of-equilibrium that exist until the material is warmed.
Un- like in equilibrium where the mean distance becomes increas- ingly large upon cooling, in the arrested state the length is frozen into the structure of the material and thus no longer changes appreciably with temperature.
Correspondingly, be- low Tg the timescale of relaxation no longer has an additional temperature dependence from ℓ(T).
Therefore, in the amor- phous ice, the relaxation changes from the parabolic form to an Arrhenius form.
Figure 1 shows the predicted relaxation time as a func- tion of temperature for different cooling rates.
As with all of the results presented in this paper, the parameters have been independently computed from microscopic calculations.
The reversible liquid relaxation is predicted to be a smooth, mono- tonically increasing function given by Eq. (3) and ℓ(T) in Eq. (4).
The irreversible glassy relaxation is given by Eq. (3) and ℓne in Eq. (6) with τ MF determined by equat- ing both curves at T = Tg.
These equations predict that for systems prepared by cooling rates that are slower than 1 K/min, follow the reversible curve over the timescales con- sidered.
Cooling rates that exceed 1 K/min however, exhibit a crossover to an Arrhenius temperature dependence.
For faster rates, this crossover occurs at higher temperatures, corre- sponding to the system falling out of equilibrium from per- turbations with shorter characteristic timescales.
For bulk water, fast cooling rates are required due to the rapid rate of crystallization, therefore only indirect evidence of this crossover is observable.
Nevertheless, a testable pre- diction of this theory follows from Eqs.
(3), (4), and (6) from which the change in slope at this crossover point can be eval- uated.
By construction, ℓ(Tg) = ℓne, so the change in slope of the relaxation time evaluated at Tg, is invariant to cooling214509-3 David T. Limmer J. Chem.
Phys. 140, 214509 (2014) rate.
Though indirect for water, this crossover is observable for other glass forming liquids and, for example, is illustrated in Ref.
22 complete with a change in slope of approximately 1/2 as predicted from the above equations.
While the abrupt- ness of the crossover is a product of assuming the relaxation time is given by a single length scale, corrections to this ap- proximation will certainly smooth the crossover.
However, to the extent that the distribution of lengths after the cooling pro- tocol is sharply peaked around its mean value, as has been shown in Ref. 9, then for T < Tg, τ(T) will be well deter- mined by this mean ﬁeld approximation.
For water, while the crossover itself is not observable, both the higher temperature behavior of the liquid and the low temperature behavior of the amorphous ice can be observed and be used to verify this prediction.
The changing temperature dependence in τ(T) is a con- sequence of falling out of equilibrium, arresting the liquid and forming a glass.
As such it is expected to be a gen- eral feature of supercooled liquids driven from equilibrium and thus distinct from observations of crossovers noted pre- viously for water under nano-conﬁnement.23 Observations in conﬁned water are made from nominally equilibrium mea- surements in pores whose disordered surfaces and sizes frus- trate crystallization.20 The speciﬁc origin of this behavior is the subject of debate,23 however previous work suggests that it is due to freezing in conﬁnement.20 The behavior detailed here is, however, related to previously inferred transitions that have been invoked to either explain the weak thermal response upon heating hyper-quenched amorphous ice24 or the variabil- ity in temperature dependence of the relaxation time at the glass transition.25 Indeed, crossovers of this sort have been previously postulated to reconcile the location of water’s Tg with ﬁts to the equilibrium liquid relaxation time,26 however in this work the crossover is explicitly considered a nonequi- librium effect, not predicted to occur in the reversible behav- ior of liquid water.
Because of the crossover in temperature dependence of the mean relaxation time, there exists a temperature below Tg where the system will begin to relax on laboratory timescales.
This transition to a softening glassy state is denoted the appar- ent glass transition temperature, Tag.
In water this transition is often followed by abrupt crystallization, which does not allow for the complete recovery of the liquid.
The apparent glass transition temperature is deﬁned by τ(Tag) = 100 s, or for ν > 1 K/min, T −1 ag = T −1 o + ln(100s/τMF)/Jσ  −ln(˜ν)γ/df , (7) otherwise for ν ≲1K/min Tag equals the temperature where the extrapolated liquid relaxation time reaches 100 s, which for water is about 180 K.7 While, Eq. (7) refers explicitly to where relaxation takes place on timescales of 100 s this can be generalized.8 Figure 2 plots the apparent glass transi- tion temperature, which is shown to depend logarithmically on cooling rate.
This dependence is irrelevant to many experi- ments on glass forming liquids, as cooling rates usually range between 1–10 K/min.
However, for water, this dependence is crucial because cooling rates greater than 108 K/min are used in order to bypass crystallization.
Cooling rates that are less than 1 K/min do not change Tag, as these perturbations would FIG.

cause the system to fall out of equilibrium at larger charac- teristic timescales than 100 s.
However, cooling rates greater than 1 K/min are expected to affect the observed Tag system- atically, with changes of over 50 K expected for cooling rates that vary between 10–108 K/min. Similar logarithmic cooling rate dependences have been noted experimentally for other network-forming liquids,27,28 and in simulations,29 however this work seems to be the ﬁrst to derive such a dependence from microscopic properties.
This distinction between Tg and Tag has been noted previously by Angell, who called this soft- ening and its associated thermal response a “shadow glass transition,” however this work is the ﬁrst to give a quantiﬁ- able mechanistic explanation.30 The logarithmic dependence of Tag for water on cool- ing rate explains the apparent contradiction between dielectric measurements and extrapolated calorimetry measurements.4 Dielectric measurements directly probe the timescale for molecular reorganization and designate the location of the glass transition temperature according to the deﬁnition in Eq. (7).
Accordingly, estimates for the location of the glass transition with samples cooled at rates between 107 and 108 K/min yield values near 130–140 K in agreement with the re- sults for Tag presented here.3 Alternatively, calorimetry mea- surements probe the recovery of the liquid upon heating from the glass and designate the temperature where the system falls out of equilibrium as the location of the glass transi- tion, corresponding to the deﬁnition of Tg in Eq. (5).
While these measurements are not directly possible in bulk water as crystallization interferes, extrapolations using data for aque- ous solutions11 and measurements of water in conﬁnement6 both yield values for Tg between 160 and 180 K. While ex- trapolation from bulk water behavior to water in conﬁne- ment or concentrated solution is not straightforward, previ- ous work has shown that in many instances effects from these perturbations result in small corrections to Jσ, To, and τ MF.20 Figures 1 and 2 show that it is only when cooling rates are on the order of 1 K/min or slower are expected to yield Tg ≈Tag.
This argument against a value of Tg for water near 140 K presumes that observations of a weak thermal response for hyper-quenched or otherwise prepared amorphous ice near that temperature is not indicative of a recovering liquid state, but rather is a nonequilibrium response to impending214509-4 David T.

The smallness of the observed heat capacity relative to the known equilibrium liquid value31 suggests that this is a reasonable perspective, nevertheless it stands as an implicit assumption to the interpretation of this theory as ap- plied to water.
Note however that the deﬁnition of Tg em- ployed here is where the liquid falls out of equilibrium, which in order to bypass crystallization must occur at temperatures greater the limit of homogeneous nucleation, 220 K.5 The nonequilibrium length deﬁned in Eq. (6) is plotted in Fig. 3 with σ = 2.5 Å. While generated by an intrinsically dy- namic process, this length is a static measure of correlations in the arrested phase and as such is similar to other lengths previously discovered in arrested amorphous matter.32 Apart from determining the mean relaxation time, the magnitude of this length gives a geometrical explanation on the stability of a glass.9 For a given temperature, glasses produced with slower cooling rates relax on exponentially longer times as their ex- citations must overcome ever-increasing distances in order to relax.
The weak thermal response upon heating through Tag that hyper-quenched water exhibits31 is a manifestation of the weak correlations between excitations that result under such rapid cooling protocols, which when overcome in hyper- quenched water result in crystallization.
Such a dependence of the thermal response on this correlation length and the corre- sponding scaling of this correlation length with cooling rate should be observable by small angle x-ray scattering exper- iments in amorphous ice at low temperatures, prepared with different cooling rates.
These correlations, which likely re- sult in additional scattering intensity at wave vectors inversely proportional to ℓne, are left as a veriﬁable prediction of the microscopic theory applied here.
Cooling rates in excess of 106 K/min must be used to directly vitrify water, thus other protocols may need to be used in order to generator amor- phous ices with larger nonequilibrium lengths.
While a lim- ited range of cooling rates for water are practically available experimentally, in principle this dependence of length scale on cooling rate is generic to glass forming systems and could be realized directly in aqueous solutions, albeit with different Jσ, To.γ , and τ MF.
In this work, the distribution of excitations is treated in a mean ﬁeld way with one dominate length scale determin- ing relaxation.
More complicated nonequilibrium protocols, such as pressure amorphization, annealing, and polyamorphic transitions, likely generate distributions of excitations charac- terized by signiﬁcantly different correlations.
By preparing a material with a more complex protocol it is therefore possible that multiple length scales might be required for an adequate description of relaxation.
For instance, the signiﬁcant pressure dependence of Jσ 8 dictates that amorphous ice produced at high pressure is characterized by a nonequilibrium length that is different from a corresponding sample of amorphous ice produced at low pressure.
Depending on the relative ordering of these lengths, and if they are signiﬁcantly separated, re- laxation of a high pressure amorphous ice heated at low pres- sure could require a description of relaxation that incorporates both length scales as typical thermal ﬂuctuations could relax regions characterized by the shorter of these two lengths at lower temperatures than required to relax the entire system.
Such a construction can potentially explain observations by Amann-Winkel et al.33 of multi-step relaxation behavior.34 This work presents expressions describing the nonlinear response for the simplest nonequilibrium protocol applied to a supercooled liquid: cooling with a speciﬁed constant rate.
As alluded to above, many of the simpliﬁcations made for al- gebraic convenience are not necessary for numerical compu- tations.
Indeed, the consequences of annealing and aging can be taken into account with simple numerical calculations.35 By combining these expressions with the theory for ther- mal response provided in Ref. 9, the consequences of hyper- quenching rate on the response observed by calorimetry can be analyzed.
That speciﬁc study is left for future work.
Though the focus of this work is on the relaxation behav- ior of water, where the parameters entering that theory have been determined independently from microscopic principles without adjustment, the general phenomena accompanying driving a liquid into an amorphous arrested state are generic.
Supercooled liquids relax with an ever decreasing rate as the temperature is lowered, with dynamics that are hierarchical.
When their structure is arrested any conﬁgurationally rare re- gion that allows for relaxation becomes frozen in.
Therefore, it must be that irreversible relaxation in such an otherwise non-reorganizing material be governed by a temperature in- dependent energy scale.
