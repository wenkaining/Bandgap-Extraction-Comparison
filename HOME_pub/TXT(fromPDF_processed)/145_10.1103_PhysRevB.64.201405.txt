We show that a novel instability may be present in resonant tunneling through a quantum well in one, two, and three dimensions, when the resonance lies near the emitter Fermi level.
A simple semiclassical model which simulates the resonance and the projected density of states by a nonlinear conductor, the Coulomb barrier by a capacitance, and the time evolution by an iterated map, is used.
The model reproduces the observed hysteresis in such devices, and exhibits a series of bifurcations leading to fast chaotic current ﬂuctuations.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.64.201405 PACS number~s!: 73.40.Gk,72.15.Gd Resonant tunneling through a double barrier, originally a rather elementary academic exercise, has already shown to be an extremely rich source of new and surprising physics for over three decades.1 One instance is the bistable region in the I–V characteristic that some samples exhibit, leading to hysteresis as the curve is traced ﬁrst increasing and then decreasing the bias.2–8 This effect is currently understood as caused by the interaction of the current ﬂowing through the device with the charge trapped in the well formed between the barriers.3 Calling Q this charge, its effect on the incoming electrons may be viewed as an increase in the local potential by Q/C, where C is the capacitance, lifting the resonance level in the same amount.
The latter can thus be somewhat above or below the emitter conduction band edge at the same bias, depending on whether the well is charged or un- charged.
Since in the ﬁrst case there is current ﬂow through the well and in the second there is none, both cases are physically consistent, and in fact, observed experimentally.
As an application, it has been suggested that in the bistable region the device may act as a THz detector and fast switch.9,10 Another instance are the THz oscillations that may arise in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in the direction of the current ﬂow, which become chaotic if the ﬁeld is sufﬁciently strong.11–13 In contrast with the hysteresis effect described above, these oscillations are associated with passage of the resonance across the emitter Fermi level.
Assuming the reso- nance is initially above the emitter Fermi sea and off reso- nance, it will eventually enter the latter as the bias is in- creased, allowing electrons to tunnel into the well.
Thus, with a certain time constant, charge begins to build up be- tween the barriers.
The Coulomb repulsion between this charge layer and the incoming electrons effectively causes an upward shift of the bottom of the well, and hence, also of the resonance state.
This may drive the system off-resonance again until the charge, due to the ﬁniteness of the barrier and the associated ﬁnite lifetime of the resonance state, has tun- neled out again into unoccupied states on both the emitter and collector sides.
The resonance then is no longer sus- tained above the Fermi energy by the decreased charge in the well, the resonance falls again and a new cycle begins.
Whether this oscillation is damped away or not, is deter- mined by the strength of the interaction, which in turn de- pends on the projected density of states in the emitter at or near the Fermi energy.
By changing the proﬁle in the density of states the magnetic ﬁeld enhances this coupling, and, if large enough, induces the system to perform sustained oscil- lations.
The purpose of this work is to show that, under fa- vorable conditions, the oscillations may also be present in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, as well as in situations of lower dimensionality such as tunneling through a quantum wire or dot.
We model the system by a simple circuit that captures the essence of the system under discussion, shown in Fig. 1.
As follows from the discussion below, it includes the following features that appear to be essential in the description of the device: ~1!
the existence of a resonance state with an associ- ated lifetime, which results in a time delay between the bias voltage and the buildup or decay of the charge in the well ~‘‘tunneling time’’!; ~2!
the existence of a Fermi sea on the emitter side, with a density of states depending on the dimen- sionality of the device ~bulk, planar, or linear!, and on the magnetic ﬁeld, if present; ~3!
the existence of the Coulomb repulsion between the charge trapped in the well and the incoming electrons.
The nonlinear element in the circuit rep- resents transmission from the emitter side into the well, al- lowing a charge DQ~t,t1t!5tImaxf~V! ~1!
to leave the source U0 in the time interval t.
The dimension- less nonlinear function f(V), depending on the voltage V 5U02U between emitter and well, is the convolution of the transmissivity of the resonance with the number of occupied states in the emitter, available for tunneling.
This latter quan- tity may be written as FIG. 1.
Model circuit for a double barrier device.
The function f(V) represents the response for tunneling into the well formed by the barriers.

where u(x) is the Heaviside step function, Er is the energy of the resonance level at zero bias, and EF , the Fermi en- ergy.
All energies and voltages are assumed to be in electron- volts and measured with respect to the bottom of the conduc- tion band on the emitter side.
The quantity rd(V) represents the number of states in the emitter side, with the component of kinetic energy along the current ﬂow, equal the resonance energy shifted by the bias V. It is given by rd~V!5ad~eV1EF2Er!d21/2. ~3!
Here ad is a constant depending on the dimensionality d 51,2, or 3 of the emitter ~the well has dimension d21).
The values are, a152,a252LA2m*/(p\), a35m*L2/(p\2), where L is the emitter width and m* the effective mass of the carriers.
The capacitance C represents the Coulomb barrier.
As charge ﬂows through the nonlinear element, entering the well, the voltage drop V5U02U is reduced.
At the same time charge is allowed to leave the well through the collector represented by the load resistor R. These elements deﬁne a time constant t05RC characterizing the rate at which the well may be emptied.
With these deﬁnitions the conservation of charge provides an equation of motion for the voltage U(t) on the output side of the device, C@U~t1t!2U~t!#5DQ2t U~t! R . ~4!

The map has ﬁxed points given by V*5U02RImaxf~V*!. ~6!
A simple linear analysis in the neighborhood of one of these ﬁxed points shows that for it to be stable the condition 21,RImax df dV uV*,2/g21 ~7! must be satisﬁed.
It follows that for either an increasing or decreasing function f(V) at the ﬁxed point, an instability occurs provided the local derivative is sufﬁciently large in absolute value for the above condition to be violated.
For a sharp resonance the function f(V) will essentially follow the proﬁle given by Eq. ~3!
within the window Er2EF<V < Er , becoming negligibly small elsewhere.
The ﬁnite reso- nance width smoothens the edges deﬁned by the top and bottom of the Fermi sea.

The expression in parenthesis is a positive deﬁnite funtion of V resembling a hat, giving f(V) such shape for d51 since then rd(V) is a constant; for d52 and 3, f(V) rather re- sembles an asymmetric hat.
For convenience we call it the ‘‘hat function’’ in what follows.
The ﬁxed points, as determined by Eq. ~6!, may be found graphically as the intersection of the straight line through the origin, F5V, and the curve representing the right hand side of that equation.
Because of the inverted hat form of the latter one can easily verify that there are either one, or three ﬁxed points, as illustrated in Fig. 2, depending on the size of the external bias U0.
The ﬁgure is for the d53 case, with parameters as given below.
When there are three solutions, the one in the middle ~MFP, square in the ﬁgure!
occurs at the rather steep fall of the arctg function, yielding a likely unstable ﬁxed point according to the criterion given in Eq. ~7!.
The intersection furthest to the right ~RFP, triangle in the ﬁgure!
occurs in the ﬂat portion of the hat function and is therefore stable.
We are interested in the leftmost ﬁxed point ~LFP, the circles in the ﬁgure!, representing the intersection located in the left side of the hat function.
As U0 varies and the overall curve raises, the intersection closely follows the functional form of the number of states available for tunneling, Eq. ~3!.
We ﬁrst consider the d51 case, for which r1(V) ﬁrst rises abruptly as a step function, thereafter remaining constant in the relevant region.
The LFP then traces the contour of the arctg function, whose steep variation will generally violate the stability condition ~7!.
The situation is as in the d53 case with magnetic ﬁeld, since the latter modiﬁes the spectra in the emitter transforming it into a series of quasi-one- dimensional dispersion laws, and for which the instability is known to exist.11 For d52, there is a square root dependence at the LFP intersect, and if the resonance width G is sufﬁ- ciently small the diverging local derivative will cause the stability condition again to be violated near the edge ~the Fermi energy!.
The d53 case needs closer attention because of the linear form of r3(V).

where Dz is the separation between the barriers, and e,e0 are the dielectric constants of the enclosed material and the vacuum, respectively.

the simple sta- bility condition 1.3Dz~nm!,22g, ~10!
where the distance Dz is to be given in nanometers.
This condition is easily violated in actual samples.
We have done numerical studies in order to verify the presence of the instability, and have found it to occur in all three cases discussed above.
Figure 3 shows the I–V curves for the ~a! d51, ~b! d52 and ~c!
d53 cases, in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
The parameters used in the ﬁgure are g 50.5, G51 meV, EF520 meV, Er543 meV, and Dz 513 nm, appropriate for typical devices based on AlxGa12xAs.
It is also necessary to specify some short cross sectional dimensions in cases ~a! and ~b!, chosen as DxDy 5100 nm2 and Dx510 nm in the ﬁgure, respectively.
For these values, at low external bias U0 the device is always stable.
Yet, as the voltage increases and current starts to ﬂow due to the entrance of the resonance in the Fermi sea, the iteration ~5! does not settle to a ﬁxed point but rather ﬂuctu- ates in steps t, ﬁrst regularly ~bifurcations region in Fig. 3!
and then, at larger bias, in a chaotic fashion.
This shows that the system becomes unstable.
At still larger voltages the bi- furcation process unfolds until the system is stable again.
The data shown are for an increasing bias.
If the external voltage is then decreased, the system remains in the RFP stable state ~triangle in Fig. 2! for as long as there are three solutions to Eq. ~6!.
The values of the critical bias at which these solutions decrease in number from three to one for panels ~a!, ~b!, and ~c! of Fig. 2 are 49 mV,60 mV, and 53 mV, respectively.
The case with magnetic ﬁeld and d53, not shown, produces a similar ﬁgure for large enough ﬁeld, as expected from results reported previously.11,12 In summary, we have shown that an instability induced by the interaction of the current with the trapped charge may appear in resonant tunneling through constrictions in one, two, and three dimensions, when the resonance is close to the Fermi level.
Instead of integrating the quantum mechani- cal equations of motion as done previously for the d53 case with magnetic ﬁeld,11 we have used a circuit model with the advantage of mathematical simplicity and the possibility of an analytical discussion of the stability in all three dimen- sions.
Experimental accessibility of the instability may re- quire testing emission or absorption of THz radiation.
Usual electronics will normally just register a time average of the oscillations because of the small value of their typical period, which, for a resonance of 1 meV width in a GaAs quantum well would be of the order of 4 ps.
