https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5047863 I. INTRODUCTION Since its advent, the Kohn-Sham (KS)1 density functional theory (DFT) is a de facto standard theoretical framework for studying the electronic structures of atoms, molecules, and materials.
The accuracy of the KS DFT depends on the accuracy of the approximate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals.
Due to the reasonable computational cost with comparatively well-balanced accuracy, the semilocal nature of the exchange-correlation functionals, i.e., the local density approximations (LDA),2 generalized-gradient approximations (GGAs),3–16 and meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs),17–40 is widely used for the bulk properties of solids.41–56,58 The mainstream of semilocal density func- tionals is developed based on the satisfaction of desirable constraints8–16,20–24,29,30 or modeling the exchange hole30 or both.30 Usually, benchmarking the density functional approx- imations against the experimental ﬁndings is a common practice to measure the accuracy and applicability of the approximation, in particular, when a new functional is intro- duced.
Indeed, the systematic evaluation of the properties of a density functional approximation guides users to properly choose a functional for describing the material properties.
Also, it becomes easier to improve upon the functionals if a)Electronic mail: subrata.jana@niser.ac.in b)Electronic mail: psamal@niser.ac.in one knows the functional behavior for the wide range of systems.
This paper assesses the performance of the recently pro- posed meta-GGA functionals for the bulk properties of the alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
More speciﬁcally, we consider the lattice constants (or equilibrium shortest dis- tances), bulk moduli, and cohesive energies of transition met- als.
It is well known that in spite of the various difﬁculties in describing the structural and energetic properties of transi- tion metals, the outcomes of DFT remain surprisingly accu- rate within different levels of approximations.41 Regarding the performance of different levels of exchange-correlation (XC) approximations for the bulk properties of transition met- als, earlier studies are made within the framework of GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals theory.
Janthon et al.48 studied the transition metals within the framework of GGA based functionals.
Janthon et al.49 further explored the behav- ior of transition metals by including meta-GGA and hybrid level functionals.
Besides that, Haas et al.,50 Csonka et al.,52 Tran et al.,51 Schimka et al.,53 Hao et al.,54 and Zhang et al.55 partly covered the lattice constants, cohesive energies, and bulk moduli of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
In this work, we perform studies involving the lattice con- stants (or inter-atomic distances), cohesive energies, and bulk moduli of the alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals within the framework of the recently developed meta-GGA functionals.

Recent advances towards meta-GGA level functionals show that the accuracy of the functionals can be further improved by imposing more exact constraints on the func- tional construction.
Especially, the SCAN and TM functionals show greater accuracy for the wide range of solid-state prop- erties.
Though the performance of the SCAN functional has been studied for bulk properties of most of the metals,51,56,57 the TM functional remains untested for these properties.
Here, we present the benchmark calculations of the bulk properties of the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, alkali, and alkaline earth metals by considering most of the modern meta-GGA den- sityfunctionals(TPSS,modTPSS,oTPSS,revTPSS,regTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM), and the GGA [Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)8 and PBE functional parameterized for solids (PBEsols)12] based semilocal func- tionals.
It is noteworthy to mention that due to the different nature of bonding present in the alkali, alkaline-earth, and tran- sition metals, these are often considered as the difﬁcult cases within semilocal exchange-correlation functionals.
Though these are considered mainly as prototype metals and metallic bonding dominates, but the weak van der Waals interactions in closed semi-core states also play an important role.53,65 These pose additional difﬁculty for the semilocal function- als to accurately describe all the bonding nature, and often in the benchmark calculations, these are excluded. It is shown in Ref.
53 that the PBE functional does not perform satisfactorily in describing the lattice constants of all these metals.
The PBE functional predicts the lattice constants of 3d transition metals quite well, but overestimates the lattice constants for the 4d and 5d metals.
ItisalsoshowninRef.53thatthesituationimproves through the inclusion of the kinetic-energy density term in the functional construction.
Due to the one electron free correla- tion of the revTPSS functional, it performs reasonably for the transition metal lattice constants.
All these previous studies motivate us to assess the accuracy of the recently developed meta-GGA level semilocal functionals in predicting the afore- mentioned bulk properties.
It is noteworthy to mention that the SCAN functional includes the intermediate van der Waals (vdW) interaction.29 Therefore, it is interesting to assess its performance for alkali and alkaline-earth materials, where the bonding is inﬂuenced by the vdW interaction in the semi-core states.
Regarding the TM functionals, it is shown that both the TM and TPSS correlation perform differently with the TM exchange.30 In this paper, we shed light on the behavior on the recent meta-GGA functional performance.
To do so, we organize our paper as follows: In the following, we will describe our com- putational setup along with the test set used for benchmarking.
Following that, we will study the inter-atomic distances, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies of the transition metals.
Based on the study, we will conclude by discussing and comparing the results. II.
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS All computational studies are performed self-consistently using the plane wave code based on the projector-augmented method “Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).”59–64 The bulk calculations are performed with 16 × 16 × 16 Gamma-centered k-points.
For the atomic calculations of cohesive energies, a simulation box of 18 × 19 × 20 Å3 is considered with 1 × 1 × 1 Gamma-centered k-points.
The spin polarization calculations are performed for atoms.
An energy convergence criterion of 10−6 eV has been set for bulk cal- culations, whereas the atomic simulations are performed with the energy convergence criterion of 10−5 eV. The energy cut- offs 500 eV to 700 eV are used for bulk calculations, whereas 700 eV to 1000 eV are used for the atomic calculations.
All the bulk electronic structure calculations are performed con- sidering non-spin polarization, except ferromagnetic Fe, Ni, and Co.
The results presented in the table are arranged by sepa- rating out the 3d transition metals, 4d transition metals, 5d transition metals, alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), and alkaline-earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba).
Under the ambient condition, all the alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, and tran- sition metals show face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), or hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures.
Only exceptions are Mn, La, and Hg.
These materials show com- plicated hexagonal (La), rhombohedral (Hg), and cubic unit cells with 58 atoms (Mn).
Due to the very different structures of La, Hg, and Mn, these are also discussed separately in all tables.
In this work, we report the equilibrium inter-atomic dis- tances (δ).
The inter-atomic distances are calculated from the equilibrium lattice constants depending on the structures.
For example, the inter-atomic distances of fcc and bcc structures are 1/ √ 2 and √ 3/2 times the lattice constants (a0).
Regarding the hcp structure, δ = p c2/4 + a2/3, where a and c are the two lattice constants of the hcp structures.
The bulk modulus (B0) is deﬁned as the variation of the volume (V) due to the external pressure (P).
In DFT, the bulk modulus is measured at the equilibrium lattice constant a0 or volume (V0) as B0 = −V0  ∂P ∂V  a=a0 .
(1) Several equations of state (EOSs)66–69 are available to ﬁt the energy versus volume curve for obtaining bulk moduli.
However, in the present case, we use the fourth order Birch- Murnaghan equation of state66,69 through the post-processing tool for VASP code (VASPKIT)70 to ﬁt and obtain the bulk moduli of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A. Equilibrium inter-atomic distances In Table I, we present the benchmark calculation for the equilibrium inter-atomic distances.
The experimental values presented in Table I are subtracted for the zero-point vibra- tional effects (ZPVEs).
As mentioned before, the equilibrium inter-atomic distances depend on the equilibrium lattice con- stants according to the different lattice structures.
For the details of the relation between the inter-atomic distances and equilibrium lattice constants, the readers are suggested to go through Ref. 48.
In Fig. 1, we also show the percent- age deviation of our calculated values.
Though the calcula- tions for the PBE, PBEsol, M06L, TPSS, and revTPSS are reported in past for several solids, in the present study, we recalculate all the functionals for all solids along with the recentlydevelopedmeta-GGAs.
Inthissection,wewilldiscuss the functional performances according to the data present in Table I.
The results in Table I follow a clear trend throughout.
Different functionals perform differently in predicting the inter-atomic distances because of the underlying construc- tion methodology and constraint satisfaction.
To start with, reasonably good performance is observed for the PBE GGA functional throughout the series.
It yields fairly accurate inter- atomic distances for the 3d transition metals and obtains the least error.
While it overestimates the inter-atomic distances for the 4d and 5d transition metals.
Concerning the PBEsol functional, it underestimates the inter-atomic distances more compared to the PBE functional for 3d transition metals.
It is noticeable for the 3d transition metals that the PBEsol functional yields very good inter-atomic distances for Sc and Ti, but underestimates the inter-atomic distances for other 3d metals in this series.
Though the PBEsol satisﬁes the slowly varying electron gas limit by restoring the gradient approx- imation of Svendsen and von Barth,71 the PBE functional yields improved performance in this regard.
The overestima- tion behavior of PBE and PBEsol can be explained from the self-interaction within the d shell, which increases with the d-band ﬁlling.53 Within the 3d transition metals, the ferro- magnetic Fe, Co, and Ni are known to be the most difﬁcult cases for the semilocal functionals due to strong correlation.
Several attempts beyond the density functional approxima- tions are proposed to better the performance.74–77 However, quite satisfactory performance is observed using the PBE functional.
Now, we discuss the performance of meta-GGA function- als.
The TPSS meta-GGA functional shows a PBE-like trend for the 3d transition metals.
The TPSS functional improves the inter-atomic distances for Sc and Ti compared to PBE and shows underestimation for other 3d transition metals.
On the other hand, the revised version of it, i.e., revTPSS, underestimates the inter-atomic distances of 3d transition met- als compared to the TPSS functional for all the 3d elements by almost 1-3 picometer (pm).
However, the TPSS performs PBE-like for 4d and 5d transition metals and overestimates the inter-atomic distances.
The revTPSS follows the same trends as TPSS does.
But, overestimation and underestima- tion tendency is less pronounced in the case of revTPSS.
Most interestingly, the revTPSS closely follows the PBEsol results because both are constructed from the same physical point of view, i.e., to improve the solid-state performances.21 With the d band ﬁlling, the revTPSS gradually switches to PBEsol-like because the total charge density becomes the sum of several one-electron orbitals.53 In addition to the conventional meta-GGA functionals, here we also include the TPSS based modiﬁed function- als, oTPSS and modTPSS.
Both the oTPSS and modTPSS functionals are the parameterized form of TPSS, designed to perform better for the molecular test sets.
The modiﬁed param- eters of oTPSS and modTPSS are taken from Refs. 27 and 28.
Both functionals are tested for the molecules but not exten- sively tested for transition metals.
It has been observed that both functionals moderately improve the TPSS performance for 3d and 4d transition metals.
Whereas, for 5d transition metals, the TPSS and its different modiﬁed versions show quite similar performance.
It is noticeable that as the d-band ﬁlling increases, both the modTPSS and oTPSS enhance the inter-atomic distance.
This fact actually improves the perfor- mances of modTPSS and oTPSS compared to TPSS for several cases.
Concerning the performance of M06L, it underestimates the inter-atomic distances for 3d transition metal elements.
Whereas, overestimates the same for 4d and 5d.
The com- paratively large deviation obtained with the M06L functional with respect to other meta-GGA functionals for 4d and 5d transition metals originates from the deterioration of the func- tional from the L(S)DA in the uniform density limit.
However, a recently revised version of the M06L (revM06L)31 is pro- posedtoimprove itsperformancesforsolids.
BeyondtheTPSS and revTPSS, a new kind of functionality has been proposed by Ruzsinszky et al.26 by removing the order of the limit problem of the revTPSS functional which is known as the regTPSS functional.
However, unlike revTPSS, the regTPSS correlation is not one electron self-interaction free.
Still the regTPSS performs quite similarly as revTPSS for 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals.
The slight difference in the performance of revTPSS and regTPSS originates from the elimination of the order of limit anomaly and change in the correlation functional.
On the next level of approximations, the meta-GGA made simple functionals (MS0, MS1, and MS2)23,24 are proposed from the same understanding as regTPSS, i.e., by removing the order-of-limit problem and making the functional form simple.
The MAE corresponding to the “MS” functionals for 3d, 4d, and 5d metals is as follows: MS0 > MS1 > MS2.
This can be attributed to the behavior of the exchange enhance- ment factor of MS0, MS1, and MS2 in the s < 1 region, wheresisthereduceddensitygradient.
Theexchangeenhance- ment factor of MS2 is less steep than the exchange enhance- ment factor of MS0 and MS1 functionals for s < 1.23,24 The164703-4 Jana, Sharma, and Samal J. Chem.

Now, we consider the performance of the two recently pro- posed functionals, SCAN and TM (TMTPSS and TM).
The performance of the SCAN is quite disappointing for 3d transi- tion metals.
The MAE of the SCAN functional indicates that it performs better than MS0 but less accurate than MS1 and MS2.
Now, concerning TMTPSS and TM functionals, both are less accurate than TPSS, modTPSS, and oTPSS in predicting the inter-atomic distances of 3d transition metals.
Concerning the 4d and 5d transition metals, the SCAN and TM function- als perform almost equivalently.
In all these cases, the better FIG. 1.
Shown is the percentage deviation in inter-atomic distances obtained using different exchange-correlation functionals presented in Table I.
The scale of the Y-axis is adjusted for the better view of the errors.164703-6 Jana, Sharma, and Samal J. Chem.
Phys. 149, 164703 (2018) performance of the TM functional than TMTPSS originates from the change in the correlation energy functional of the TM functional.30 Now, we discuss the performance of different function- als in predicting the inter-atomic distances of the alkali metals which includes elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs.
We separately discuss these metals because different kinds of interactions affect the bonding of these metals.
Though they are considered as prototype metals, a sizable contribution from the semi-core p and s states originates van der Waals bonding53,65 which affects the lattice constants or equilibrium shortest distances.
A sizable error in equilibrium shortest distances is observed for the PBE functional.
Overall, the PBE functional overesti- mates the equilibrium shortest distances for the alkali metals.
The PBEsol improves the performance and yields the least MAE for the alkali metals.
Regarding the performance of the meta-GGA, all functionals overestimate the equilibrium dis- tances except the TMTPSS and TM functionals.
The reason of the improvement of the inter-atomic distances for the alkali metals can be understood as the inclusion of the intermedi- ate van der Waals interaction originating from the oscillation of the exchange hole (or the functional).42 Nevertheless, the M06L also includes the intermediate van der Waals interac- tion, but the lack of the appropriate slowly varying density correction makes the functional not suitable for the solid-state physics.
Unlike alkali metals, a reasonably good performance is observed using the PBE functional for the alkaline-earth metals.
However, the PBEsol underestimates the equilibrium shortest distances.
Within meta-GGA functionals, TPSS and MS2 perform quite well.
A sizable underestimation in the equi- librium shortest distances is observed using the M06L func- tional.
MS0 and MS1 overestimate the shortest inter-atomic distances, whereas the overestimation percentage is compar- atively inadequate for the SCAN functional.
The oTPSS and modTPSS tend to similar performance as TPSS.
The regTPSS performs almost equivalently as revTPSS.
In this case, both the TMTPSS and TM functionals underestimate the short- est distances.
But, the TMTPSS results are quite close to the experimental shortest distances.
However, we observe most impressive performance with the MS2 and SCAN functionals.
Both MS2 and SCAN functionals agree quite well with the experimental values compared to the most recent TMTPSS and TM functionals.
Due to the complicated structures of Mn, La, and Hg, we separate out these elements from others.
Regarding the per- formance of PBE, it massively overestimates the equilibrium shortest distances for all these metals.
Reasonably good per- formance is observed using PBEsol.
For meta-GGA, all per- form equivalently to predict the equilibrium shortest distances except M06L. M06L overestimates the shortest distances in a sizable order, whereas the MS0 and MS1 perform quite well compared to other meta-GGAs.
The MS2 and SCAN also produce the same amount of error in this case.
Here, we obtain the least MAE with the MS0 and MS1 function- als.
TM functional is the second best after MS0 and MS1 with MAE of 2.7 pm.
In this case also, the performance of the TM functional is better compared to that of the SCAN functional.
B. Bulk moduli It is well known that determining the bulk modulus for the transition metals49 poses a great challenge.
In Table II, we list the experimental values along with all the XC functional values.
The arrangement of Table II is the same as Table I.
The 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal elements are presented on the top of Table II.
Following this, alkali metals, alkaline earth, and other transition metals (Mn, La, and Hg) are given.
In Fig. 2, we plot the percentage deviation of all the metals con- sidered in our study.
It is noteworthy to mention that like lattice constants, there are no simple explanations of the functional behavior regarding the bulk moduli of the transition metals.
The general trends that we have observed in the case of the inter-atomic distances seem to be unsatisﬁed in the case of bulk moduli.
We start with the performance of the PBE functional for the 3d transition metals.
The PBE functional works well for the 3d transition metals and produces the least MAE.
How- ever , the PBEsol functional shows more deviation from the experimental values.
Regarding the meta-GGA, all functionals overestimate the bulk moduli and it is more intense as the d ﬁll- ing increases.
We observe that the modTPSS and oTPSS show improved performance over TPSS.
This is due to the improve- ment in the inter-atomic distances in modTPSS and oTPSS.
The regTPSS and revTPSS perform quite similarly except for few metals.
Like inter-atomic distances, the revTPSS follows the similar trends of PBEsol.
The explanation is the same as discussed earlier for the inter-atomic distances.
Regarding the meta-GGA made simple functionals and advanced meta-GGA like SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM functionals, the TM functional deviates quite comprehensively from the experimental val- ues.
The deviation tendency is more enhanced as the d ﬁlling increases.
However, the modTPSS reports being least MAE among the meta-GGA functionals.
A similar trend in the bulk moduli of 4d and 5d transi- tion metals is also observed for all the functionals.
The PBE and M06L underestimate the bulk moduli for all 4d tran- sition metals except Mo for PBE and Y for M06L. Other functionals overestimate the bulk moduli for the transition metals.
For 4d transition metals, the TPSS, oTPSS, modTPSS SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM perform better compared to the PBE functional, while the oTPSS shows minimum MAE com- pared to the other meta-GGA.
For 5d transition metals, the TPSS reports least MAE, whereas SCAN deviates more from experimental values.
The alkali metals are considered as a “soft-matter” due to the smaller extent of their bulk moduli.
All functionals perform reasonably good in the case of alkali metals.
Interestingly, in this case, both the TMTPSS and TM functionals improve the performance compared to the results of the 3d, 4d, and 5d counterpart.
The explanation of the improved performance of the TM based functionals is the same as given in the case of shortest distances.
The same accuracy for the TMTPSS and TM functionals is also observed for the alkaline earth metals.
The bulk moduli of Mn, La, and Hg are problematic within(mostof)thedensityfunctionals.
Theexperimentalbulk modulus of Mn is 90.4 GaP, whereas all functionals show164703-7 Jana, Sharma, and Samal J. Chem.

The bulk modulus of La is predicted fairlywellwithinallfunctionals,butoverestimationandunder- estimation in values are observed for Hg.
The bulk modulus of Hg obtained from revTPSS, regTPSS, MS0, MS2, and TMTPSS shows good agreement with the experimental val- ues.
The M06L underestimates the bulk modulus of Hg, and the same amount of overestimation is observed for the TM functional.
C. Cohesive energies Predicting the cohesive energies of transition metals also poses a great challenge because of the “strong” correlation nature.53 Table III presents the performance of all the function- als along with the experimental values.

Fixed lattice constant cohesive energies (in eV/atom) are computed for different solid structures using PBE, PBEsol, TPSS, modTPSS, oTPSS, revTPSS, regTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM functionals.
All the ﬁnite temperature corrected experimental values are collected from Refs. 49 and 53.
For elements Mn, La, and Hg, the temperature corrected values are not available and we report only the experimental values taken from Ref. 48.
The abbreviations of different crystal structures (CS) considered here are the same as Table I.

Here, the cohesive energies arecalculated at the ﬁxedlattice constantsof thecorresponding functional.
We start by discussing the performance of the PBE func- tional.
The PBE functional predicts the cohesive energies of 3d and 5d transition metals quite comprehensively and reports the least MAE.
But for 4d transition metals, the PBE functional overall underestimates the cohesive energies.
It has been observed that the overall tendency of the PBE functional for the 3d transition metals is different than the 4d and 5d transition metals.
This is due to the fact that PBE overbindsthe3d transitionmetals.
RegardingthePBEsolfunc- tional, it overestimates the cohesive energies compared to the PBE.
It is obvious because the PBE is a much better functional FIG.
3. Shown is the percentage deviation in cohesive energies obtained using different exchange-correlation functionals presented in Table III.
The scale of the Y-axis is adjusted for the better view of the errors.164703-11 Jana, Sharma, and Samal J. Chem.
Phys. 149, 164703 (2018) compared to PBEsol in predicting the atomization energy.
Therefore, the overestimation in the atomic energies reﬂects in the cohesive energies of the PBEsol functional.
Concerning the meta-GGA functionals, all functionals overestimate the cohesive energies for the 3d transition met- als.
In this regard, the modTPSS functional predicts the least MAE among the meta-GGAs.
The modTPSS performs even better compared to the TPSS functional for 3d transition met- als, while oTPSS performs the same as TPSS for all 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals.
Quite reasonably, in this case also, the revTPSS performs similarly as PBEsol and shows the similar tendency for the cohesive energies of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals.
The TPSS performs better than revTPSS because it is proposed on the basis of the PBE functional.
The M06L overestimates the cohesive energies of all the 3d transition metals (except Cu) due to the smaller extent of inter- atomic distances.
We observe quite similar performance for regTPSS and revTPSS functionals in this case.
The moderate difference in the results of regTPSS and revTPSS arises from the difference in the lattice constants of the two function- als.26 We obtain almost equivalent performance for MS0, MS1, and MS2 functionals.
Overall, for 3d and 5d transition metals, “MS” functionals overestimate the cohesive energies, whereas for 4d transition metals, underestimation is observed.
Considering the performance of the most recent meta-GGA functionals, SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM, the TM based func- tionals deviate more than the SCAN functional does.
However, the SCAN functional performs similarly as “MS” function- als.
This tendency of overestimating the cohesive energies of all the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals with the “TM” functional is more evident as the d-band ﬁlling increases.
Physically, this can be understood from the construction point of view of the TM functional.
The TM functional is pro- posed by interpolating between the compact density [density matrix expansion (DME) dominates] and slowly varying den- sity limit.30 The enhancement factor obtained from the density matrix expansion (DME) dominates when the system becomes one electron-like.
On the other hand, as the d-band ﬁlling increases, the overlap of the closed shells increases, which implies z ≈0 [where z is the meta-GGA ingredient which is deﬁned as the ration of von Weizs¨acker kinetic energy den- sity (τW) and KS kinetic energy density (τ) as z = τW τ ].78 Therefore, the slowly varying density correction (sc) in the TM functional dominates, which affects the atomic energies and worsens its performance for the cohesive energies.
In the TM functional, the DME enhancement factor actually takes part in the improvement of atomization energies.
This case is modiﬁed for the alkali metals, where the outermost orbital is one electron-like.
Regardingthealkalimetals,allfunctionals(exceptM06L) perform reasonably well.
The deviation of the M06L is due to the same reason as discussed earlier in the case of inter- atomic distances and bulk moduli.
A noticeable improvement in the performance of the TM based functionals is observed in this case.
For alkaline-earth metals also, all perform quite well except M06L. PBE, modTPSS, and MS1 perform quite remarkably in this regard.
The PBE and modTPSS show an opposite trend.
PBE shows a small degree of underestima- tion (except Ca), whereas modTPSS shows a similar extent of overestimation.
The overestimation tendency of TPSS is modiﬁed by modTPSS, while oTPSS shows equivalent per- formance as TPSS.
In this case, we also observe very similar behavior in the performance of PBEsol and revTPSS func- tionals.
Whereas, the regTPSS and revTPSS deviate slightly from each other.
Considering the “MS” functionals, the MS1 performs quite well, while MS2 overestimates the cohesive energies.
The behavior of MS2 and SCAN is equivalent, and both overestimate the cohesive energies by a similar amount.
The equivalent tendency in the cohesive ener- gies in MS2 and SCAN reﬂects from their inter-atomic distance performance.
However, we observe a noticeable amount of overestimation in the performance of TMTPSS and TM functionals.
In this regard, the performance of the SCAN functional is quite better compared to the TM based functionals.
ConcerningthecohesiveenergyofMn,itislargelyoveres- timated within all the GGA and meta-GGA functionals except MS0, MS1, and SCAN.
Overall, the M06L functional predicts the best MAE for all other transition metal elements.
Like most of the transition metals in this case also, the TM func- tional enhances the error of TMTPSS.
This is because of the difference in the atomic energies of TM and TMTPSS func- tionals.
Unlike other transition metals, in this case, we observe that the revTPSS and PBEsol results deviate from each other, while the modTPSS, oTPSS, and regTPSS perform similar to the base functionals. IV.
CHALLENGES OF ADVANCED META-GGA FUNCTIONALS Due to the open-shell systems, the transition metals are always difﬁcult cases within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, which is a ground state theory.41 Besides, the GGA functionals include the spurious self-interaction error.
This self-interaction error has been removed partially by the higher rungs of Jacob’s ladder.
The meta-GGA functionals are pro- posed by eliminating the one or two electron self-interaction in its correlating part.
Though the meta-GGA functionals per- form quite accurately for the main-group metals but remain difﬁcult for the transition metals.
Especially, the bulk mod- uli and cohesive energies remain a challenge for the meta- GGA functionals.
To encapsulate the overall performance of the functional, we present the overall statistical analysis and ranking of each functional in Table IV.
In Fig. 4, we also present the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the individual functional excluding the Mn, La, and Hg results.
Based on these analyses, it is indicative that simultaneously predicting both the structural and energetic properties of the transition metals with GGA and meta-GGA functionals poses a great challenge.
Though the SCAN and TM functionals are considered as one of the most advanced functionals, these functionals do not show improved performances over the PBE functional for the bulk moduli and cohesive energies.
Only, in the case of alkali metals, the advanced meta-GGA functionals show promising performance.
It is noteworthy that the SCAN, M06L, and TM functionals capture mid-range vdW interac- tions, which accounts for improved performance for some systems but remains difﬁcult for others.
Especially, for alkali164703-12 Jana, Sharma, and Samal J. Chem.

In the present study, we do not include any long-range corrected vdW interactions in our calculations.
The inclusion of the long-range corrected vdW interactions may improve the functional performance because of the proper account for the long-range electron cor- relation effect.
The problem with the M06L is that it does not recover the uniform density limit.
Particularly, M06L is not a suitable functional for the alkali and alkaline-earth metals in all three considered cases.
Recently, an improved version of the M06L is proposed to improve the solid-state performances.31 Concerning the most advanced TM based functionals, it has been observed in our present study that the TPSS correlation with TM exchange often performs better compared to TM cor- relation for cohesive energies.
This is because of the fact that TPSS correlation with TM exchange is better in predicting the atomization energies.42 The TM functional is very accu- rate for inter-atomic distances or lattice constants.
Considering other meta-GGA functionals, the revTPSS shows PBEsol-like tendency.
The modTPSS and oTPSS improve the accuracy of TPSS in several cases, whereas the regTPSS performs moder- ately better compared to revTPSS in predicting the overall cohesive energies.
All the “MS” functionals perform simi- larly for all the properties under investigation in the present study.
Regarding the overall performances of meta-GGA functionals, the TM functional is accurate in predicting the FIG.

V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we assess the performance of the recently proposed meta-GGA density functionals along with the pop- ularly used GGA based functionals for the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
The present work is arranged by addressing the performance of the 3d, 4d, 5d transition met- als, alkali, alkaline-earth metals, and other transition met- als.
Due to the complicated structure of Mn, La, and Hg, we discuss these three materials separately.
Special atten- tion has been paid to the performance on the recently pro- posed SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM functionals.
Based on these analyses, benchmark calculations and the level of deﬁcien- cies persisting with all the functionals, one can conclude the following: (i) For the equilibrium distances of the 3d transition met- als, PBE results are reasonably better compared to all other GGA and meta-GGA functionals.
For 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals, the PBE results are too large except for few cases.
The PBEsol and revTPSS follow essentially the identical results.
The modiﬁed version of TPSS, i.e., oTPSS and modTPSS, performs better compared to its TPSS coun- terpart, whereas the regTPSS performs almost similarly as revTPSS.
The largest error is obtained from the M06L functional.
For alkali and alkaline-earth metals, it gives the most error.
The performance of MS0 and MS1 is identical.
Whereas, MS2 and SCAN closely follow each other in most of the cases.
We obtain the best performance with the TM functional.
The TM functional performs even better than the SCAN in most of the cases except alkaline-earth metals.
We also noticed that the performance of TMTPSS is quite close to that of the TM functional for 3d transition metals.
(ii) Taking into consideration the bulk moduli, the PBE and modTPSSfunctionalsperformbettercomparedtoother GGAandmeta-GGAfunctionalsineverycase.
Overall, PBE underestimates the bulk moduli of 4d transition metals, 5d transition metals, alkali metals, and alkaline- earth metals.
For 3d metals, the PBE functional over- estimates the results.
The overestimation tendency of TPSS is reduced comprehensively by modTPSS due to the effect of the exchange enhancement factor.
The bulk moduli of Mn remain a difﬁcult case for all the GGA and meta-GGA functionals.
Overall, the revTPSS follows very closely the PBEsol results.
The perfor- mance of all other meta-GGA varies noticeably from the PBE results.
Like inter-atomic distances of alkali and alkaline-earth metals, in this case also, the M06L gives the most error.
Concerning the performance of TMTPSS and TM functional performance, TMTPSS is only slightly better than SCAN for the MAE and MAPE.
Whereas, SCAN performs better than TM.
(iii) In predicting the cohesive energies of all the metals, PBE outperforms all other functionals considered here.
Only for the alkali metals, the PBE results deviate more from the experimental values.
Within meta-GGA, the modTPSS results in the least total mean absolute error.
The revTPSS closely follows the PBEsol in all the cases.
In this case also, we observe that the M06L gives the most error for the alkali and alkaline-earth metals.
Overall consideration shows that the TM pre- dicts the largest mean absolute error.
Though in the case of the alkali metals, the TMTPSS and TM function- als perform quite well compared to other cases.
But, overall consideration shows that both the functionals overestimate the cohesive energies.
Overall, compari- son of SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM shows that the SCAN functional performs better compared to the TMTPSS and TM functional in the estimation of the cohesive energies.
To conclude, both the structural properties and energetic performance remain a challenge within the most advanced meta-GGA functionals like SCAN and TM.
Though the recently developed TM functional shows better accuracy for the lattice constants or inter-atomic distances, it is not a prefer- able candidate for the bulk moduli and cohesive energies of the transition metals.
The accuracy of the TM functional is due to the fact that it correctly recovers the fourth-order gradient expansion.
It is also shown that the TM functional with TPSS and TM correlation performs differently for the all the proper- ties.
This effect in the correlation energy can be eliminated by modifyingthecorrelationfunctionalformasitwasdoneinsev- eral modiﬁcations based on the TPSS functional.
Interestingly, the TM includes some intermediate van der Waals interac- tions due to the de-enhancement of the exchange functional part which enables it to capture the van der Waals bonding nature originating in several transition and alkali metals.
In our future demonstration, we will consider the long-range van der Waals interaction with these functionals to enhance the per- formance.
It will also be interesting to incorporate the exact constraint into the functional form of the TM functional which was designed mainly from the exact constraint of the exchange hole.
