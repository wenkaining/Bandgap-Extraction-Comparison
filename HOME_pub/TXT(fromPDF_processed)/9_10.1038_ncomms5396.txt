Zhang4,5, Ho Nyung Lee2 & Jian Shen1,3 Organic spintronic devices have been appealing because of the long spin lifetime of the charge carriers in the organic materials and their low cost, ﬂexibility and chemical diversity.
In previous studies, the control of resistance of organic spin valves is generally achieved by the alignment of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, generating magnetoresistance.
Here we employ a new knob to tune the resistance of organic spin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between the ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer: the magnetoresistance of the spin valve depends strongly on the history of the bias voltage, which is correlated with the polarization of the ferroelectric layer; the magnetoresistance even changes sign when the electric polarization of the ferroelectric layer is reversed.
These ﬁndings enable active control of resistance using both electric and magnetic ﬁelds, opening up possibility for multi-state organic spin valves.

S ince the pioneering work by Dediu et al.1 and Xiong et al.2, many of the follow-up studies have focused on achieving high magnetoresistance (MR) in organic spin valves (OSVs) and uncovering the underlying transport mechanisms3–11.
It has been generally acknowledged that the interfaces between the organic layer and the ferromagnetic electrodes play a critical role in determining the actual spin-dependent transport mechanism12–15.
Barraud et al.16 studied the spin transport of an OSV in which the thin organic layer serves as a tunnelling barrier as opposed to a diffusive spacer.
A spin transport model describing the role of interfacial spin-dependent metal/organic hybridization on the amplitude and sign of the MR was put forward16,17.
Recently, Schulz et al.18 observed a reversal of the spin polarization of extracted charge carriers by introducing a thin interfacial permanent dipolar layer (LiF).
This work indicates that the local electric dipole moment at the interface is important for MR, although in such a device the added dipolar layer plays only a passive role in terms of controlling MR.
In the following, we employ a ferroelectric (FE) thin interfacial layer between the organic semiconductor and the ferromagnetic electrode in OSV to achieve active control of MR.
The material of choice for the FE layer is PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT), which has a large polarization (B80 mC cm  2)19.
The PZT layer can induce strong interfacial dipoles and built-in electric ﬁeld between the organic spacer layer and the ferromagnetic electrode.
The interfacial dipole is switchable by external electric ﬁeld, potentially allowing the control of the spin polarization of injected carriers in organic spintronics.
We show that the resistance can be controlled by not only the spin alignment of the two ferromagnetic electrodes3, but also by the electric polarization of the PZT layer.
The sign of MR changes when electric polarization of the PZT layer is reversed.
This new tunability can be understood in terms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the FE layer.
Results Device structure and characterizations of the PZT ﬁlms.
Our fabricated OSVs consist a 65-nm Alq3 (tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum) layer sandwiched between a 5-nm-thick PZT layer epitaxially grown on a 30-nm-thick La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) ﬁlm-buffered SrTiO3 (STO) substrate, and a 10-nm-thick (nominal thickness) cobalt layer with gold capping.
In this LSMO/PZT/Alq3/Co junction (FE-OSV), Co and LSMO serve as the top and bottom magnetic electrodes, respectively.
The device structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1a.
As discussed in the following, such kind of devices exhibit striking tunability, that is, both the amplitude and sign of MR are tunable due to the pre- sence of the FE PZT.
After epitaxial growth of PZT on LSMO/STO, the PZT layer has a smooth surface with atomically ﬂat terraces, as character- ized by atomic force microscopy shown in Fig. 1b.
This provides an ideal base for preparing a well-deﬁned Alq3/PZT interface.
The purpose of introducing the 5-nm-thick-PZT is to tune the energy level alignment between the Alq3 and LSMO layers because the polarization in PZT is switchable by applying an electric ﬁeld.
Therefore, the polarization reversal of the PZT is crucial.
Here we have characterized the polarization reversal of the PZT ﬁlms used in the FE-OSV devices with piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM).
Figure 1c shows a PFM image of the PZT ﬁlm with a part of the ﬁlm poled by a conducting tip with ±2.5 V relative to the LSMO bottom electrode.
It shows that the polarization of the as- grown ﬁlms is pointing ‘up’, and a clear reversal of polarization between ‘up’ and ‘down’ states can be created by sign reversal of the applied voltage.
Figure 1d shows the voltage dependence of the polarization.
It is clear that the polarization of the PZT ﬁlm (5 nm in thickness) starts to switch to the ‘down’ state when the voltage of the scanning probe exceeds 0.8 V.
The polarization reversal of the PZT in the FE-OSV is characterized by the measurements of the hysteretic polarization-voltage dependence.
As shown in Fig. 1e, with the Alq3/Co/Au layers on top of PZT, the coercive voltage is B2 V. Figure 1f shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image for the cross-section of the FE- OSV.
No signiﬁcant diffusion of Co atoms into the Alq3 layer is observed (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1).
Hysteretic behaviour of the MR.
It has been known that MR depends sensitively on the measuring voltage (VMR).

All rights reserved.studies indicated that MR of LSMO/Alq3/Co junctions (LSMO- OSV) increases with decreasing VMR, reaching a maximum when VMR is close to zero2,16.
For our FE-OSV junctions, its MR depends not only on VMR, but also on the history of the voltage applied, giving rise to a strong hysteretic behaviour.
We characterize this hysteretic behaviour by measuring MR (VMR) proﬁle after applying a ramping voltage (VMAX) that is larger than VMR (see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 2 for the detailed measurement protocol).
As shown in Fig. 2, for a FE-OSV containing an as-grown PZT layer, the MR (at T ¼ 11 K) is always negative and is the largest when VMR is near zero, which is similar to numerous previous studies on LSMO-OSV2,4–6,8–11.
The different features in the FE-OSV are: (1) the MR(VMR) proﬁle is strongly affected by the initial voltage (VMAX) and (2) a positive (negative) VMAX leads to a negative (positive) shift of the MR(VMR) proﬁle along the VMR axis (Fig. 2d,e).
This shift (DV) is closely tied to the hysteretic behaviour of the PZT layer (so-called minor loops, see Fig. 1e) and increases with increasing VMAX, as shown in Fig. 2f.
The switching ﬁelds, MR uncertainty and MR loops reproducibility in FE-OSVs are shown in Supplementary Figs 3–5 and Supplementary Notes 3 and 4, respectively.
The hysteretic behaviour of the MR was not observed in OSVs without the FE layer, including a conventional LSMO/Alq3/Co OSV (LSMO-OSV) and a LSMO/STO/Alq3/Co OSV (STO-OSV) in which the 5-nm PZT is replaced by 5-nm STO (see Supplementary Figs 6 and 7, and Supplementary Note 5 for detailed MR loops and MR (VMR) proﬁles).
This indicates that the hysteretic behaviour of the MR in FE-OSV is tied to the presence of PZT.
The distinctly different behaviour between the FE-OSV and the PZT-free OSVs (LSMO-OSV and STO-OSV) also allow us to exclude the possibility of resistive bistability mechanism caused by the existence of the trap states or current conduct path inside the Alq3 layer20,21, as otherwise similar MR behaviour should be observed in both types of devices.
We have also performed measurements on a LSMO/PZT/Co magnetic tunnel junction (FE-MTJ, see Supplementary Fig. 8).

The comparison of the MR (VMR) proﬁles of the FE-OSV and the FE-MTJ suggests that the effective voltage generated by the dipole of the PZT (instead of the interfacial bonding) is responsible for the hysteretic behaviour of the MR in the FE-OSV.
The FE-MTJ does not show hysteretic behaviour of MR, because no direct dipole exists on the surface of the PZT due to the screening effect from the two metal electrodes in direct contact with the PZT layer.
A schematic model is illustrated in Fig. 3 to explain this hysteretic behaviour of MR in the FE-OSV.
When a VMAX is applied to the junction, the polarization of the PZT gets modiﬁed.
Owing to the dipole moment created by the electric polarization of PZT, the effective voltage Veff applied on the Alq3 layer equals VMR þ D, where D is the vacuum level shift caused by the remnant dipole moment of PZT.
When a positive (negative) VMAX is applied, D becomes larger (smaller), which explains why the MR (VMR) proﬁle can be shifted by VMAX.
Switch of the MR sign.
Remarkably, a reversal of the polarization of the PZT layer leads to a sign change of the MR in the FE-OSV.
After measuring the MR and MR (VMR) proﬁle (Fig. 4a–c) for the FE-OSV device B (PZT layer in the as-grown state), we measured polarization-voltage dependence up to ±5 V.
The measurement ended at  5.0 V to pole the PZT to the ‘down’ state.
The MR measurements of the FE-OSV device after this treatment are shown in Fig. 4d,e,g,h.
The shape of the MR (VMR) proﬁle changes dramatically, as shown in Fig. 4i.
In particular, the sign of the MR changes from negative (Fig. 4a,b) to positive (Fig. 4d,g,h) for a certain range of VMR.
A close correlation between the polarization of PZT and the sign of the MR can be identiﬁed by comparing the hysteretic behaviour of the MR (VMR) proﬁle and the possible minor polarization-voltage loop of the PZT, as illu- strated in Fig. 4f, that is, when the polarization of PZT is negative enough (more ‘down’ state), the MR becomes positive.
The physical origin of MR sign of the LSMO/Alq3/Co junctions has been studied previously by Barraud et al. using nanoindentation-based devices.
It was argued that ﬁrst, the spin polarization alignment P* at the Co/Alq3 interface is positive when electrons move from Co to Alq3, that is, P*(Alq3-Co)40 where the arrow indicates the direction of the electric current4,24; second, the density of states for Alq3 at the Alq3/LSMO interface is spin polarized due to the coupling between the two materials, causing P*(LSMO-Alq3)o0 when the Alq3 serves as a diffusive spacer.
Following these arguments, Barraud et al.16 concluded that the sign of MR at small measurement voltages is determined by the sign of the product of P*(Alq3-Co) and P*(LSMO- Alq3); the result is negative.

P*(Alq3-Co)40 can be assumed similarly; the polarization alignment P* between LSMO and Alq3 is not changed by inserting a thin layer (5 nm) of as-grown PZT or STO, but can be changed by poling the PZT layer, according to the behaviour of the observed MR.
This novel feature in FE-OSV must be due to the more complex LSMO/PZT-Alq3 interface.
We propose the following model based on the relative energy level alignment between Alq3 and LSMO to understand the switching of MR sign in FE-OSV.
Here we consider mainly the hole transport, because for Alq3 the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and Fermi levels of the two metallic LSMO and Co electrodes are much smaller than that between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the Fermi levels2,18,25.
As shown in Fig. 5a, when the polarization of the PZT layer is pointing ‘up’ (the as-grown state) or zero (the same case as for STO), the hole injection from the LSMO electrode for positive VMR is from the Fermi level (which lies in the spin majority band) of LSMO to the HOMO of Alq3, which is the same as in the LSMO-OSV.
Therefore, P*(LSMO/PZT-Alq3)o0, corresponding to a negative MR considering P*(Alq3-Co)40 as discussed above2,4.
When the polarization of the PZT layer is pointing ‘down’, the HOMO of A1q3 is shifted up due to the dipole moment of PZT.
Therefore, another state of the LSMO with opposite spin polarization may be accessible (Fig. 5b).
Hence, P*(LSMO/PZT-Alq3) changes the sign and becomes positive, corresponding to a reversed, positive MR.
Our proposed model relies on two key assumptions: (1) the dipole moment of the PZT layer shifts the Alq3 HOMO level and (2) the shift of the Alq3 HOMO level results in a shift of the initial state of LSMO for the hole injection between energy band of opposite spin polarizations.
The ﬁrst assumption was used by Schultz et al.18 to explain the MR sign reversal in a FeCo/Alq3/ LiF/NiFe junction by proposing a shift of the HOMO of Alq3 due to the dipole moment of LiF layer.
The second assumption can be justiﬁed by the half metallicity of LSMO.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the conduction band of LSMO splits into spin majority and minority bands due to the exchange interaction, causing half metallicity because the Fermi level lies within the fully polarized spin majority band26–28.
Therefore, when the HOMO of Alq3 is shifted up due to the reversal of dipole moment of PZT, the initial state of LSMO for hole injection may change to spin minority band with opposite spin polarization.
Note that this reversed dipole moment of PZT needs to be large enough to shift the HOMO level of Alq3 to ‘reach’ the spin minority band of LSMO and obtain reversed positive MR values.
Otherwise, only negative MR values will be observed, as shown in Fig. 4f (also see Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Note 6).
Besides changing the energy level alignments, switching the electric polarization of the FE layer may also modify the coupling between the FE layer and the magnetic electrode, depending on the detailed electronic structure of the electrode and the nature of the electric polarization of the FE material29–31.
These effects may also change the spin polarization at the interface between the FE material and the metal electrode22,23,31.
However, both the magnetic structure of the LSMO and the spin polarization of the PZT are not expected to be affected very much by the electric polarization of the PZT, because of the robust magnetic properties of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 with given composition (far from the metal-insulator phase boundary) and the large distance between the Mn site from LSMO and Ti sites from PZT at the interface22,23,30,31.
Another possible scenario involves the change of carrier type when the energy level alignment between LSMO and Alq3 is changed: the carriers take the path of the HOMO (lowest occupied molecular orbital),that is, hole (electron) transport in Alq3 when the energy levels of Alq3 is shifted ‘down’ (‘up’) due to the ‘up’ (‘down’) polarization of the PZT layer.
This, however, contradicts our experimental observations because in the FE-OSV with the as-grown (‘up’ polarization) PZT, the MR is negative, the same as that in the STO-OSV or LSMO-OSV without any interfacial layers, suggesting that the carrier type in FE-OSV is most probably holes instead of electrons18,25, as in the STO-OSV or LSMO-OSV.
Discussion The active control of the energy level alignment between the electrodes and the organic material, manifested here in the active control of the MR, not only carries promises for multistate control of organic spin-valve devices, but will also impact other organic electronic devices, in particular those applied in photovoltaics and solid-state lighting.
Speciﬁcally, the charge carrier injection efﬁciency of the organic light emitting diode is determined by the relative alignment between the Fermi energy of the electrode and the energy levels of the organic material32.
The charge collection efﬁciency in an organic photovoltaic device also depends on the alignment of the energy levels of the acceptor organic material and the electrode33.
Therefore, the realization of the active control of the level alignment using an FE interfacial layer demonstrated in this letter may also lead to successful optimization of other organic electronic devices by tailoring the energy landscape of the comprising materials using a tunable interfacial layer.
