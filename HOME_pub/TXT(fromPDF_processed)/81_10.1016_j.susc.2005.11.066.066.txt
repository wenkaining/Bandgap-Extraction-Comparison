Introduction Organic materials are attractive for electronic industry, because they promise large versatility based on organic chemistry, low price based on very common elements used as building blocks and interesting mechanical properties.
There is quite a vigorous research activity in organic mate- rials for electrical applications – from insulators trough semiconductors to conductors and even superconductors.
Here we are concerned with metal phthalocyanines (MPc).
Electronic structure calculations [1] and recent experimental observation of the possibility to dope these materials by adding electrons [2] resembles somewhat the situation of fullerenes.
In our previous paper we speculated about possible phase diagrams for electron doped MgPc [3].
While these possibilities are under active experimental considerations, we noticed that for the commonest experi- mental diagnostic, namely Raman scattering there is no reference calculation of either modes nor Raman intensities (with exception of ZnPc [14]).
In this paper we focused our interest on the vibrational properties of MgPc, which we wish to study ab-initio.
While our ﬁnal aim will be to com- pute spectra of doped and undoped molecules, this work will be restricted to neutral undoped MgPc, which has not been studied so far.
2. Technical details All our calculations were done using the PWscf software package [4], which is a plane-wave basis set DFT imple- mentation.
We used the LDA approximation with Slater approximation for exchange and Perdew–Zunger functional for correlations eﬀects.
In order to lower the plane-wave energy cut-oﬀwe used the non-local RRKJ3 ul- tra-soft pseudopotentials [5].
The kinetic energy cut-oﬀwas 35 Ry for the wave functions basis set and 280 Ry for the charge density basis set.
The plane-wave basis set assumed periodic boundary conditions.
The unit cell had dimensions 21 · 21 · 11 A˚ , therefore including enough vacuum to rep- resent the isolated molecule.
By energy optimization we found the equilibrium molec- ular structure with structural parameters as in Table 1.
The molecule has D4h symmetry group and is planar.
The elec- tronic structure agrees well with former calculations of Liao et al. [1].
Some levels near the HOMO–LUMO gap are listed in the Table 2.
We calculated the vibrational spectra of neutral, un- doped MgPc by means of the density functional perturba- tion theory [6].
The dynamical matrix was calculated in Cartesian coordinates.
In the isolated molecule with N atoms there are 3N  6 genuine vibrations while 6 modes corresponds to translation–rotational degrees of freedom with zero frequency.
In reality due to periodic images of molecules there is a weak virtual interaction which can 0039-6028/$ - see front matter  2006 Elsevier B.V.

We eliminated these modes by transform- ing the dynamical matrix to internal coordinates and setting the corresponding dynamical matrix elements to zero.
We checked that after this procedure we obtained eigenvectors of correct symmetry.
Assignment of irreduc- ible representation to all eigenvectors was done by projec- tion on symmetry adapted bases of all linearly independent atomic displacement.
For N = 57 atoms there are 165 vibrations Cvib ¼ 14A1g þ 13A2g þ 14B1g þ 14B2 g þ 13Eg þ 6A1u þ 8A2u þ 7B1u þ 7B2u þ 28Eu where Eg and Eu are two–fold degenerated modes.
The calculated frequencies are summarized in Fig. 2.
The Raman intensity is related to the change of molec- ular polarizability due to the deformation introduced by the vibration.
We calculated the polarizability derivatives with respect to deformations in the static limit.
With each vibrational mode qi is associated a Raman tensor Ti given by T i lm ¼ dalm dqi ð1Þ Here l, m are Cartesian indices, alm is the polarizability ten- sor deﬁned as alm ¼ o2U oEloEm, U is the total energy and ~E an external electric ﬁeld.
Therefore one has to calculate third derivatives of total energy o3U oEloEmoxl.
The energy derivatives with respect to atomic displacements are forces acting on atomic nuclei, and are calculated via the Hellman– Feynman theorem.
We extracted the force dependence on electric ﬁeld by numerical diﬀerences.
Applied ﬁelds were ±1 · 103, ±2 · 103, ±4 · 103 a.u.
Details about appli- cation of electric ﬁeld within periodic boundary conditions are the same as in [7].
There are alternative methods for the Raman tensor calculation using linear response theory [8,9].
However numerical derivative method with ﬁnite ﬁeld is computationally less demanding for the present case, where moreover the implementation is very simple.
From the Raman tensor Eq. (1) we calculated for each mode the gas phase (angle averaged) Raman scattering cross section following [10,11] in the form: dri dX ¼ ð2pm0Þ4 c4 hðni þ 1Þ 8pmi 45a02 i þ 7c02 i 45 a0 i ¼ 1 3 ðT i xx þ T i yy þ T i zzÞ c02 i ¼ 1 2 fðT i xx  T i yyÞ2 þ ðT i xx  T i zzÞ2 þ ðT i yy  T i zzÞ2 þ 6½ðT i xyÞ2 þ ðT i xzÞ2 þ ðT i yzÞ2g ni ¼ exp hmi kT    1  1 ð2Þ m0 is frequency of incident light, ni is equilibrium occupa- tion number for the initial vibrational state i at the given temperature T. The a0 and c02 are isotropic and anisotropic parts of the Raman tensor.
Both are invariant under rotations.

Orientation of coordinate system is important for deﬁnition of the Raman tensors by Eq. (3).

The Raman tensor of a particular mode must belong to the same irreducible representation as that vibration mode.
In a coordinate system connected to the molecule as indi- cated on Fig. 1 all symmetric tensors of second rank are di- vided according to irreducible representations in the form: A1g : a 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 b 0 B @ 1 C A; B1g : c 0 0 0 c 0 0 0 0 0 B @ 1 C A; B2g : 0 d 0 d 0 0 0 0 0 0 B @ 1 C A; Eg : 0 0 e 0 0 f e f 0 0 B @ 1 C A ð3Þ Traceless irreducible representations possess only the anisotropic part, while the A1g mode has both parts.
Weights in front of a0 and c0 in formula 2 (45 and 7, respec- tively) can be changed by observation geometry, thus pro- viding a way to (partially) assign symmetry to vibration eigenmodes (see for example [11]).
We note that for the Eg representation it is possible to deﬁne a single indepen- dent parameter ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ e2 þ f 2 p because of the degeneracy and orthogonality of degenerated modes.
3. Results and discussion In Table 1 we give our LDA optimized structure of MgPc.
In comparison with data in [1,12] we see a reason- able agreement.
The diﬀerence can be attributed to diﬀer- ent density functional (GGA in [1]).
LDA is known to slightly overbind in covalent bonds.
Kohn–Sham orbitals energies (Table 2) are given relative to vacuum zero taken as the SCF electrostatic potential far from the molecule.

Frequencies are in cm1, Raman tensor components in atomic units (distance in Bohr radii a0, energy in Rydbergs, and electric ﬁeld units e/a0).

Vibrational spectra of various metal phthalocyanines were experimentally measured [13] by means of Raman spectroscopy.
In the case of ZnPc there is also a DFT cal- culation of the vibrational and Raman spectra [14].
In gen- eral the most intense peak was found to be in the interval 1500–1550 cm1 depending on the central atom.
Our calculated vibration spectrum of MgPc is on Fig. 2.
Above the frequency line for Raman active modes we write the corresponding non-zero component of Raman tensor as deﬁned by Eq. (3).
The simulated Raman spectrum according to formula 2 is shown on Fig. 3.
To simulate spectrum for each intensity and frequency we added Gauss- ian with the spread r = 5 cm1.
We considered the low temperature limit (ni = 0) and low incident light frequency limit.
Our most intense Raman scattering mode is at 1587 cm1 with symmetry B1g.
This is similar to ZnPc which is at 1516 cm1 with symmetry B1.
The results of the presented calculation should be com- pared with Raman data of MgPc, as soon as available.
It will also serve as a starting point for future work on the electron doped molecules [2].
