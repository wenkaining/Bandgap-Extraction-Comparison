PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 2, 043077 (2020) Quantum valence bond ice theory for proton-driven quantum spin-dipole liquids Masahiko G. Yamada 1,2,3,* and Yasuhiro Tada2,† 1Department of Materials Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka 560-8531, Japan 2Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa 277-8581, Japan 3Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA (Received 27 March 2019; revised 18 September 2020; accepted 21 September 2020; published 14 October 2020) We present a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid state, the quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL), in a hydrogen-bonded electron system, by combining a quantum proton ice and Anderson’s resonating valence bond spin liquid theory, motivated by the recent experimental discovery of a quantum spin liquid with proton ﬂuctuations in κ-H3(Cat-EDT-TTF)2 (a.k.a. H-Cat).
In our theory, an electron spin liquid and a proton dipole liquid are realized simultaneously in the ground state called quantum valence bond ice.
In this state, neither of them can be established independently of the other.
Analytical and numerical calculations reveal that this state has a large entanglement entropy between spins and dipoles, which is far beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
We also examine the stability of QSDL with respect to perturbations and discuss implications for experiments in H-Cat and its deuterated analog D-Cat. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043077 I. INTRODUCTION Hydrogen bonds occupy a unique position in condensed matter physics, where we can expect a huge quantum para- electricity due to its lightness.
Most hydrogen-bonded systems so far were treated within the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where we ignore quantum entanglement be- tween atomic motion and electronic states.
However, recently it was recognized that in many hydrogen-bonded materials the quantum nature of protons plays an essential role and even af- fects basic properties of the system [1–6].
Indeed, protons can tunnel quantum mechanically between two stable positions of the O-H · · · O bonding and furthermore the hydrogen bonds are subject to the ice rule due to the frustration in a wide range of systems, including ferroelectric KH2PO4 [4,7], hexagonal water ice [5,8], and molecular crystals [6,9,10].
Recently, a new member of hydrogen-bonded materials, purely organic κ-H3(Cat-EDT-TTF)2 (called H-Cat), was syn- thesized [11–19].
H-Cat has a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice structure of dimers with moderate interlayer coupling, and each layer is connected by hydrogen bonds which also form a triangular lattice.
Experimentally, protons are unfrozen down to the lowest temperature and the observed quantum paraelectricity can be attributed to proton tunneling [16].
In stark contrast to the other hydrogen-bonded materials, H-Cat is shown to be a dimer Mott insulator, where we can expect strong electron correlation.
Moreover, in H-Cat, spins delocalized over the π-conjugated orbital are also ﬂuctuating *myamada@mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp †tada@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

without any magnetic order below a temperature scale close to that of the quantum proton motion.
This implies that a quantum liquid state of unknown type is realized in H-Cat, where both protons and electrons are quantum mechani- cally disordered simultaneously and are strongly entangled with each other, which makes this material far beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
On the other hand, the deuterated counterpart D-Cat exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below 185 K, where protons and elec- trons together show a coupled charge order, indicating strong Coulomb interaction between them [11,13,16].
Thus, such a large isotope effect strongly suggests that the proton tunneling is responsible for the possible hybrid quantum liquid state in H-Cat.
However, it is unclear why proton and spin ﬂuctuations can coexist in a quantum liquid state.
The triangular lattice of H-Cat is a prototypical example of frustrated lattices and such a frustrated lattice can im- pose constraints on proton and spin conﬁgurations, leading to macroscopic degeneracy at a classical level.
Quantum ﬂuc- tuations could potentially realize a quantum liquid state out of the degenerate classical states as originally proposed in Anderson’s theory of the resonating valence bond (RVB) state [20–22].
The basic mechanism of realizing a quantum liquid was later employed in the theories of qunatum spin ice and water ice, where the RVB state is exactly realized by tuning a system into the exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point [21–26].
This observation would imply that both the electron spin liquid and the proton dipole liquid can be treated in a uniﬁed manner to describe a spin-dipole coupled quantum liquid.
In this paper, motivated by the experimental discovery of H-Cat, we present a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid state, the quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL), in hydrogen-bonded electron systems by combining the concepts of Anderson’s RVB state of electron spins and a quantum ice of protons.
Although a hybrid quantum spin liquid itself is discussed in 2643-1564/2020/2(4)/043077(8) 043077-1 Published by the American Physical SocietyMASAHIKO G. YAMADA AND YASUHIRO TADA PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 2, 043077 (2020) the literature [27–33], including spin-charge coupled purely electron systems without hydrogen bonds [34–38], its en- tangled nature has never been discussed in detail.
In our theory, the RVB state is extended to describe the entangle- ment between spins and dipoles.
We give a simple concrete description of the QSDL based on a minimal model which incorporates three key features of the QSDL, i.e., macroscopic classical degeneracy, quantum proton tunneling, and electron correlations.
The resulting QSDL is named quantum valence bond ice, and the property of this state will be discussed in detail from analytical and numerical perspectives.
Though this uniﬁed theory does not explain everything observed in H-Cat, especially the absence of a spin gap [16], we can understand some basic differences between H-Cat and D-Cat based on a universal nature of a quantum liquid.
Thus, while the model itself is idealized to some extent, it can give a clear physical picture of the state observed in H-Cat. II.
MODEL Since the primary purpose of the present study is to present a ﬁrm basis for hybrid spin liquids, it is desirable to introduce an appropriate model which is inspired by the candidate ma- terial H-Cat or D-Cat.
First, we focus on the electron sector of H-Cat or D-Cat where there are two inequivalent dimers (four sites) in the unit cell, and thus consider an idealized model where tetramers are introduced as a fundamental unit of the system.
The tetramer would be regarded as a pair of dimers, and therefore the model can describe not only the QSDL relevant to an H-bonded system but also a CDW state corresponding to a D-bonded system on an equal footing, as seen in H-Cat or D-Cat.
Our Hamiltonian contains both holes and protons, and is deﬁned by H = Hel + Hpro + Hel–pro, (1) Hel = tel  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ c† iscjs + Jel  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ Si · Sj, (2) Hpro = tpro  ⟨i j⟩ σ x i j + Jpro  ⟨⟨i j⟩,⟨kl⟩⟩ σ z i jσ z kl, (3) Hel–pro = g  ⟨i j⟩ (nj −ni)σ z i j. (4) The holes are described by the t-J model where double oc- cupancy is prohibited by the strong on-site interaction [39]: a real tel is a hole-hopping parameter inside a tetrahedron denoted by ⊠, and Jel > 0 is a spin-spin exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor (NN) holes (see Fig. 1).
cjs is an annihilation operator of a hole at the jth site with a spin s, and S j are spin-1/2 operators deﬁned for this hole.
The summation over s =↑, ↓is implied.
σi j are Pauli matrices deﬁned on each hydrogen bond ⟨i j⟩connecting the NN tetrahedra, and two eigenstates with eigenvalues ±1 of the σ z i j operator correspond to the stable positions of a proton on the hydrogen bond ⟨i j⟩ [16,19].
The tetrahedra sit on vertices of a diamond lattice and σ z i j is deﬁned such that σ z i j = +1 for the sites i ( j) belonging to the A (B) sublattice of the diamond lattice corresponds to a proton position away from the A-sublattice site i.
A real tpro represents quantum tunneling between the two positions, and Jpro > 0 is a Coulomb repulsion between the protons on a (a) (b) FIG.

For later purposes, an additional proton-proton interaction J′ pro and an intertetrahedron hole hopping t′ el are also shown.

We will later extend the model Eq. (1) and discuss effects of an additional proton- proton interaction and intertetrahedron hole hopping.
To be concrete, we consider a range of model parameters by referring to H-Cat or D-Cat.
Since the dimer Mott insu- lator H-Cat is a one-hole-ﬁlled system [11,13,16,18,19], we consider two-hole ﬁlling for each tetrahedron which is a coun- terpart with the same ﬁlling in our model.
Essentially the same argument can also be applied for a two-electron ﬁlling system.
While Hel has a form of the t-J model, Hpro is a transverse- ﬁeld Ising model on the frustrated pyrochlore lattice, and related models have been investigated as a model for quantum spin liquids [21–26].
g is supposed to be very large, i.e., g ∼O(103–4) K, because it comes from strong Coulomb re- pulsion.
Jpro is also large enough, i.e., Jpro ∼O(100) K, which is taken from the antiferroelectric transition temperature in D-Cat.
In addition, we suppose |tpro| ≪Jpro and |tel| ≪g by referring to the parameters in H-Cat where tpro ∼1-10 K and tel ∼10-100 K [11,16,18,19,40], which allows a perturbation theory with respect to tpro.
The magnetic coupling is assumed to be Jel ∼10-100 K taken from the value for H-Cat, and one can focus only on the singlet sector of a tetrahedron when the temperature is well below Jel.
This means that we consider a spin-gapped state for simplicity, but our theory is applicable even to the triplet sector just by replacing singlets by triplets, and thus our theory can be extended to the case where a spin gap is zero.
In addition, a gauge mean-ﬁeld theory is known to describe a fermionic excitation from an ice state [41], which would potentially describe the observed exotic excitations [16]. III.
ANALYSIS OF GROUND STATE A. QSDL as a U(1) quantum liquid In this section, the ground state of the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is discussed by mapping it to a quantum vertex model based 043077-2QUANTUM VALENCE BOND ICE THEORY FOR … PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 2, 043077 (2020) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 FIG. 2.

All arrows obey the ice rule.
on a perturbation theory.
In the case of tpro = 0, the Hamilto- nian is exactly solvable and the ground states are degenerate for all proton conﬁgurations obeying the ice rule.
In the limit of tel/g →0, the proton conﬁguration completely couples to the valence bonds of hole pairs, and the position of the valence bond is ﬁxed inside each tetrahedron in the ground states.
Since the valence bonds also form an ice conﬁguration, this state may be called classical valence bond ice.
This basically holds true even for a nonzero tel where one can diagonalize the electron Hamiltonian of each tetrahedron in the valence bond basis and the ground state of a tetrahedron will be a dressed valence bond state with a ﬁnite excitation gap ∼g.
Thus, every degenerate ground state of the total system at tel ̸= 0 is adiabatically connected from that at tel = 0.
We now introduce a quantum tunneling of protons tpro ̸= 0, which will lift the macroscopic degeneracy of the classical ground states in the same way as in the quantum spin ice [21–26].
We can treat the effects of tpro when |tpro|/Jpro ≪1 by using the degenerate perturbation theory.
Though essen- tially the same argument is true for a moderate tel, we assume the condition |tel|/g ≪1, which makes a physical picture clear.
Then, if a proton moves from its ground-state position to break the ice rule, a hole in the nearby tetrahedron will be pushed away from the proton because of the repulsive interaction g between them.
In this way, the proton motion is always accompanied by the hole hopping inside a tetrahedron and vice versa.
We note that such a charge-correlated hopping leads to effective coupling between spins and protons despite the absence of an explicit spin-orbit interaction.
In this sense, spin ﬂuctuations and proton ﬂuctuations are tightly connected with each other, which will eventually lead to the QSDL state.
A nontrivial contribution appears from the 6th-order perturbation in tpro/Jpro.
This process results in the following effective Hamiltonian in addition to a constant energy shift of the degenerate ground states, Heff = −K  plaquette [|⟲⟩⟨⟳| + |⟳⟩⟨⟲|], (5) where the ﬂipping operator is given by the product of the hole and proton operators along a hexagonal plaquette loop as shown in Fig. 2: |⟲⟩⟨⟳| = c† 1σ + 12c2c† 3σ − 34c4 · · · c† 11σ − 11,12c12 with σ ± = (σ x ± iσ y)/2 in the lowest-order approximation for tel/g (see Fig. 2 for the deﬁnition of the site numbers).
The sum runs over the hexagonal plaquettes of the diamond lattice, and the coefﬁcient K > 0 is estimated to be O(t6 pro/J5 pro) with a prefactor O(t6 el/g6) when |tel| is small (see Appendix A for details).
The effective Hamiltonian Eq. (5) is formally equivalent to the quantum ice model, which has been extensively studied in the context of the quantum spin ice [21–26].
We stress, however, that the physical constituents of the low-energy de- grees of freedom |⟲⟩, |⟳⟩are very different from those in the quantum spin ice; they are spin-dipole coupled degrees of freedom in the former, while solely spins in the latter.
The ground state of the effective Hamiltonian is known to be the quantum liquid state, which is described by an emergent compact U(1) electromagnetic ﬁeld which is deconﬁned in 3 + 1 dimensions.
Thus, we have theoretically established that the quantum proton motion can indeed drive the system into a QSDL, namely the quantum valence bond ice, and form a sta- ble three-dimensional (3D) phase.
It is stressed that both spins and protons are unfrozen simultaneously, forming a hybrid liquid state.
The coupled spins and dipoles behave as gapless “photons” of the emergent U(1) gauge theory, while local proton excitations which break the ice rule with an energy gap ∼Jpro are regarded as “monopoles” [21–26].
One of the most characteristic features of the QSDL is a large entanglement between protons and holes.
The corres- ponding entanglement entropy deﬁned by SEE = −Trel ρel ln ρel with ρel = Trpro |⟩⟨| for the ground state |⟩ can provide essential information of its entanglement structure.
Now one can estimate that SEE ∼ln(the number of ﬂippable ice states) = O(Ntot), where Ntot = Npro + Nel and Npro/el is the total number of proton bonds or electron sites.
This is easily understood for example based on the explicit calculation of SEE for the Rokhsar-Kivelson state [42] (see Appendix B).
Therefore, the QSDL has an entanglement entropy with a volume law in contrast to the area law for a real-space bipartition [43,44].
Such a large entanglement between protons and holes is an intrinsic nature of the QSDL, which is far beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
B. Stability of QSDL Up to here, we have been based on the idealized model Eq. (1) where a minimal number of terms are included to de- scribe the QSDL.
However, we can consider additional terms in general, and considerations on such terms are important to discuss the relevance of our model to real materials.
Here, we try to study the stability of the QSDL by introducing two types of perturbations into the model Eq. (1): (i) an additional interaction between protons which favors a classical order by lifting the macroscopic degeneracy of protons, and (ii) an intertetrahedron hole hopping which may also lift the macro- scopic degeneracy of electrons.
The following discussions will be supplemented with numerical calculations later.
First, we examine effects of additional proton interactions such as J′ pro  σ z i jσ z kl shown in Fig. 1(b), and discuss impli- cations for the qualitative difference in X-Cat (X = H, D).
The additional interaction lifts the macroscopic degeneracy of the classical ground states, and an inﬁnitesimal J′ pro will lead to an ordered state when tpro = 0 by the order-by-disorder 043077-3MASAHIKO G. YAMADA AND YASUHIRO TADA PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 2, 043077 (2020) FIG.
3. (a) Schematic phase diagram for the 3D thermodynamic system in the tpro-J′ pro plane.
The entanglement entropy SEE is small in the AFE-VBS phase, while it is large exhibiting the clear volume law SEE = O(volume) in the QSDL phase.
“Polarized proton” in the large-tpro region means that protons are aligning in the direction of the “transverse ﬁeld” tpro.
(b) Entanglement entropy for the ﬁnite- size 2D system Eq. (10) calculated by the exact diagonalization.
The parameters used are (tel, g,t′ el) = (0.3, 2.0, 0.0) in units of Jpro = 1.0. mechanism.
Indeed, classical (tpro = 0) spin ice models with additional interactions have been extensively studied, where several ordered states are stabilized depending on types of the additional interactions [45,46].
In the present system, we consider the J′ pro interaction which favors an antiferroelectric (AFE) state of protons, but it competes with the quantum tunneling tpro [9,22,41].
Based on these observations, one can draw a schematic phase diagram of the perturbed model with both J′ pro and tpro as shown in Fig. 3(a), where the QSDL with a large entanglement entropy remains stable for J′ pro ≪K, while the AFE state with a small entanglement is favored for J′ pro ≫K. Note that, because g ≫|tel|, holes simultaneously show a valence bond solid (VBS) state corresponding to the proton AFE state when J′ pro ≫K. Experimentally, an H bond will have a larger tpro and hence a larger K than a D bond.
Therefore, an H-bonded system can exhibit a QSDL, while a D-bonded system shows a classically ordered AFE-VBS state.
This is a generic feature of proton-driven quantum liquids and therefore may be relevant to the experimentally observed isotope effect in X-Cat, where H-Cat is a QSDL while D-Cat exhibits an AFE CDW order [11,13,16].
The observed isotope effect can be attributed to this competition.
Note that, ac- cording to the previous studies of the pyrochlore spin liquids [47,48], a sufﬁciently large tpro will lead to the trivial polarized state of protons where they are simply aligned in the direction of the “transverse ﬁeld,” which is nothing but the proton tunneling tpro.
In this state, the proton sector will be decoupled from the electron sector, resulting in vanishing entangle- ment between them.
This state is not a quantum liquid state, although the protons are ﬂuctuating in the σz basis.
We ob- served reduction of the entanglement entropy for tpro/Jpro ≳1 in our numerical calculations of the ﬁnite-size system (not shown).
However, the polarized proton state seems irrelevant to H-Cat since tpro is estimated to be 1–10 K and tpro ≪Jpro is easily satisﬁed [16].
Next, we consider the intertetrahedron hole hopping along the hydrogen bonds, t′ el  ⟨i j⟩c† iσcjσ as shown in Fig. 1(b), within a perturbative regime |t′ el| ≪|tel|.
The intertetrahedron hole hopping will induce several possible interactions be- tween the valence bonds on neighboring tetrahedra.
To see this, we consider an extended Hubbard model of holes from which the t-J model in Eq. (1) is derived.
The Hubbard Hamil- tonian for holes is ˜Hel = Ht + HU, (6) Ht = tel  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ c† iscjs + t′ el  ⟨i j⟩ c† iscjs, (7) HU = U  i ni↑ni↓+ V  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ ninj, (8) where t′ el is an intertetrahedron hopping along a hydrogen bond ⟨i j⟩. Here U > 0 is an on-site interaction and V (< U ) is an intersite interaction within each tetrahedron.
The 2nd-order perturbation in Ht gives rise to sev- eral terms, Jel[Si · S j −ninj/4] with Jel = 2t2 el/(U −V ), J′ el[Si · Sj −ninj/4] with J′ el = 2t′2 el /U, and J′′ el[ni(nj −1) + (ni −1)nj] with J′′ el = t′2 el /V .
The ﬁrst term is an exchange interaction inside each tetrahedron, which is included in Eq. (1), while the other two terms are new intertetrahedron interactions.
Sufﬁciently large U ≫|tel| and V ≫|t′ el| lead to constraints on possible hole ﬁlling so that ni ⩽1 for all sites i, and  i∈⊠ni = 2 for each tetrahedron assuming quarter ﬁlling of holes.
The resulting state can be considered as a “tetramer Mott insulator,” as expected.
The perturbed Hamiltonian is now reduced to ˜Hel ≃tel  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ c† iscjs + Jel  ⊠  i,j∈⊠ [Si · S j −ninj/4] + J′ el  ⟨i j⟩ [Si · S j −ninj/4] + J′′ el  ⟨i j⟩ [ni(nj −1) + (ni −1)nj].
(9) In the following, we only consider a singlet-pair state of holes on each tetrahedron since there is an energy gap ∼Jel ≫J′ el, J′′ el between singlet and triplet states.
We note that −(Jel/4)  i,j∈⊠ninj terms do not matter in the present system where the total fermion number inside a tetrahedron ⊠ is ﬁxed.
The J′ el term is nonzero only when both of the two sites connected by the hydrogen bond ⟨i, j⟩are occupied, and similarly the J′′ el term is nonzero only when one of the two sites connected by the hydrogen bond is occupied.
Effects of the J′ el term will be strongly suppressed by a large interaction g ≫J′ el between holes and protons included in the original model, because of the energy cost due to g for a conﬁguration favored by J′ el.
On the other hand, the J′′ el term effectively adds to the interaction g, because the J′′ el term also favors common local charge conﬁgurations as the g term does.
Therefore, these two potential interactions between singlet pairs on the nearest-neighbor tetrahedra could effectively be absorbed into the interaction g, or equivalently the intratetrahedron hopping tel.
Then, it is concluded that thanks to the stability of the QSDL for a wide range of tel/g, the QSDL is also stable with respect to the intertetrahedron hopping t′ el.
This behavior is numerically conﬁrmed by exact diagonalization in the next section.

C. Numerical calculations The above discussions on the stability can be supplemented by numerical calculations using exact diagonalization for a ﬁnite-size system with perturbations, such as the J′ pro term.
To this end, we consider a 2D version of our model Eq. (1) which consists of 8 proton bonds and 16 electron sites (8 holes) with a periodic boundary condition.
Although the system size is very small, this model can reproduce many of the main results in the previous sections and thus supports the above discussions.
The Hamiltonian used in the numerical exact diagonalization is written as Htot = H + Hpert, (10) where H is a two-dimensional (2D) version of Eq. (1), in which tetrahedra are located on vertices of a square lattice as shown in Fig. 4.
Hpert describes perturbations, Hpert = J′ pro  ⟨i j⟩,⟨kl⟩ ηi j klσ z i jσ z kl + J′ el  ⟨i j⟩ [Si · Sj −ninj/4] + J′′ el  ⟨i j⟩ [ni(nj −1) + (ni −1)nj].
(11) The J′ pro term represents an additional interaction between protons with properly chosen ηi j kl = ±1 which favors an an- tiferroelectric state, and the J′ el, J′′ el terms are intertetrahedron interactions between holes taken from Eq. (9).
Note that for a large g, holes simultaneously exhibit the valence bond solid state out of the classical valence bond ice manifold corre- sponding to the proton AFE state.
In the present ﬁnite-size system, there are 18 ice states at tpro = J′ pro = J′ el = J′′ el = 0, and 16 are connected by the 2nd-order perturbation in tpro.
The 2nd-order tunneling is possible because the linear system size for one direction is 2 and the periodic boundary condition has been imposed.
Furthermore, the conservation of the total spin for each tetrahedron, [H, S⊠] = 0 for S⊠=  i∈⊠Si, greatly reduces the computational cost for the unperturbed Hamilto- nian H. Taking this advantage, we focus only on the subspace where S⊠= 0 for every tetrahedron also for the perturbed Hamiltonian Htot, since there is an energy gap ∼Jel between the S⊠≡0 sector and other sectors in H. From now on, we omit Jel because the triplet sectors of the original Hilbert space are all projected out.
When J′ pro is moderately strong, the 2D model shows an AFE state of the protons and the holes simultaneously form a VBS state for a large g.
This state will have a corresponding long-range order in the thermodynamic limit.
On the other hand, for a small J′ pro, it can exhibit a QSDL-like state which is a superposition of many ﬂippable ice states.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that out of the total N = 18 ice states there are Nﬂip = 16 ice states, which are connected by the lowest-order pertur- bation in tpro.
The QSDL-like state is essentially given by a superposition of these 16 reduced ice states.
The AFE-VBS state is clearly distinguished from the QSDL-like state even in the present ﬁnite-size system, which is well captured by the entanglement entropy SEE(tpro, J′ pro) between protons and holes.
The entanglement entropy is given by SEE = −Trel ρel ln ρel = −  n λn ln λn, (12) where {λn} are the squared singular values of the Schmidt decomposition of the ground state wave function |⟩into the proton and electron subspaces, |⟩=  n  λn |pron⟩⊗|eln⟩. (13) The results are shown in Fig. 3(b), where the two ground states—the AFE-VBS state and the QSDL state—are well characterized by SEE.
The saturated value SEE ≃ln 16 for a large tpro means that the ground state is essentially given by the superposition of 16 ﬂippable ice states with a nearly equal weight, and the ground state can be considered as a QSDL in this sense.
Note that the QSDL is a stable phase extended in the parameter space, although it is parametrically small as ex- pected from other quantum ice systems.
In the limit of tpro → 0, the ground state is given by a superposition of simple AFE- VBS states with fourfold degeneracy due to the translational and rotational symmetries.
Therefore, SEE(tpro →0) →ln 4 for such a state, while SEE →ln Nﬂip = ln 16 deeply inside the QSDL region with a moderately large tpro.
This qualita- tively reproduces the phase diagram in Fig. 3(a) proposed to describe the difference between H-Cat and D-Cat.
In the 3D thermodynamic system, Nﬂip, N ∼eNtot and the present QSDL-like state will be replaced by a true quantum liquid state where a macroscopic number of ice states are in- volved, resulting in a large entanglement entropy, SEE ∼Ntot.
Note that similar crossover behaviors in the ﬁnite-size system can also be seen in correlation functions, and those quantities will characterize the corresponding phase transition in the thermodynamic limit.
We can also discuss the effects of an intertetrahedron hopping t′ el, and numerical results suggest that induced intertetrahedron valence bond interactions have only small effects on the QSDL if |t′ el| ≪|tel|, and the QSDL is parametrically stable.
Detailed studies on the stability of the QSDL would require more elaborate investigations, such as cluster-based calculations [49], and are left for a future study.

Correlation functions (a) ⟨O2 AFE⟩for protons and (b) ⟨O2 VBS⟩for holes.
The parameters are the same as used in Fig. 3, (tel, g,t′ el) = (0.3, 2.0, 0.0), in units of Jpro = 1.0.
Similar characterization is also possible by correlation functions corresponding to the long-range order of the AFE and VBS.
We consider the following two order parameters, OAFE = 1 Npro  ⟨i j⟩ ηi jσ z i j, (14) OVBS = 4 Nel  ⊠ |VBS⊠⟩⟨VBS⊠| , (15) where ηi j = ±1 characterizes the proton AFE conﬁguration and |VBS⊠⟩ is the VBS conﬁguration of the holes on a tetrahedron corresponding to the proton AFE shown in Fig. 4(b).
The calculation results are shown in Fig. 5. Note that the AFE correlation function can be evaluated explicitly for an extreme AFE state of protons, |AFE⟩= (1/ √ 4) 4 k=1 ⊗⟨i j⟩|σ z i j = η(k) i j ⟩ with {η(k) i j }4 k=1 being 4 degenerate AFE conﬁgurations, and it is given by ⟨AFE| O2 AFE |AFE⟩= 1/2.
Similarly, for an extreme QSDL state |QSDL⟩= (1/Nﬂip)  C∈ﬂip |proC⟩⊗|elC⟩ which is the equal-weight superposition of Nﬂip = 16 ﬂippable ice states, the AFE correlation is given by ⟨QSDL| O2 AFE |QSDL⟩= 1/4.
These behaviors are reproduced in the numerical calculations.
Note that ⟨QSDL| O2 AFE |QSDL⟩→0 in the thermodynamic limit.
The same thing happens for ⟨O2 VBS⟩.
Next, we discuss the effect of the intertetrahedron in- teractions J′ el, J′′ el arising from the hole hopping |t′ el| ≪|tel|.
Figure 6 shows entanglement entropies SEE for different val- ues of (g, J′ el) at J′′ el = 0 and (g, J′′ el) at J′ el = 0.
The other parameters used are tpro = 0.2Jpro, J′ pro = 0.
Here SEE(g, J′ el) is only slightly decreased by the introduction of J′ el, because it competes with g, but is negligible for a large g.
We see that SEE(g, J′′ el) is a little enhanced by J′′ el, since it favors valence FIG. 6.
Entanglement entropies (a) SEE(g, J′ el) at J′′ el = 0 and (b) SEE(g, J′′ el) at J′ el = 0.
The other parameters are tpro = 0.2Jpro, J′ pro = 0.
bond conﬁgurations including the ﬂippable ice states.
These behaviors are consistent with the qualitative discussion in the previous section.
Therefore, the QSDL is parametrically stable for a small intertetrahedron hole hopping t′ el. IV.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION We have developed a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid, QSDL, by combining the quantum proton ice and Anderson’s RVB state, motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the quantum spin liquid with proton ﬂuctuations in H-Cat.
We proposed an idealized model and demonstrated that proton tunneling drives the system into the quantum valence bond ice, a QSDL described by an emergent U(1) gauge theory.
Our theory sheds light on the essential roles of protons in the realization of QSDLs by proposing a coherent understand- ing of spin-dipole coupled systems, and thus can provide a basis for future developments not only for X-Cat but also for other QSDL candidate systems [31,50].
For example, a hydrogen-assisted Kitaev spin liquid material H3LiIr2O6 was recently discovered [31], and proton tunneling is suggested to be important to stabilize the quantum spin liquid [51–54].
In addition, although we have been based on the idealized model Eq. (1) to elucidate the impacts of H bonds, such a model itself could be designed in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
Indeed, there are a variety of H-bonded MOFs and the nature of the H bonds have been discussed extensively [55,56].
Re- alization of an ideal system for a hybrid quantum liquid by utilizing the ﬂexibility of MOFs would be an interesting future direction.
The large entanglement predicted by our theory charac- terizes a QSDL in general, and it would lead to spin-dipole coupled dynamics such as a magnetoelectric effect, which could provide an experimental signature of the entangled spins and protons.
Other experimentally observable quantities characterizing a QSDL are dynamical ones, which can be captured by neutron scattering or nuclear magnetic resonance.
Further investigation is necessary to discover a smoking gun signature for the strong entanglement between the two degrees of freedom.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF A QUANTUM ICE MODEL Here we derive the effective low-energy Hamiltonian Eq. (5) from the original Hamiltonian Eq. (1), based on the 043077-6QUANTUM VALENCE BOND ICE THEORY FOR … PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 2, 043077 (2020) FIG.

degenerate perturbation theory with respect to tpro.
The 6th- order perturbation in tpro gives Heff = PVt 1 −P E0 −H0 Vt · · ·Vt 1 −P E0 −H0 VtP, (A1) where we decompose the original Hamiltonian H(tpro) given by Eq. (1) into H(tpro) = H0 + Vt, and H0 = H(tpro = 0).
Here P is a projection operator onto the degenerate ice state manifold with an energy E0.
Though an intratetrahedron hole hopping tel has been in- cluded in H0 and the perturbation itself is done for a small tpro/Jpro, we concentrate on a principal contribution coming from the lowest order of tel/g.
To do this, we take a basis set consisting of product states of hole and proton sectors {|pro⟩⊗|el⟩}.
Each hole state |el⟩can be explicitly obtained by diagonalizing the hole Hamiltonian of each tetrahedron for a given proton conﬁguration |pro⟩. By inserting an iden- tity operator, 1 =  |pro⟩⊗|el⟩⟨pro| ⊗⟨el| , we ﬁnd for two ﬂippable ice states |a⟩, |b⟩, hab ≃ −12t6 pro(21J3 + 118GJ2 + 214G2J + 120G3) (J + G)3(J + 2G)2(J + 3G)(J + 4G)(J + 5G) × ⟨ela|elb⟩, (A2) where hab = ⟨a|Heff|b⟩, J = 4Jpro, and G = 2g. Here |ela(b)⟩ is the hole wave function in the ice state a (b).
The overlap matrix element can be calculated numerically and is O(t6 el/g6) for a small |tel| as shown in Fig. 7.
Amplitude of the overlap takes the same value for any pair of electron states connected by the 6th-order perturbation of tpro, and therefore we simply denote K ≡−hab to obtain Eq. (5) in the main text as Heff = −K  |a⟩⟨b| .
The effective Hamiltonian can explicitly be expressed in terms of hole operators c(†) is , and |ela⟩⟨elb| =  plaquette c† iscjs (i, j ∈⊠) is simply a ring-hopping operator for each hexagonal plaquette loop in the leading order of the perturbation in tel/g. APPENDIX B: ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY FOR THE ROKHSAR-KIVELSON STATE The entanglement entropy between protons and electrons can be calculated explicitly for an extreme limit of a quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL), the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) state.
The RK state is the exact ground state of the ice model Eq. (5) in the main text with an additional potential μ [|⟲⟩⟨⟲| + |⟳⟩⟨⟳|] ﬁne-tuned to μ = K. The RK state is a superposi- tion of all possible ice states, |RK⟩= (1/ √ N )  C |proC⟩⊗ |elC⟩, where C represents an ice conﬁguration and N is the dimension of the ice manifold.
|proC⟩and |elC⟩are proton and electron wave functions for a ﬁxed ice conﬁguration C.
The entanglement entropy between protons and holes is given by SEE = ln N and it obeys a clear volume law SEE = O(Ntot).
