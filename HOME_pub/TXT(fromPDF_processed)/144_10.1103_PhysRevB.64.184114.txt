A ferroelectric monoclinic phase of space group Cm ~M A type! has been discovered in 0.65 Pb~Mg1/3Nb2/3!O3-0.35 PbTiO3 by means of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction.
It appears at room temperature in a single crystal previously poled under an electric ﬁeld of 43 kV/cm applied along the pseudocubic @001# direction, in the region of the phase diagram around the morphotropic phase boundary between the rhombohedral (R3m) and the tetragonal (P4mm) phases.
The monoclinic phase has lattice parameters a55.692 Å, b55.679 Å, c54.050 Å, and b590.15°, with the bm axis oriented along the pseudocubic @110# direction.
It is similar to the monoclinic phase observed in PbZr12xTixO3, but different from that recently found in Pb~Zn1/3Nb2/3!O3-PbTiO3, which is of space group Pm ~M C type!.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.64.184114 PACS number~s!: 77.84.Bw, 61.10.Nz I. INTRODUCTION The complex perovskite Pb~Mg1/3Nb2/3!O3 ~PMN!
exhib- its typical relaxor-type ferroelectric properties which have been intensively studied for both fundamental and practical reasons.1–3 The relaxor state is characterized by the frustra- tion of local polarizations which prevents long-range ferro- electric order from developing completely.
Although the lo- cal symmetry of the polar domains is rhombohedral, the macroscopic symmetry of PMN remains cubic below the temperature of maximum permittivity.
A ferroelectric phase can be induced either by application of an electric ﬁeld along @111#cub,4 or by partial substitution of Ti41 for the complex (Mg1/3Nb2/3)41 ions.5 In both cases, the micropolar domains transform into macrodomains with cubic-to-rhombohedral symmetry breaking.4,6 With Ti substitution, a complete solid solution forms between PMN and PbTiO3, (12x)PMN 2xPT ~PMN-PT!, with a morphotropic phase boundary ~MPB!
located at x'0.35, which has hitherto been believed to represent the frontier between the rhombohedral ~relaxor side!
and tetragonal ~ferroelectric side!
phases,5 as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Single crystals of PMN-PT and other relaxor-PT solid so- lutions, namely, Pb~Zn1/3Nb2/3!O3-PT ~PZN-PT!, with com- positions near the respective MPB’s, have been reported to exhibit very high piezoelectric coefﬁcients (d33 .2500 pC/N), extremely large piezoelectric strains ~.1.7%!, and very high electromechanical coupling factors (k33.92%).7–11 Such excellent properties point to a poten- tial revolution in electromechanical transduction for a broad range of applications.
From the crystal chemistry viewpoint, the strong piezoelectric response of those materials is asso- ciated with the MPB, and very recently intensive theoretical and experimental research has been undertaken in order to understand the origin of these enhanced piezoelectric prop- erties.
The experimental breakthroughs have been achieved by the discovery of ferroelectric monoclinic and orthorhom- bic phases by high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction.
In PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 ~PZT48!, a monoclinic phase with space group Cm ~of M A type, in the Vanderbilt and Cohen notation12!
was found below room temperature.
In such a phase, the monoclinic b axis lies along pseudocubic @11¯0#, and the polarization is in the (11¯0) plane.13,14 In the PZN-PT system, an orthorhombic phase was found to exist between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases at around 10%PT.15 Upon application of an electric ﬁeld along @001#cub, evi- dence of polarization rotation via a monoclinic phase has been shown for PZN-8%PT,16 which is in agreement with the theoretical considerations by ﬁrst-principles calculations for the PZT case.17,18 So far, several pictures of the phase states near the MPB of the PMN-PT system have been proposed.
Shrout et al.5 initially suggested that the rhombohedral R3m phase of smaller Ti concentration and the tetragonal P4mm phase of higher Ti content, were separated by a fairly sharp phase boundary at 35%PT.
The authors of Ref. 19 reported a large composition range around the MPB in which the rhombohe- dral and tetragonal phases coexist.
Optical domain studies showed that the R3m and P4mm phases may coexist at room temperature, with transformation from the R3m into the P4mm phase taking place over a wide temperature interval.6 In the present paper, we report the results of a high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction study of 0.65 Pb~Mg1/3Nb2/3!O3-0.35 PbTiO3 (PMN-35%PT) single FIG.

EXPERIMENT Single crystals of PMN-35%PT were grown from a high- temperature solution using an optimum ﬂux composition (50 wt %PMNT149 wt %PbO11 wt %B2O3).20 Two plate- lets, No. 1, 65 mm thick, and No. 2, 165 mm thick, were cut parallel to the reference (001)cub plane, and polished with ﬁne diamond paste ~down to 1 mm!.
The (001)cub faces were covered with Ag paste, Au wires were attached, and platelets Nos. 1 and 2 were poled under electric ﬁelds of 43 and 5 kV/cm, respectively, which were applied along @001#cub at 200 °C ~above TC! and maintained while cooling down to room temperature.
The samples were then short circuited for 30 min before the electrodes were removed.
Synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments were performed at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source ~NSLS!.
The PMN-35% PT crystal No. 1 poled at 43 kV/cm was studied at beam line X22A with 30-keV x-rays from the third-order reﬂection of a Si~111! monochromator.
The mea- surements were made on a Huber four-circle diffractometer equipped with a Si~111! analyzer.
X-ray powder diffraction was also performed on PMN-35%PT at beam line X7A with 18-keV x-rays from a Si~111!
double-crystal monochromator (l'0.7 Å.) PMN-PT crystal No. 2, previously poled at 5 kV/cm was crushed and sieved to produce a powder sample with large crystallites ~38–44 mm!
that we call a properly arranged single crystal ~PASC!, in order to obtain sharp pow- der lines free from sample-broadening effects.
A 0.2-mm capillary loaded with the specimen was mounted on a Huber diffractometer equipped with a Ge~220! analyzer.
The result- ing instrumental resolution is about 0.005° on the 2u scale. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 2 gives three examples of the contour maps ob- served in different cubic zones around the ~002!, ~300!, and ~330!
reﬂection peaks for the PMN-35%PT crystal No. 1.
For these experiments, the Bragg indices H5K5L51 were deﬁned to correspond to the cubic lattice parameters a5b 5c54.016 Å for all the cases.
To interpret the diffraction patterns observed in Fig. 2 and to illustrate the structure of the PMN-35%PT, we need to consider the possible domain conﬁgurations based on group- subgroup symmetry relationship.
The high-temperature pro- totype phase has Pm3¯m space group symmetry.
The phase transitions into a rhombohedral R3m phase, or a monoclinic m phase would normally result in eight or 24 ~fully! ferro- electric or ~partially!
ferroelastic domain states, respectively.21 The domain structures are therefore very com- plicated, especially for the monoclinic phase.
However, a much-simpliﬁed situation is produced by electric-ﬁeld pol- ing, which constrains the c axis to lie along the pseudocubic @001# direction, analogous to the situation previously dis- cussed for PZN-8%PT.16 The monoclinic domain conﬁgura- tion now consists of two b domains related by a 90° rotation around the c axis, each of which contains two domains.
The contour map of Fig. 2~a! shows a single d spacing in the H0L zone measured around the ~002! reﬂection, which gives the parameter c54.050 Å.
The fact that a single d spacing was observed in this region demonstrates that the c axis is indeed ﬁxed along the poling ﬁeld direction of pseudocubic @001#, and that the poled state remains stable after the ﬁeld is removed.
The very weak extra peaks ob- served in the transverse direction may correspond to slightly misaligned regions close to the surface, since they were not observed with high-energy x-rays at 67 keV. Figure 2~b!
is the contour map obtained around the pseudocubic ~300!
peak in the H0L zone, and shows a symmetrical splitting along the transverse L direction.
This splitting can be attributed to the two a domains, but it is in sharp contrast to the three peaks observed for the ~200!
reﬂection from PZN-8%PT,15 which has monoclinic symmetry of type M C ~in the Vanderbilt-Cohen notation12!.
On the other hand, the contour map around the pseudocubic ~330!
reﬂection shown in Fig. 2~c! is seen to contain three peaks, and in conjunction with Fig. 2~b! provides the signature of a monoclinic structure of M A type with am and bm directed along pseudocubic @1¯ 1¯ 0# and @11¯0#.
The split peak is located at H5K52.993 and the single peak at H5K53.000, corresponding to lattice param- eters am55.692 Å and bm55.679 Å.

The projection of the monoclinic angle (b8'b&) can also be deduced independently from the splitting of the ~300! peak in Fig. 2~b!, namely, L50.012, which yields a similar value of 90.16°.
Finally, we note that although a rhombohedral domain structure could also give qualitatively similar features, such a structure can immedi- ately be excluded, since the requirements of rhombohedral symmetry would impose constraints on the lattice parameters @e.g., cm 2 5(am 2 1bm 2 )/4# which are clearly not satisﬁed.
Thus we conclude that a monoclinic phase of M A type has been unambiguously shown to exist in the PMN-35%PT crystal.

MONOCLINIC PHASE IN THE RELAXOR-BASED . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 64 184114 184114-3ﬂections showed split doublets.
These patterns can be clearly indexed as a single rhombohedral R phase with a54.023 Å and a589.88°.
Therefore, unpoled or weakly poled PMN- 35%PT samples show an average rhombohedral phase, con- sistent with the reported MPB phase diagram.5 IV.
CONCLUSIONS A monoclinic phase of space group Cm ~M A type! was discovered in a PMN-35%PT crystal at room temperature by means of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction.
This M A phase has its monoclinic am and bm axes oriented along the pseudocubic @11¯0# and @110# directions, respectively, with the cm axis along the pseudocubic @001# direction.
The unit-cell parameters are found to be am('ac&)55.692 Å, bm('ac&)55.679 Å, cm('ac)54.050 Å, and b590.15°.
This monoclinic phase exhibits the same crystallographic features as the one reported for PbZr12xTixO3 ~i.e., a doubled cell rotated by 45° around the c axis with respect to the tetragonal unit cell!,13 but is different from the M C-type monoclinic phase ~space group Pm! recently reported in PZN-8%PT, where the monoclinic bm axis lies along @01¯0#cub.15 The monoclinic phase appears at room temperature in a PMN-35%PT crystal previously poled under an electric ﬁeld of 43 kV/cm applied along the @001#cub direction.
On the other hand, unpoled and weakly poled PMN-35%PT samples exhibit an average rhombohedral symmetry.
Although poling at high ﬁeld along the @001#cub direction may be necessary in order to produce a long-range monoclinic phase for the com- position, this point is not yet fully settled, and we hope to clarify it in future experiments.
The existence of the mono- clinic phase in PMN-35%PT allows us to construct an up- dated phase diagram for the PMN-PT solid solution system, in which a narrow monoclinic phase region exists between the rhomboheral R3m and tetragonal P4mm phases at low temperatures, as indicated by the dashed area in Fig. 1. More extended work is underway in order to provide a better un- derstanding of the nature of the MPB and the origin of the outstanding piezoelectric performance of PMN-PT crystals, and will be reported elsewhere.
After the submission of this paper, two important papers have appeared: Xu et al.22 reported the observation of mono- clinic domains by polarized light microscopy, and Lu et al.23 showed the existence of an orthorhombic phase in 0.67PMN- 0.33PT crystals.
