Direct access to the dynamics of spin-to- charge conversion (SCC)—a crucial ingre- dient in optimizing TI based spintronic  devices—remains conspicuously missing.
The difficultly of tracking SCC dynamics  stems from the need to address both the  ultrafast timescales involved as well as  obtain spin resolution simultaneously.
In this work, we probe the dynamical  processes of SCC in Bi2Se3/Co hetero- structures directly for the first time, via  ultrafast spin injection and terahertz (THz)  emission spectroscopy.
Ultrafast spin  injection from ferromagnetic Co enables  transient spin currents to be injected.[20–23] At the same time, given the challenging  timescales involved, THz emission spectroscopy—the central  signature we track—is a powerful optical tool, which offers a  contact-free amperemeter with sub-picosecond resolution.
As  we describe below, this technique combined with a systematic  exhaustion of the experimental parameters of the Bi2Se3/Co het- erostructures and our ultrafast setup (thickness, temperature,  Co magnetization direction, optical pulse polarization, etc.),  Strong spin–orbit coupling, resulting in the formation of spin-momentum- locked surface states, endows topological insulators with superior  spin-to-charge conversion characteristics, though the dynamics that govern it   have remained elusive.
Here, an all-optical method is presented, which enables  unprecedented tracking of the ultrafast dynamics of spin-to-charge conversion  in a prototypical topological insulator Bi2Se3/ferromagnetic Co heterostructure,  down to the sub-picosecond timescale.
Compared to pure Bi2Se3 or Co, a giant  terahertz emission is observed in the heterostructure that originates from  spin-to-charge conversion, in which the topological surface states play a cru- cial role.
A 0.12 ps timescale is identified that sets a technological speed limit  of spin-to-charge conversion processes in topological insulators.
In addition, it  is shown that the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency is temperature inde- pendent in Bi2Se3 as expected from the nature of the surface states, paving the  way for designing next-generation high-speed optospintronic devices based on  topological insulators at room temperature.
Terahertz Spintronics Topological insulators (TIs) provide a fascinating example where  strong spin–orbit interaction leads to the formation of spin- momentum-locked (topological) surface states,[1,2] and are anti­ cipated to mediate superior spin–charge interconversion.[3,4] As  a result, employing conventional steady-state transport set-ups,  TIs have been exploited to exert spin orbit torque on the adjacent  ferromagnetic (FM) layers,[5–12] as well as generate charge  Dr. X.

In particular, we find a highly efficient THz emission  (mediated by ultrafast spin injection) from the Bi2Se3/Co het- erostructures.
Strikingly, this far outstrips (by up to an order of  magnitude) the emission of either bare Bi2Se3 or Co films taken  individually, indicating the highly efficient SCC in the Bi2Se3/ Co stack, as well as the central role SCC plays in the optical  response of the heterostructure.
Crucially, the THz signal in  the Bi2Se3/Co stack exhibits a significant enhancement when  the thickness of Bi2Se3 increases from four to six quintuple  layers.
Coinciding with the appearance of well-defined surface  states,[24] this indicates the dominant role of surface states in  the SCC processes.
In addition, varying pump polarization enables a direct  tracking of the SCC process.
We identify the fundamental time- scale for ultrafast SCC formation in Bi2Se3/Co to be 0.12  ps.
This sets a characteristic cut-off time for SCC processes in TI  spintronic heterostructures.
Our results provide fundamental  insights into the ultrafast SCC processes and indicate the  central role of topological surface states in the very efficient  SCC at room temperature for THz optospintronic applications.
In order to methodically delineate the THz emission sig- nals in our Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures (see below), we first  describe the optical response (focusing on its THz response)  of pure Bi2Se3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE).
As we will discuss, this enables us to clearly isolate the  new dynamics that arises due to the TI/FM heterostructure  stack from the response of either the pure TI or pure FM by  themselves.
Bi2Se3 thin-film samples were setup in a transmission   geometry, as shown in Figure 1a, where an 800 nm pump beam  with 60 mW power impinged on the samples at normal inci- dence, and only the vertical components of the emitted THz  pulses were detected by electro-optic sampling.
The typical THz  electric field waveforms emitted from Bi2Se3 films are plotted in  Figure 1b.
The spectra of the detected THz signals, as shown in  the inset of Figure 1b, covers the frequency range up to 3 THz,  which is limited by the electro-optic detection of 1 mm thick  ZnTe crystal.
A SiO2 capping layer is essential to protect the  Bi2Se3 film from the atmosphere, and prevent the evaporation  Adv. Mater.

KGaA, Weinheim 1802356  (3 of 8) www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com of the thin film under pulsed-laser illumination due to the  weak van der Waals type coupling between the two neighboring  quintuple layers (QLs, 1 QL ≈ 1  nm).[25] The detected THz  traces show a distinct dependence on the pump polarization.
Figure 1c shows the THz peak amplitude as a function of pump  polarization angle, which can be fitted well by a sinusoidal  function with a period of 180°.
In addition, the dependence of  THz amplitude on sample azimuthal angle reveals a charac- teristic three-fold symmetry (see Figure S2 in the Supporting  Information), which is associated with the crystalline symmetry  of Bi2Se3.[26] These are in good agreement with the expecta- tions from the shift current mechanism (see Section S2 in the  Supporting Information for further exclusion of other mecha- nisms).[27,28] Additionally, we note that the dependence of the  THz peak amplitude on the incident pump power, as indicated  in the inset of Figure 1d, shows a nonlinear behavior, which  we attribute to saturable absorption (Section S3, Supporting  Information).[29] In principle, the shift current is a second-order non- linear effect, which requires the breaking of spatial inversion  symmetry,[30–32] and hence can only be excited on the surface  of 3D TIs.[33–35] Consequently, the amplitude should be inde- pendent of the thickness of the Bi2Se3 film.
Indeed, the THz  peak amplitude is roughly constant for the samples above  6 QL, as illustrated in Figure 1d.
Interestingly, for the 4-QL  sample, the measured THz signal is about one order of mag- nitude smaller than that from the films above 6 QL.
It has  been reported that the shift current in Bi2Se3 originates from  the transient charge transfer along the Se–Bi bonds involving  the surface-states-related optical transitions.[27] However, for the  ultrathin Bi2Se3 film with a thickness below 6 QL, the coupling  between the top and bottom surface opens a gap in the  surface-state dispersion,[24] and hence suppresses the surface- states-related optical transitions.[36] Therefore, the shift current  and resulting THz emission decrease considerably.
This obser- vation indicates that the THz emission from pure Bi2Se3 film is  a surface-dominated response.
We now turn to investigate the THz response of Bi2Se3/ Co heterostructures.
As we show below, the dynamics of this  TI/FM heterostructure starkly contrasts with that of the TI by  itself.
The experiments are performed under identical condi- tions as that for the pure Bi2Se3 films, except that an in-plane  external static magnetic field ≈800 Oe is applied to orient the  Co magnetization, as sketched in Figure 2a.
The THz wave- form emitted from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure, together with  that from pure Bi2Se3 and Co films, is shown in Figure 2b.
Strikingly, the THz emission from the heterostructure  is significantly enhanced after the deposition of a Co layer.
Indeed, for the same TI film thickness, the THz emission  amplitude from the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure (orange curve)  is about an order of magnitude larger than that of a pure  Bi2Se3 film by itself (blue curve).
We note that the detected  THz emission from a 3 nm Co film by itself (green curve) is  weak; this indicates that the laser-induced demagnetization in  the magnetic film contributes negligibly to THz emission in  TI/FM heterostructures.[37,38] Furthermore, in contrast to that  of the pure Bi2Se3 film, the THz emission amplitude from the  heterostructure obeys a linear power dependence up to high  power (>40 mW), as illustrated in the inset of Figure 2d.
These  observations indicate that THz emission from the heterostruc- ture cannot be explained by dynamics from that of the pure TI  or FM by themselves.
Instead, as we now explain, it arises from the novel coupled  spin–charge dynamics in the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure.
In  order to understand this, we note that under the illumination  of 800 nm laser beam, a spin-polarized current is set up at the  interface of the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure due to the different  mobilities of the majority- and minority-spin sp-band electrons  in the Co layer.[20] Due to the existence of strong spin–orbit  coupling in Bi2Se3, the ultrafast injected spin current can be  converted to an ultrafast charge current via either the inverse  Edelstein effect (IEE) on the surface or the inverse spin Hall  effect (ISHE) in the bulk.[39–42] This SCC conversion process  can lead to the large-amplitude THz waveforms that we detect   from the TI/FM heterostructure.
We note that the SCC   transient charge currents generated by both IEE and ISHE   flow in the same direction—since  ˆ jj zz cc σ ∝ ×  in IEE[13,41,43] and  jc ∝ js × σ in ISHE,[39,42] where jc is the charge current, js is the  spin current, σ is the direction of the spin polarization, and ˆzz   is the unit vector normal to the TI/FM interface (which is par- allel to js).
As a result, the polarization of the emitted THz pulses  from both ISHE and IEE also point in the same direction.
To confirm the central role of SCC in the Bi2Se3/Co stack  THz emission, we oriented the magnetization in the Co layer  using an in-plane magnetic field—this enables the tuning of  the spin-polarization injected into the TI film.
As shown in  Figure 2c, the polarity of the emitted THz pulses reverses when  either (1) the direction of magnetic field was reversed, or when  (2) the pump beam was incident on the opposite side of the  heterostructure, as expected from SCC (IEE and/or ISHE) THz  emission mechanism.
While (1) displays the spin origin of the  Bi2Se3/Co stack THz emission, (2) displays its spin-current  dependence, since the spin current flips its direction relative to  the lab frame when the sample is pumped from the back.
Indeed, since the spin polarization σ is determined by the  external magnetic field, the abovementioned two SCC mecha- nisms also predict that the measured (x-projected) THz electric  field, obeys  | | sin THz E x x jjss σ φ ∝ × ∝ , where φ is the magnetic field  angle with respect to the positive x-axis.
As shown in Figure 2d,  the THz peak amplitude is locked to the magnetic field direc- tion and exhibits a onefold sinusoidal behavior, and allows  direct magnetic field control of THz emission.
This, therefore,  demonstrates a novel spin–charge dynamics that is enabled by  SCC in TI/FM heterostructures.
Pump-polarization-dependent measurements provide a fur- ther means of quantifying the contributions to the THz emis- sion from the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
In contrast to that  from pure Bi2Se3 films, we observe only small changes in the  amplitude and phase of the measured THz waveform as a  function of pump polarization angle, as shown in Figure 3a.
This is fully consistent with a dominant THz emission con- tribution from SCC that is independent of pump polariza- tion.[21–23] Figure 3b plots the THz electric field at t  =  0 ps as  a function of the pump polarization angle, showing a small- amplitude oscillation superposed on top of a large dc offset.
As  explained in the last section, the small-amplitude polarization- dependent contribution can be ascribed to the THz generation  from the Bi2Se3 film itself. Adv. Mater.

KGaA, Weinheim 1802356  (4 of 8) www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com On the basis of these characteristics, we can separate out  the THz waveform contributed by (a) the TI film alone (that is  via the shift-current mechanism), ETI(t), and (b) from SCC in  the TI/FM heterostructure, ESCC(t).
This is done by performing  for (a) ETI (t) = [E(t, θ  = 0°) −  E(t, θ  = 90°)]/2, and for (b)  ESCC (t) = [E(t, θ = 0°) + E(t, θ = 90°)] /2.
The resulting deline- ated THz waveforms are shown in Figure 3c.
For comparison,  the THz waveform emitted from pure 10-QL Bi2Se3 film is also  plotted.
Notice that in the Co/Bi2Se3 heterostructure, the THz  signal contributed by the shift-current mechanism is smaller  than that from pure Bi2Se3—this can be attributed to the reflec- tion or absorption of the 800 nm pump beam by the Co film.
The extracted TI component shows a very similar temperature  dependence to that of pure Bi2Se3 film, as shown in Figure S7  (Supporting Information), giving further evidence that they  share the same origin (Section S7, Supporting Information).
Interestingly, this delineation enables a temporal differ- ence between these two extracted THz waveforms to be  discerned—the SCC-component lags the TI-component (shift  current) by 0.12 ps.
This can be seen more clearly in the plot of  normalized THz waveforms in the inset of Figure 3c.
The significance of this delay can be appreciated by first  noting that to a good approximation, we can assume that the  800 nm light hits the surface of the Co and Bi2Se3 layer simul- taneously due to the ultrathin Co layer.
Upon optical excitation,  the shift current originates from the instantaneous shift of elec- tron density along the SeBi bond,[27] while it takes a longer  time to generate a spin current in the FM layer, diffuse into  the Bi2Se3 film, and then be converted to a charge current.[22,23] To quantify the spin transport in the FM layer, we vary the  Co thickness from 2 to 16 nm while keeping the thickness of   Bi2Se3 fixed at 10 QL.
The amplitude of the THz signal contri­ buted by the SCC component is maximum at 3 nm, and then  decreases with increasing Co thickness (see Figure S3 in the  Supporting Information), which we attribute to the smaller  amounts of 800 nm light reaching the Co/Bi2Se3 interface due  to the small penetration depth in Co (13  nm)[44] and hence  smaller injection of the laser-driven spin current.[22,23] Figure  3d   Adv.

This is consistent with the picture of  superdiffusive spin transport in Co, where the timescale of the  multiplication of carriers is only dependent on the material  (Section S4, Supporting Information).
Therefore, the tem- poral difference of ≈0.12 ps corresponds to the time needed for   the formation of a maximum charge current from the peak of  the laser pulse, and thus characterizes the SCC processes in the  Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure.
This value is of the same order as  that deduced by theoretical simulations of the spin dynamics  (0.1–0.3 ps) in heavy-metal/FM heterostructures.[22,23] In order to verify whether the observed SCC is dominated by  IEE on the surface or ISHE in the bulk, we perform measure- ments on different thicknesses of Bi2Se3 film while fixing the  Co thickness at 4 nm.
Figure 4a shows the THz peak amplitude  of the extracted SCC component as a function of Bi2Se3 thick- ness.
At 4 QL, the emitted THz signal is relatively small, while  it increases by about one order of magnitude as we go from 4 to  6 QL.
We see the same thickness dependence of THz emission  in pure Bi2Se3 films with thicknesses from 4 to 10 QL (shown in  Figure 1d), indicating therefore that the THz emission mecha- nism in TI/FM is also a surface-dominated response.
Although  the Bi2Se3 film may be doped by the metallic Co layer (Section S1,   Supporting Information), the dramatic enhancement of the  THz signal at 6 QL can be still ascribed to the formation of  gapless surface states,[24] as has been discussed earlier in pure  Bi2Se3 films.
On the other hand, if ISHE in the bulk were to play a major role  in THz emission of TI/FM heterostructures, the detected THz  signal can be written as  tanh( /2 ) THz sf sf E d x λ λ ∝ , where λsf is the  spin diffusion length and d is the thickness of Bi2Se3 film.[18,40,45] However, this spin diffusion model cannot account for the Bi2Se3  thickness dependence of THz peak amplitude (Section S5,   Supporting Information).
Therefore, we conclude that the SCC  processes in TI/FM heterostructures are dominated by the top- ological surface states, though we cannot completely exclude a  possible contribution from ISHE in the bulk.
For the thicker  samples (above 10 QL), the extracted THz signal decreases with  increasing thickness.
This probably originates from the carrier  absorption in the bulk since the THz transients are generated  at the interface of the heterostructure.
Figure 4a also shows the  electric-field transmittance of pure Bi2Se3 films at 1 THz (cor- responding to the peak of THz waveforms) upon optical excita- tion, which decreases with increasing film thickness (Section S6,  Adv. Mater.

The observed agreement between the  thickness dependence of the THz signal and the pump transmit- tance (for samples above 4 QL) suggests that the suppression of  the THz amplitude is attributed to the absorption of THz radia- tion by both the intrinsic bulk carriers and the photo-generated  free carriers in Bi2Se3 films.
We also investigated the temperature dependence of THz  emission from both the Bi2Se3 (10 QL) film and the Bi2Se3/ Co (4  nm) heterostructures with different Bi2Se3 thicknesses.
Cooling the pure Bi2Se3 film from room temperature down to  10 K increases the emitted THz signal, which we attribute to  a higher carrier mobility at low temperature (Section S7, Sup- porting Information).
In contrast, as shown in Figure 4b, the  THz peak amplitude of the extracted SCC component does not  change with temperature for four representative samples with dif- ferent Bi2Se3 thicknesses.
In this temperature range (10–300 K),   the spin diffusion length of the Co layer (38–59 nm) is much  larger than the thickness of Co layer used in our case,[46]  implying a constant spin current injection from the Co layer  into the TI at different temperatures.
Therefore, the tempera- ture-insensitive THz emission implies that the SCC efficiency  via IEE is also independent of temperature.
This is consistent  with previous work on the temperature evolution of IEE in  metallic Ag/Bi junctions.[47] In TIs, IEE originates from the spin- momentum-locked surface states, which is a result of strong  spin–orbit coupling.[1,2] As a relativistic effect, it is expected to be  temperature-independent.[48] Consequently, the resulting THz  signal contributed by the IEE should be temperature insensitive,  in good agreement with our experimental results, confirming  once again the dominant contribution from the topological   surface states to the observed SCC in TI/FM heterostructures.
The spin-momentum-locked topological surface states have  been predicted to possess superior SCC efficiency.[1,3,4] However,  previous reported values of the SCC efficiency exhibit a large  range over several orders of magnitude (from 10−4 to 0.8).[13–17] In order to evaluate the SCC efficiency in Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/ Co (3  nm) heterostructures, we compare its THz emission  amplitude to that from the Pt (2 nm)/Co (3 nm) bilayer struc- ture—we choose a Pt thickness of 2 nm to match a single TI  surface state thickness of t ≈  2 nm,[49,50] since SCC via IEE is  restricted to the top surface of Bi2Se3 in the heterostructure.
As shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), the THz   peak amplitude of Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3  nm) is 1.7 times of  that from Pt (2  nm)/Co (3  nm) under identical experimental  conditions.
Since the spin currents are generated by optically  exciting an out-of-equilibrium electron distribution in the Co  layer (Section S4, Supporting Information), it is reasonable to  assume that they have similar magnitudes in both heterostruc- tures.[20,22] Consequently, the effective SCC efficiency θeff  =  jc /js is a function only of charge current and hence THz signal  amplitude.
As a rough estimate, we use a measured spin Hall  angle of 0.03 for the 2 nm thick Pt film.[51–54] Thus, we obtain  θeff ≈ 0.03 × 1.7 ≈ 0.05 for 10-QL Bi2Se3 film.
Using  1 2 IEE eff t λ θ = ⋅  as defined in Equation S7 (Supporting Information) and  t ≈ 2 nm, we obtain the IEE length λIEE ≈ 50 pm charactering the  SCC efficiency of the surface states, which is in good agreement  with the spin-pumping measurements in TI/ferromagnetic- insulator heterostructures (35–76 pm).[18,19] Note that if we use a  larger measured spin Hall angle for the 2 nm thick Pt film,[51–54]  as well as include the interfacial spin transparency,[54–57] we will  obtain a larger SCC efficiency for Bi2Se3 (see Section S8 in the  Supporting Information for further discussion on these points).
Remarkably, the amplitude of the THz emission from the  Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3  nm) heterostructure is only slightly  smaller than that from the Pt (6  nm)/Co (3  nm) bilayer  structure (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information),  and the latter has been demonstrated to be a very efficient  broadband THz emitter comparable to the standard ZnTe  THz emitter.[21,23,58] In this regard, the temperature-insen- sitive SCC efficiency suggests promising applications of  topological surface states in THz spintronic devices at room  temperature.
In conclusion, we have systematically demonstrated, for the first  time, highly-efficient ultrafast spin-injection and spin-to-charge  conversion in topological-insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures  using THz emission spectroscopy.
Locked to the Co magnetiza- tion direction, THz emission from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures  far outstrips the emission of either Bi2Se3 or Co individually. Adv. Mater.

KGaA, Weinheim 1802356  (7 of 8) www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com This underscores the central role the novel TI spin–charge  dynamics play in response of the heterostructure.
While we have  focused on the THz response of Bi2Se3/Co to elucidate its SCC  dynamics, large nonequilibrium spin injection into a TI afforded  by our methodology unlocks easy access to a range of spin-type  responses previously difficult to realize in TIs, including tun- able generation of ultrafast spin and charge current in the bulk  and/or surface.
Perhaps most tantalizing is the fast timescale in   which efficient SCC in Bi2Se3 occurs within 0.12 ps.
This paves  the way for high speed and ultrathin optospintronic devices with  operating speeds up to several terahertz.
Experimental Section Sample Fabrication: High-quality thin films of the topological insulator  Bi2Se3 with thicknesses of 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 40 QLs were grown by  a two-step deposition process using MBE on c-axis Al2O3 substrate  (0.5 mm).
The samples were transferred through air into the sputtering  chamber for capping layer and magnetic layer deposition.
For pure Bi2Se3  films, the samples were protected by a SiO2 capping layer (4 nm).
For  the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures, a nanometer-thick Co layer (2–16  nm)  was deposited onto the Bi2Se3 films by sputtering and then capped with  the same SiO2 capping layer to prevent oxidation of the magnetic layer.
For comparison, a pure Co layer (3 nm) on an Al2O3 substrate with the  same capping layer was also prepared.
Please see Section S1 in the  Supporting Information for more sample information.
THz Emission Setup: A Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Coherence  Legend; center wavelength 800 nm; duration 50 fs; repetition rate 1 kHz)  was employed in this work.
The beam was split into two parts: one for  the pump beam and the other one for THz detection, by an optical beam  splitter.
The pump beam with an incident power of 60 mW and a spot  size 7 mm (0.156 mJ cm−2) impinged on the samples at normal incidence  from the sample side.
Any residual pump beam after the sample was  blocked by a piece of 1/16 inch thick high-density polyethylene, which is  transparent in the THz frequency range.
The THz pulses generated were  projected onto the x-axis (vertical) by using a wire-grid THz polarizer, and  then collected and focused by two parabolic mirrors onto a 1 mm thick  <110> ZnTe crystal for free-space electro-optic sampling.
A cryostat was  used in the temperature-dependent experiments, in which the magnets  were fixed along the y (horizontal) direction.
The remaining experiments  were performed at room temperature in a dry air atmosphere.
A half- wave plate and a pair of permanent magnets in the dipole configuration  were mounted on rotation stages to vary the polarization of pump pulses  and to align the magnetization of the Co layer, respectively.
A visible wire  grid polarizer for the 800 nm beam was placed before the half-wave  plate.
The magnetic field at the sample position was about 800 Oe.
