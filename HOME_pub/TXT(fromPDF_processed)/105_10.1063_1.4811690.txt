[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4811690] I. INTRODUCTION Understanding the magnetic properties of low- dimensional systems is one major issue for the future devel- opment of magneto-electronics devices with high areal density.
At low scale, the presence of magnetic domains plays a crucial role on the magnetic response of small ferromag- netic elements.1 Recent development of magnetic microscopy tools for the analysis of bulk materials as well as thin ﬁlms, surfaces, interfaces and nanostructures2 has allowed a direct comparison of micro- and nano-magnetic models with experi- ments, down to the nano-scale.
Among magnetic microscop- ies presenting high lateral resolution, the recently proposed Ballistic Electron Magnetic Microscopy (BEMM)3,4 appears promising due to some of its speciﬁc features.
In BEMM, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) non-magnetic tip is used to locally inject a hot electron current in a spin-valve grown on a semiconducting substrate.
The ballistic current IC collected in the semiconductor is modulated by the hot- electron giant magneto-resistance (GMR) effect, allowing magnetic imaging of the spin-valve domain structure.
BEMM is thus sensitive to the volume magnetism of thin ﬁlms and nanostructures and can be used to image the magnetic domain structure of buried ultrathin elements integrated in realistic magneto-resistive devices.
Although a measurement of the ultimate BEMM magnetic resolution is still missing, an upper bound of 28 nm was reported on p-doped samples,5 while a lateral resolution below 1 nm was reported in ballistic electron emission microscopy experiments on non-magnetic samples.6 Up to now, BEMM was quasi exclusively used to investigate magnetic domain structure or magnetization reversal process in planar spin-valves only.
Most of these studies were limited to a qualitative analysis of the parallel and anti-parallel magnetic domain evolution under applied ﬁeld, and only recently BEMM quantitative analysis of mag- netic domain walls proﬁles was reported.7,8 Despite the BEMM high lateral resolution, only one study was dedicated to the investigation of FeNi patterned magnetic nanostruc- tures.4 This is most likely due to the fact that classical UV or electron lithography is hardly compatible with the preserva- tion of a post-process surface cleanliness allowing stable STM/BEMM imaging conditions.
In this paper, we report on BEMM investigation of ultrathin epitaxial Fe(001) microstructures integrated in epitaxial Fe/Au/Fe/GaAs(001) spin-valves.
We use in situ shadow mask deposition to pat- tern elongated magnetic elements in the top Fe(001) spin- valve electrode.
Competition between shape anisotropy, magneto-crystalline anisotropy and exchange energy terms results in the formation of various magnetic domain struc- tures on the as-grown sample.
These various magnetic conﬁg- urations are reproduced by micromagnetic calculations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the calculated magnetiza- tion maps can be converted into simulated BEMM images.
An excellent agreement is obtained between simulated and measured BEMM images demonstrating the BEMM ability for quantitative magnetic imaging of micro/nanostructures.
Finally, we report observation of magnetic domain reversal under high injected current pulses.
This suggests that BEMM can also be used as a powerful experimental tool for the investigation of current-induced magnetization dynamics in micro/nanostructures.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Samples are prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
A 1.5 lm thick Si n-doped (4  1016 cm3) GaAs buffer layer is ﬁrst grown in a independent MBE chamber on a nþ-GaAs(001) substrate and protected by a 5 lm thick amorphous As capping layer to allow transfer under ambient atmosphere in the BEMM setup.
The ultra-high vacuum (UHV) BEMM setup,9 with a base pressure better than 1  1010mbar, consists of a metal MBE deposition chamber connected to the STM/BEMM microscope.
Thermal desorp- tion of the As protecting layer is ﬁrst done at 760 K, in front of a cryopanel cooled with liquid nitrogen, leading to the for- mation of a clean As(24)-reconstructed GaAs(001).
After sample cooling down to room temperature, MBE deposition of the Fe(1 nm)/Au(6 nm)/Fe(1.2 nm)/GaAs(001) spin-valve on the GaAs surface is performed by using two Knudsen cells.
Two levels of shadow-mask microstructuration are used during the spin-valve deposition process.
The bottom Fe electrode and the non-magnetic Au spacing layer are ﬁrst deposited through a shadow mask to form 400 lm diameter metallic dots on the GaAs(001) substrate.
This allows us to obtain highly resistive Au/Fe/GaAs(001) Schottky contacts (R > 10 MX at room temperature) for low-noise BEMM measurement.
The top Fe electrode of the spin-valve is ﬁnally patterned in an array of 1700  550 nm2 capsule- shaped elements via the nanostencil technique.10,11 The mask, a 900 nm thick silicon nitride membrane structured by focused ion beam, is gently brought into direct contact with the GaAs substrate, and deposition is performed with normal incidence to minimize blurring of the structure edges.
In the following, all crystalline directions will refer to crystal direc- tions of the GaAs(001) substrate.
The long axis of the Fe microstructure was aligned along [1–10].
Electrochemically etched W STM tips are cleaned in situ by thermal heating before the BEMM experiments.
The hot-electron current IC is collected at the back of the GaAs substrate using an in- dium ohmic contact.
A gold wire mounted on a translation motion and a gimbal tilter is used to ground selectively the surface of the 400 lm diameter isolated metallic dots12 in the STM/BEMM microscope head.
All STM/BEMM experi- ments are performed at room-temperature in the constant- current mode of operation, without applying any magnetic ﬁeld on the as grown spin-valve.
Micromagnetic simulations are performed using the freely available OOMMF package13 (Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework).
The Gilbert gyromagnetic ratio is set to 2.2  105 m/A/s and the damp- ing constant is kept large (a ¼ 0.5) to ensure fast simulation convergence.
The magnetic volume is discretized using a 2.5  2.5  1 nm3 cell.
The Fe stiffness constant is set to 1.13  1011 J/m14 and the saturation magnetization to 1720 kA/m. A slight uniaxial anisotropy energy contribution (with a [110] easy axis) is introduced as well as a biaxial anisotropy energy term ([100] and [010] easy axes) with respective magneto-crystalline anisotropy constants Ku ¼ 2.73 kJ/m3 and K1 ¼ 8 kJ/m3, as measured by magneto- optical Kerr effect on identical unpatterned Fe ﬁlm.
The resulting magnetic anisotropy deﬁnes two easy axes, respec- tively, 30 and 150 away from the [110] direction for an unpatterned planar top Fe electrode.
No magnetic coupling was considered vertically between both Fe(001) electrodes of the spin-valve due to the large Au spacer thickness nor lat- erally between neighboring dots. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fig. 1 displays STM images recorded at each step of an unpatterned epitaxial Fe(1 nm)/Au(6 nm)/Fe(1.2 nm)/ GaAs(001) spin-valve deposited at room temperature.
After the As capping layer thermal desorption, the GaAs(001) ini- tial surface is As-rich, and presents a disordered As(2  4) surface reconstruction, with As dimer lines running along the [1–10] GaAs crystal direction (Fig. 1(a)).
The obtained GaAs surface is atomically ﬂat over large areas, with a typi- cal atomic terraces size of 400 nm.
After deposition of the 1.2 nm thick Fe bottom electrode, a surface granular struc- ture is observed (Fig. 1(b)).
The surface is made of few nano- meter wide atomically ﬂat Fe 3D islands which appear slightly elongated along the [1–10] crystal direction.
Despite the small size of these Fe terraces, the resulting peak-to-peak FIG.

Deposition of the 6 nm thick Au spacer leads to a signiﬁcant smoothing of the sample surface (Fig. 1(c)), with Au atomic terraces expanding over 30 nm and presenting a (2  2) sur- face reconstruction.
This surface reconstruction is due to the segregation of roughly half a monolayer of As as conﬁrmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments.
As is well known to segregate from the GaAs surface during the Fe layer deposition15 and is further ﬂoating on the surface dur- ing the Au spacer deposition.
Finally, the top 1 nm thick Fe electrode presents a surface morphology similar to the ﬁrst electrode.
The obtained epitaxial relationship in the stack is Fe[100]//Au[110]//Fe[100]//GaAs[100] (Fig. 1(d)).
Fig. 2(a) displays a typical 1.4  1.4 lm2 large scale STM image of the ﬁnal spin-valve, with the top Fe electrode patterned by the nanostencil technique.
Atomic steps of the GaAs(001) substrate are observed after the spin-valve depo- sition.
One Fe(001) dot (top electrode) is observed with its long axis parallel to the [1–10] direction of the GaAs sub- strate.
The measured height of the Fe dot is 1.0 6 0.1 nm in agreement with its targeted thickness.
A line proﬁle over the Fe(001) dot edges shows an edge broadening with a width of 50 nm, typical of the nanostencil technique.
Fig. 2(b) presents the BEMM image recorded simultaneously with the STM image.
This image corresponds to a (80 pixels  80 pixels) grid of the hot electron current IC recorded over the (400 pixels  400 pixels) STM image.
Tunnel current was set to 20 nA and hot-electron energy to 2.1 eV in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
The magnetization of the bottom Fe electrode is parallel to the [110] direction of the substrate due to the strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy at the Fe/GaAs(001) interface,16 deﬁning the analyzer direction for the BEMM experiments.
On the BEMM image, a sequence of dark (low ballistic current) and bright (high ballistic current) areas are observed along the top Fe dot long axis, without any correlation with the surface morphology.
This contrast is from magnetic ori- gin and attributed to the presence of four magnetic domains in the microstructure.
The corresponding magneto-current (MC) at 2.1 eV between dark and bright BEMM areas (deﬁned as ICðbrightÞICðdarkÞ ICðdarkÞ ) is of 115%.
This value is smaller than the MC amplitude measured on an identical unpatterned planar spin-valve (MC180 ¼ 260% of relative change of the BEMM current at 2.1 eV, between a strictly parallel and strictly anti-parallel magnetic conﬁguration of both Fe elec- trodes), suggesting that the magnetization rotation angle between dark and bright regions of Fig. 2(b) is smaller than 180. A halo of higher BEMM current is also observed all around the Fe(001) dot.
The width of this brighter area is of typically 80 nm and is thus related to the Fe wedge at the borders of the microstructure.
This wedge causes an increase of the hot-electron intensity due to the reduced Fe thickness crossed by the hot-electron beam.
The magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the Fe(001) layer, and thus the magnetization orientation close to the borders, is also modiﬁed when the ﬁlm thickness decreases from 1 to 0 nm.
A part of the halo can thereby also have a magnetic origin, but a clear descrip- tion of this speciﬁc part of the BEMM image is beyond the scope of this paper.
In the following, abrupt edges of the microstructure are considered for micromagnetic simulations.
Fig. 3(a) presents the calculated stable micromagnetic conﬁguration obtained for the Fe(001) capsule.
Before calcu- lation, the dot was arbitrarily initialized in a 4 magnetic domains conﬁguration with the magnetization lying along FIG.

The simula- tion stabilizes 94 Neel walls and the magnetization in the dot is 43 (respectively, 137) away from the [110] analyzer direction for the bright (respectively, dark) domains.
This is a consequence of the introduction of supplementary shape anisotropy by the patterning process: both easy axes of the system rotate by 13 in direction of the long axis of the microstructure.
For a quantitative comparison of the micro- magnetic simulation with BEMM experiments, we used the magnetization map of Fig. 3(a) as an input to simulate a BEMM image.
The hot-electron current depends on the angle h between the local magnetization of the Fe dot and analyzer direction with a sin2 h 2   law.17 We could thus com- pute the BEMM current at each cell of the OOMMF simula- tion by considering the angle h between local magnetization direction in the Fe dot and the reference [110] direction of the Fe bottom electrode.
The obtained simulated BEMM image (Fig. 3(b)) is nicely matching the experimental BEMM image of Fig. 2(b).
An experimental BEMM current proﬁle IC(x,y) across the 94 Neel wall was also extracted from Fig. 2(b) (dotted green arrow) and converted into an angular proﬁle h(x,y).
A quantitative agreement (Fig. 3(c)) is obtained with the micromagnetic simulation, without using any free parameter nor introducing any experimental broad- ening.
The measured width of the 94 domain wall is of 130 nm.
30 other identical Fe(001) dots were probed over the sample surface.
Only four kind of magnetic conﬁgurations were observed by BEMM, presenting 1, 2, 3, or 4 magnetic domains, as reported on Figs. 4(a)–4(d).
All the bright (respectively, dark) domains present the same IC values as the dark/bright areas of Fig. 2(b) and correspond once more to magnetization orientation 43 (respectively, 137) away from the [110] analyzer direction.
For all observed conﬁgu- rations, the number and position of magnetic domain walls in the microstructure do not show any obvious correlation with the underlying GaAs substrate atomic steps.
The do- main walls also do not present any important bowing.
We thus do not have experimental evidence of domain wall pin- ing by structural defects and consider that the observed magnetic conﬁgurations are among the lowest-energy conﬁg- urations of the magnetic phase diagram.
To check this point, we reproduced the observed conﬁgurations by micromag- netic calculations.
The microstructure was arbitrarily initial- ized in a conﬁguration with 1, 2, 3, or 4 magnetic domain with magnetization parallel to the easy axis of the Fe unpat- terned top electrode.
Except for the single domain case, cal- culations stabilized multi-domains structures separated by 94 domain walls.
The ﬁnal positions of the domain walls in the stable calculated magnetic conﬁgurations are in good agreement with the BEMM images of Figs. 4(a)–4(d).
The corresponding total magnetic energies are plotted in Fig. 5.
The 4 conﬁgurations which are experimentally observed by BEMM correspond to the lowest calculated magnetic ener- gies and the absolute minimum magnetic energy is obtained for the two domains structure.
The energy difference between the 1, 2, and 3 domains state is weak (0.03 kJ/m3 corresponding to 158 meV for one dot) and accounts for the majority presence of these conﬁgurations on the as-grown sample.
The 4-domains conﬁguration was observed only once over 30 sampled dots, which is coherent with its signiﬁ- cantly higher energy (551 meV higher than the 2-domains state).
Finally, some unexpected events were observed during the acquisition of the BEMM images.
Due to the high tunnel- ling current values (IT ¼ 20 nA) and tunnel bias used in the BEMM experiments, STM tip instabilities are common while scanning (mostly due to material exchange between tip and surface).
These instabilities are accompanied by local injection of intense tunnel current pulses (up to 200 nA) in the spin valve.
We noticed that when these current pulses were located inside the Fe dots, a sudden change in the BEMM signal (marked by arrows on Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)) was observed inside the magnetic microstructure, without any signal change outside the dot.
We checked that similar current pulses generated outside the Fe dots did not lead to any similar contrast changes.
This contrast change is thus FIG.

Various driving-forces can lead to current induced magnetic switching.
In our experiments, the Oersted ﬁeld locally generated during current injection can be estimated typically of the order of few ten of lT, i.e., of the same order of magnitude than earth magnetic ﬁeld.
The inﬂuence of this Oersted ﬁeld alone is thus questionable.
Local Joule heating of the sample can promote domain wall motion, when supplementary thermal energy allows detrap- ping of the domain wall from structural defects.
Recent spin- polarized experiments18 demonstrated that the Joule heating of a nanometric Fe/W(110) monoatomic island induced by electron tunnelling at 40 K led to a typical effective tempera- ture increase of 17 K/lW for a typical 4  4 nm2 island.
This would correspond in our experiments to an estimated upper bound for the local temperature increase under the STM tip of 1 K considering a 10  10 nm2 heat dissipation area.
This temperature increase is low compared to the thermal energy at room temperature.
Since we do not observe any thermal ﬂuctuation of the magnetic conﬁguration with a stable tip, the inﬂuence of the local Joule heating alone can be excluded.
Finally, spin-transfer torque effect can promote magnetization rotation induced by current pulses in such spin-valve structure.19 The current pulse during the tip insta- bility can potentially achieve a current density up to 1011 A.m2 (considering a 100 nA pulse over a 1  1 nm2 injection area) which is sufﬁcient for spin-transfer torque observation.
However, when the electron beam is ﬂowing from the free magnetic layer (microstructure) to the ﬁxed magnetic layer (bottom Fe electrode) the spin transfer torque effect should promote a switching towards the anti-parallel magnetic state of the spin-valve.
As can be seen in Fig. 6(b) , we observe both kinds of magnetic contrast inversions, either from the parallel to the anti-parallel state or vice versa.
From this very preliminary analysis, we can thus not clearly attrib- ute a unique and simple origin to the observed magnetization switching phenomenon.
A more complex combination of thermal, Oersted ﬁeld and spin-transfer torque effects may account for our observations, but further detailed experimen- tal investigations combined with micromagnetic simulations are necessary to conclude on this point.
However, these primary observations demonstrate the potential interest of BEMM for the investigation of current-induced magnetiza- tion dynamics. IV.
CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we observe by ballistic electron magnetic microscopy the magnetic domain structure of epitaxial Fe(001) sub-micron elements integrated in epitaxial Fe/Au/ Fe/GaAs(001) spin valve.
We take advantage of the high uni- axial magnetic anisotropy of the bottom Fe/GaAs(001) elec- trode to quantitatively analyze the magnetization orientation of the unknown Fe magnetic microstructure with respect to the [110] direction.
The large magneto-contrast between parallel and anti-parallel states of the spin-valve gives access to a large dynamical range of BEMM current for a 360 rotation of the magnetization.
Angular dependence of the magneto-contrast is used to convert micromagnetic simula- tions into simulated BEMM images in quantitative agree- ment with experiments.
A 13 rotation of the magnetic easy axes caused by shape anisotropy in the Fe(001) dots is deter- mined by BEMM.
The various magnetic conﬁgurations imaged by BEMM on the as-grown sample are ﬁnally match- ing the lowest energy states of the magnetic phase diagram for the system.
A further step of this BEMM study is to investigate in situ the magnetization reversal mechanisms of the microstructure, either by applying an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld on the sample, or by using the STM tip to locally gener- ate in a controlled manner high current density pulses.
