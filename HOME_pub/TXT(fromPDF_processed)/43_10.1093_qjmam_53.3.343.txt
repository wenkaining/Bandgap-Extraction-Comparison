FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES IN A DEFORMED MOONEY–RIVLIN MATERIAL by M. DESTRADE (Department of Mathematical Physics, University College Dublin, Belﬁeld, Dublin 4, Ireland) [Received 27 April 1999.
Revise 23 November 1999] Summary The propagation of ﬁnite-amplitude linearly-polarized inhomogeneous transverse plane waves is considered for a Mooney–Rivlin material maintained in a state of ﬁnite static homogeneous deformation.
It is shown that such waves are possible provided that the directions of the normal to the planes of constant phase and of the normal to the planes of constant amplitude are orthogonal and conjugate with respect to the B-ellipsoid, where B is the left Cauchy– Green strain tensor corresponding to the initial deformation.
For these waves, it is found that even though the system is nonlinear, results on energy ﬂux are nevertheless identical with corresponding results in the classical linearized elasticity theory.
Byproducts of the results are new exact static solutions for the Mooney–Rivlin material.
1. Introduction An isotropic homogeneous elastic material maintained in a state of arbitrary ﬁnite static homogeneous deformation exhibits three privileged orthogonal directions, namely those of the principal axes of strain.
For a general material held in such a state, Green (1) showed that transverse ﬁnite-amplitude homogeneous plane waves can travel in a principal direction and Carroll (2) showed that homogeneous transverse plane waves of ﬁnite amplitude, linearly-polarized in a principal direction, may propagate in a principal plane.
John (3) considered the possibility of having ﬁnite-amplitude plane waves propagating in any direction in a prestressed material; he showed that the so-called Hadamard material was the most general compressible one in which it may happen.
Then Currie and Hayes (4) extended his result to incompressible bodies and the corresponding material was found to be of the Mooney–Rivlin type, a model used to describe the mechanical behaviour of rubber (5).
Later, Boulanger and Hayes (6, 7) gave a detailed study of ﬁnite-amplitude waves propagating in a deformed Mooney–Rivlin material.
For these waves, the displacement is of the form g(n · x −vt)a, where g is a function of arbitrary magnitude, n is a unit vector in the direction of propagation (which may be any direction), v is the speed at which the wave travels and a is a unit vector in the direction of polarization.
In contrast to this type of wave, inhomogeneous plane waves have distinct planes of constant amplitude and of constant phase.
The purpose of this paper is to consider the superposition of an inhomogeneous motion upon an arbitrary static homogeneous deformation in a Mooney–Rivlin material.
We show that waves with displacement of the form f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a, where f and g are certain functions of ﬁnite magnitude and the vectors n and b satisfy a geometric relationship, may propagate in the deformed Mooney–Rivlin material, for any orientation of the plane of b and n.
The plan of the paper is as follows.
In section 2, we recall the basic equations describing the Mooney–Rivlin incompressible material.
In section 3, we assume that this material is subjected Q. Jl Mech. appl.
Math. (2000) 53 (3), 343–361 c⃝Oxford University Press 2000344 M. DESTRADE to a ﬁnite homogeneous static deformation, upon which a ﬁnite-amplitude linearly-polarized inhomogeneous plane wave is superposed.
The equations of motion are derived in section 4 and solved for the functions f and g, the speed v and the pressure.
Two types of solutions arise.
When the directions of a, b, and n are along principal axes of the initial strain ellipsoid, the solutions are called ‘special principal motions’ (section 5); when the orientation of the plane containing b and n is arbitrary, we show that these directions must be conjugate with respect to the elliptical section of the strain ellipsoid corresponding to the initial static deformation by the plane orthogonal to the direction of polarization (section 6).
In section 7, we study a class of solutions which are of interest in some physical contexts (gravity waves, surface waves, waves in layered media, interfacial waves, etc.).
For these solutions, the amplitude decays exponentionally in one direction while it varies sinusoidally with time in another.
We show how the possible directions of polarization, propagation and attenuation may be constructed geometrically, and give bounds for the values of the phase speed.
For these waves, the propagation of energy is also considered.
Although the theory is nonlinear, well-known aspects of the linearized theory of wave propagation in conservative media are recovered.
In particular, it is shown that the direction of the mean energy ﬂux vector is parallel to the planes of constant amplitude, and that the component of this vector in the direction of propagation is equal to the phase speed times the total energy density.
Finally, in section 8, we investigate the case where the time dependency of the superposed deformation is removed.
The corresponding solutions provide examples of inhomogeneous ﬁnite static deformations possible in a Mooney–Rivlin material, in the absence of body forces. 2.
Basic equations Here we recall the basic equations governing the deformation of Mooney–Rivlin rubberlike materials.
The constitutive equation for a Mooney–Rivlin material is T = −p1 + (C + DI)B −DB2 = −(p −DII)1 + CB −DB−1.
(2.1) Here T is the Cauchy stress, C and D are constants, B is the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor deﬁned by B = FFT, where F = ∂x/∂X is the deformation gradient, and the deformation is x = x(X, t).
Also, I and II are invariants of B, given by I = tr B and II = tr B−1.
In the constitutive equation (2.1), p(x, t) corresponds to an arbitrary pressure.
Because the material is incompressible, we must have det F = 1.
(2.2) For this material, the strain energy density 	, measured per unit volume in the current state of deformation, has the form (5) 2	 = C(I −3) + D(II −3).
(2.3) It is assumed that C ⩾0, D > 0, or C > 0, D ⩾0, (2.4) in order that the strong ellipticity condition be satisﬁed (see (7) for a short proof).
If D = 0, theFINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 345 material is said to be neo-Hookean which case is being examined elsewhere.
Here we exclude this possibility, that is we assume that (2.4)1 holds.
The equations of motion in the absence of body forces are div T = ρ ∂2x ∂t2 , ∂Ti j ∂x j = ρ ∂2xi ∂t2 , (2.5) where ρ is the mass density of the material, measured per unit volume in any conﬁguration (because of the incompressibility constraint).
The energy ﬂux vector R is deﬁned by R = −T · ˙x, Ri = −Ti j ˙x j, (2.6) where ˙x is the particle velocity.
We write Rα for the rate at which the mechanical energy crosses, at time t, a material element which is normal to the xα-axis at time t, in the ﬁnal state of deformation, measured per unit area of surface in this conﬁguration.
Also, the kinetic energy density K measured per unit volume is given by K = 1 2ρ(˙x · ˙x). (2.7) 3.
Motion superposed on static homogeneous deformation Here we consider the propagation of a linearly-polarized inhomogeneous plane wave of ﬁnite amplitude in the material, when it is held in a state of ﬁnite static homogeneous deformation.
We determine the corresponding stresses and energy ﬂux for the motion.
We assume that the material is held in the state of ﬁnite static homogeneous deformation given by xα = λα Xα, α = 1, 2, 3, (3.1) in which the particle initially at position X is displaced to x.
The constants λ1, λ2, λ3 are such that λ1 > λ2 > λ3 > 0 and satisfy λ1λ2λ3 = 1, due to (2.2).
In this case, the principal stresses tα, necessary to support the deformation are given by tα = −p0 + (C + DI)λ2 α −Dλ4 α, α = 1, 2, 3, (3.2) where now I = λ2 1 + λ2 2 + λ2 3 and p0 is a constant.
Let a linearly-polarized inhomogeneous plane wave of ﬁnite amplitude propagate in the deformed body, so that the ﬁnal position of the particle, which is initially at X, and at x in the state of ﬁnite static homogeneous deformation, is at x where x = x + f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a.
(3.3) Here, (n, a, b) form an orthonormal triad.
The planes deﬁned by n · x = const.
are the planes of constant phase and those deﬁned by b · x = const.
are the planes of constant amplitude.
Also, v is the real speed of propagation and ( f, g) are two real functions to be determined.
We use bars, for example W, to denote quantities in the ﬁnal state of deformation.
The deformation gradient F associated with the deformation (3.3) is given by F = ∂x ∂X = [1 + f ′g a ⊗b + f g′ a ⊗n]F, (3.4)346 M. DESTRADE where a prime denotes the derivative of a function with respect to its argument.
The corresponding left Cauchy–Green tensor B = F F T and its inverse B −1 = F −1T F −1 are B = [1 + f ′g a ⊗b + f g′ a ⊗n]B[1 + f ′g b ⊗a + f g′ n ⊗a], B −1 = [1 −f ′g b ⊗a −f g′ n ⊗a]B−1[1 −f ′g a ⊗b −f g′ a ⊗n].
(3.5) Also, the invariants of B are given by I = tr B = I + 2[ f ′g(a · Bb) + f g′(a · Bn)] + ( f ′g)2(b · Bb) + 2 f f ′gg′(n · Bb) + ( f g′)2(n · Bn), II = tr B −1 = II −2[ f ′g(a · B−1b) + f g′(a · B−1n)] + [( f ′g)2 + ( f g′)2](a · B−1a).
(3.6) We introduce the coordinates (η, ξ, ζ), given by η = n · x, ξ = a · x, ζ = b · x, (3.7) and the coordinates (η, ξ, ζ), given by η = n · x = η, ξ = a · x = ξ + f (ζ)g(η −vt), ζ = b · x = ζ.
(3.8) Now we write the Cauchy stress tensor T in (n, a, b).
For a Mooney–Rivlin material, the stress– strain relation is given by equation (2.1) or, in the present context, by T = −(p −DII)1 + CB −DB −1, (3.9) where the arbitrary pressure p may be decomposed into the pressure p0 corresponding to the primary homogeneous deformation and an incremental pressure p∗(say) corresponding to the superposed dynamic deformation: p = p0 + p∗. We assume p∗to be of a form similar to the superposed motion (3.3); that is, p∗= p∗(n · x, b · x, t) = p∗(η, ζ, t).
Using (3.5), (3.6), (3.9), and the notation: Tηη = n · Tn, Tηξ = n · Ta, etc., the components of T are found to be Tηη = Tηη −p∗−2Df ′g(a · B−1b) + D( f ′g)2(a · B−1a), Tηξ = Tηξ + C[ f g′(n · Bn) + f ′g(n · Bb)] + D( f g′)2(a · B−1a), Tηζ = Tηζ + D[ f ′g(a · B−1n) + f g′(a · B−1b)] −Df f ′gg′(a · B−1a), Tξξ = Tξξ −p∗+ 2C[ f ′g(a · Bb) + f g′(a · Bn)] (3.10) + C [( f ′g)2(b · Bb) + 2 f f ′gg′(n · Bb) + ( f g′)2(n · Bn)], Tξζ =Tξζ + C[ f ′g(b · Bb) + f g′(n · Bb)] + Df ′g(a · B−1a), Tζζ =Tζζ −p∗−2Df g′(a · B−1n) + D( f g′)2(a · B−1a).
In passing, we introduce some quantities associated with the energy carried by the distur- bance (3.3).
First, from (2.7) and (3.3), the kinetic energy density K per unit volume is given by K = 1 2ρv2( f g′)2.
(3.11)FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 347 Next, the stored-energy density W per unit volume associated with the wave is deﬁned, in the absence of body forces, by W = 	 −	 = 1 2C(I −I) + 1 2 D(II −II), (3.12) where I and II are given by (3.6) in our context.
Finally, we introduce the energy ﬂux vector R associated with the motion (3.3).
From (2.6) it is given here by R = −T · ˙x.
It is related to the energy ﬂux vector R measured in the intermediate static state of deformation through (8) R = ∂x ∂x −1 R = − ∂x ∂x −1 T · ˙x.
(3.13) Using (3.3) we have ∂x/∂x = 1 + f ′ga ⊗b + f g′a ⊗n, so that R = v( f g′)[1 −f ′ga ⊗b −f g′a ⊗n]T · a. (3.14) 4.
Equations of motion The equations of motion (2.5) are written as div T = ρ ∂2x ∂t2 , ∂Ti j ∂x j = ρ ∂2xi ∂t2 .
(4.1) Here div represents the divergence operator with respect to position x, that is, with respect to the coordinates (η, ξ, ζ) = (η, ξ, ζ).
However, by inspection of equations (3.10), we see that T depends on η, ζ and t only, so that div T computed with respect to x is equal to div T computed with respect to x.
Hence the equations of motion reduce to Tηη,η + Tηζ,ζ = 0, Tξη,η + Tξζ,ζ = ρv2 f g′′, (4.2) Tζη,η + Tζζ,ζ = 0, or −p∗ ,η + D[ f ′′g(a · B−1n) −f ′g′(a · B−1b)] + D( f ′2 −f f ′′)gg′(a · B−1a) = 0, C[ f ′′g(b · Bb) + 2 f ′g′(n · Bb) + f g′′(n · Bn)] + D( f ′′g + f g′′)(a · B−1a) = ρv2 f g′′, −p∗ ,ζ + D[ f g′′(a · B−1b) −f ′g′(a · B−1n)] + D(g′2 −gg′′) f f ′(a · B−1a) = 0, (4.3) where commas denote differentiation with respect to the coordinates (η, ξ, ζ); thus, for example, Tζξ,ξ = ∂Tζξ/∂ξ.
Now, equation (4.3)2 is equivalent to [C(b · Bb) + D(a · B−1a)] f ′′g + 2C(n · Bb) f ′g′ + [C(n · Bn) + D(a · B−1a) −ρv2] f g′′ = 0.
(4.4)348 M. DESTRADE Also, the second derivatives of p∗must be compatible, that is p∗ ,ηζ = p∗ ,ζη, or, from (4.3)1,3, f ′′′g(a · B−1n) −f ′′g′(a · B−1b) + ( f ′ f ′′ −f f ′′′)gg′(a · B−1a) = f g′′′(a · B−1b) −f ′g′′(a · B−1n) + (g′g′′ −gg′′′) f f ′(a · B−1a).
(4.5) Equations (4.4) and (4.5) are the two equations to be solved for f and g in order that the inhomogeneous motion (3.3) may propagate in the deformed Mooney–Rivlin material.
The solutions are established in Appendix A, and a distinction needs be made, according as to whether or not the orthogonal vectors n, a and b are along the principal axes of the B-ellipsoid. 5.
Special principal motions Here we present solutions valid when n, a, and b are in the principal directions of the initial strain ellipsoid.
For small-amplitude homogeneous plane waves propagating in a homogeneously deformed body, the term ‘principal wave’ (9) is used to describe a wave travelling along a principal axis of the strain ellipsoid corresponding to the initial static deformation.
This terminology can readily be extended to the case of inhomogeneous motions for which the planes of constant phase are orthogonal to such an axis.
We introduce the term ‘special principal motion’ to describe an inhomogeneous motion for which the normal to the planes of constant phase, the normal to the planes of constant amplitude, and the linear polarization are in the directions of the principal axes of strain.
With our notation, a special principal motion is of the form f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a where n, a, and b are the vectors i, j, and k. The most general functions f and g , solutions to the equations of motion (4.4) and (4.5), where, without loss of generality, n = i, a = j, and b = k, are such that one is of exponential type while the other is of sinusoidal type (see proof in Appendix A).
For these motions, the quantity v may be arbitrarily prescribed (within an interval).
Explicitly, the possible inhomogeneous special principal motions of the Mooney–Rivlin material are written as x = λ1X, y = λ2Y + f (λ3Z)g(λ1X −vt), z = λ3Z, (5.1) where either f (λ3Z) = f (z) = a1ekσz + a2e−kσz, g(λ1X −vt) = g(x −vt) = d1 cos k(x −vt) + d2 sin k(x −vt),  (5.2) or f (λ3Z) = f (z) = a1 cos kσz + a2 sin kσz, g(λ1X −vt) = g(x −vt) = d1ek(x−vt) + d2e−k(x−vt).
 (5.3) Here, a1, a2, d1, d2 are constants, σ is deﬁned by σ =  (Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 −v2)/(Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 ), (5.4) and k and v are arbitrary (0 ⩽v2 < Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 ).FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 349 6.
General solutions Here, we seek the most general solutions f and g of equation (4.4) satisfying (4.5) such that f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a is an inhomogeneous motion in the deformed Mooney–Rivlin material, (a, n, b) form an orthonormal triad, and the plane of n and b is arbitrary.
It is shown in Appendix A that f and g are the functions deﬁned by either f (ζ) = a1ekζ + a2e−kζ, g(η −vt) = d1 cos k(η −vt) + d2 sin k(η −vt),  (6.1) or f (ζ) = a1 cos kζ + a2 sin kζ, g(η −vt) = d1ek(η−vt) + d2e−k(η−vt).
 (6.2) Here a1, a2, d1, d2 and k are arbitrary constants, v is such that ρv2 = C[(n · Bn) −(b · Bb)], (6.3) and the condition b · Bn = 0, (6.4) must be satisﬁed.
The condition (6.4) means that the unit vectors n and b are conjugate with respect to the B- ellipsoid, deﬁned by x · Bx = 1.
Because they are orthogonal, they must lie along the principal axes of the elliptical section of the B-ellipsoid by the plane orthogonal to a.
We note that the speed v given by (6.3) is real when ˆm and ˆn are in the directions of the minor and major axes of the elliptical section, respectively.
Also note that ρv2 = n · Tn −b · Tb − b · Tn b · B−1n (n · B−1n −b · B−1b), (6.5) so that the speed may be written in terms of the basic strain B and the corresponding basic stress T. Finally, using the compatibility equations, the incremental pressure p∗is determined.
To within an arbitrary constant, it is found to be either p∗= −D[ f g′(a · B−1n) + f ′g(a · B−1b)] + 1 2 Dk2[(d2 1 + d2 2) f 2 −4a1a2g2](a · B−1a), (6.6) when f and g are given by (6.1), or p∗= −D[ f g′(a · B−1n) + f ′g(a · B−1b)] + 1 2 Dk2[4d2 1d2 2 f 2 −(a2 1 + a2 2)g2](a · B−1a), (6.7) when f and g are given by (6.2).
Thus, a ﬁnite displacement of the form f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a, where (a, b, n) is an orthonormal basis, f and g are given by (6.1) or (6.2), v is given by (6.3), and b, n satisfy (6.4), is an exact solution to the equations of motion in a homogeneously deformed Mooney–Rivlin material, for any orientation of the plane of b and n.350 M. DESTRADE 7.
Sinusoidal evanescent waves In this section, we restrict our attention to the propagation of a linearly-polarized ﬁnite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane wave in a homogeneously deformed Mooney–Rivlin material.
The phase of the wave ﬂuctuates sinusoidally in the direction of a unit vector n, its amplitude decreases exponentionally in the direction of b, orthogonal to n, and its polarization is in the direction of a, orthogonal to both n and b.
These waves are a subclass of the general solutions to the equations of motion found in the previous section, and arise in a variety of contexts such as Rayleigh waves, Love waves, Stoneley waves, etc.
We give a geometrical construction for the triads (n, a, b) such that the wave may propagate, and present expressions for the phase speed and the pressure.
Then we examine the propagation of the energy carried by the wave.
7.1 Construction Henceforth, we consider the motion x = x + αe−kb·xa cos k(n · x −vt), (7.1) where α and k are real arbitrary constants, and v is assumed to be real.
Recall that in (7.1), x corresponds to the static homogeneous predeformation x = diag(λ1, λ2, λ3)X.
As proved in section 6, this motion is possible as long as n and b are along the minor and major axes of the elliptical section of the B-ellipsoid by the plane orthogonal to a, respectively.
Boulanger and Hayes (6) considered the propagation of ﬁnite-amplitude homogeneous plane waves in a deformed Mooney–Rivlin material and found that it was possible in any direction of propagation along n.
Here, we deal with ﬁnite amplitude inhomogeneous plane waves and it is the plane of n and b (propagation and attenuation directions) that may be arbitrarily prescribed.
Thus we construct a sinusoidal evanescent inhomogeneous plane wave as follows.
First, consider any plane passing through the origin.
Let n and b be unit vectors along the respective major and minor axes of the elliptical section of the B-ellipsoid by the chosen plane.
Then the motion (7.1) is possible in the deformed Mooney–Rivlin material, with a linear polarization in the direction of a = b ∧n, an amplitude exponentially attenuated by factor k in the direction of b, and a velocity vn, where ρv2 = C[(n · Bn) −(b · Bb)].
In order to write explicit expressions for the directions of n and b, and for the value of ρv2, we use a method developed by Boulanger and Hayes (10, section 5.7).
First we prescribe a plane cutting the B-ellipsoid in a central elliptical section.
We denote by a the unit vector normal to this plane.
Then we write the Hamiltonian cyclic decomposition of the tensor B as (10, section 3.4) B = λ2 1 i ⊗i + λ2 2 j ⊗j + λ2 3 k ⊗k (7.2) = λ2 2 1 + 1 2(λ2 1 −λ2 3)(m+ ⊗m−+ m−⊗m+), where the unit vectors m± are in the directions of the ‘optic axes’ of the B-ellipsoid and are deﬁned by  λ2 1 −λ2 3 m± =  λ2 1 −λ2 2 i ±  λ2 2 −λ2 3 k. (7.3) We now seek n and b, unit vectors in the directions of the principal axes of the elliptical section of the B-ellipsoid by the plane a · x = 0.
Hence, n and b are eigenvectors of the tensor B whereFINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 351 , the orthogonal projection upon the plane a · x = 0, is deﬁned by  = 1 −a ⊗a.
With the aid of (7.2), and because 2 = , we have B = λ2 2  + 1 2(λ2 1 −λ2 3)(m+ ⊗m−+ m−⊗m+).
(7.4) Calling ψ± the angles between the polarization direction a and the optic axes m± (0 ⩽ψ± ⩽π), and noting that the vectors m±/ sin ψ± are of unit length, we ﬁnd from (7.4) that m+/ sin ψ+± m−/ sin ψ−are eigenvectors of B with eigenvalues γ ± given by (10, section 5.7) γ ± = λ2 2 + 1 2(λ2 1 −λ2 3)(m+ · m−± sin ψ+ sin ψ−).
(7.5) Recall that the phase speed v, which is given by equation (6.3), ρv2 = C(n · Bn −b · Bb) = C(n · Bn −b · Bb), (7.6) was assumed to be real.
Therefore, n is the eigenvector of B with the greater eigenvalue, which is γ + according to (7.5), and b is the eigenvector of B with the lesser eigenvalue γ −.
Hence, we obtain the propagation and attenuation directions as n = m+/ sin ψ+ + m−/ sin ψ−, n · Bn = γ +, b = m+/ sin ψ+ −m−/ sin ψ−, b · Bb = γ −. (7.7) 7.2 Phase speed and pressure We now write the phase speed in terms of the initial stretches and the angles ψ±.
Upon using (7.5) and (7.7), we have ρv2 = C(λ2 1 −λ2 3) sin ψ+ sin ψ−. (7.8) In this connection, it may be noted that for ﬁnite-amplitude homogeneous plane waves propagating in a homogeneously deformed Mooney–Rivlin material, two linearly-polarized waves exist for each direction of propagation, and the difference between the two corresponding squared speeds is proportional to (λ2 1 −λ2 3) sin φ+ sin φ−, where φ± are the angles between the propagation direction and the optic axes of the B−1-ellipsoid (also called the ‘acoustic axes’) (6).
From (7.8), it follows that the minimum value of v is vmin given by v2 min = 0, (7.9) and is attained only when a = m±.
In this case, n · Bn = b · Bb = λ2 2, and the plane orthogonal to a is a plane of central circular section of the B-ellipsoid.
In other words, when the plane of n and b is prescribed to be orthogonal to an optic axis of the B-ellipsoid, the superposed deformation must be static.
We treat this case in section 8.
The maximum value for the phase speed is vmax given by ρv2 max = C(λ2 1 −λ2 3), (7.10) which is attained when a = j.
In that case, n = i and b = k.
In other words, the fastest wave occurs for propagation in the direction of the greatest initial stretch.
A similar result was established by Ericksen (11) for acceleration waves in a homogeneously deformed neo-Hookean material and also352 M. DESTRADE by Boulanger and Hayes (7) for ﬁnite-amplitude homogeneous waves in a homogeneously deformed Mooney–Rivlin material.
We may also write the phase speed in terms of the polarization direction a alone.
Because n · Bb = 0 and det B = 1, we have a · B−1a = (n ∧b) · B−1(n ∧b) = (n ∧b) · (Bn ∧Bb) (7.11) = (n · Bn)(b · Bb).
Writing the trace of B in the (a, n, b) basis yields tr B = a · Ba + n · Bn + b · Bb. (7.12) Combining (7.11) and (7.12), we see that n · Bn and b · Bb are the two roots of the following quadratic in r (say), r2 + [tr B −a · Ba]r + a · B−1a = 0, (7.13) so that, using (6.3), v is alternatively given by ρv2 = C  [tr B −(a · Ba)]2 −4(a · B−1a).
(7.14) Finally, the pressure p∗is given by p∗= αkDe−b·x[(a · B−1n) sin k(n · x −vt) + (a · B−1b) cos k(n · x −vt)] + 1 2α2k2De−2kb·x(a · B−1a).
(7.15) 7.3 Energy propagation Here we consider the energy carried by the wave (7.1).
First we compute the total energy density, which is the sum of the kinetic and stored-energy densities, and then the energy ﬂux vector.
Our aim is to ﬁnd a relationship between these two quantities, or more relevantly (as the frequencies of the sinusoidal vibrations may be very high), between the temporal mean values of these quantities.
To this effect, we introduce the following notation to designate temporal mean values: if D(x, t) is a periodic ﬁeld quantity with frequency ω, then its mean value is ˇD, deﬁned by ˇD = ω 2π  ω/(2π) 0 D(x, t) dt.
(7.16) We begin with the kinetic energy density per unit volume K given by equation (3.11).
Using (7.1), its mean value ˇK is found to be ˇK = 1 4α2k2e−2kb·xρv2 = 1 4α2k2e−2kb·xC[(n · Bn) −(b · Bb)].
(7.17) The stored-energy density W per unit volume associated with the wave is given by (3.12), where I and II are given, for the motion (7.1), by I = I −2αke−kξ[cos k(n · x −vt)(a · Bb) + sin k(n · x −vt)(a · Bn)] + α2k2e−2kξ[cos2 k(n · x −vt)(b · Bb) + sin2 k(n · x −vt)(n · Bn)], II = II + 2αke−kξ[cos k(n · x −vt)(a · B−1b) + sin k(n · x −vt)(a · B−1n)] + α2k2e−2kξ(a · B−1a).
(7.18)FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 353 Note that because the material is incompressible, the stored-energy density W is the same whether it is measured in the reference conﬁguration, in the state of static homogeneous deformation, or in the current conﬁguration.
The mean value of this quantity is ˇW, given by ˇW = 1 4α2k2e−2kb·x[C(n · Bn + b · Bb) + 2D(a · B−1a)].
(7.19) We can now compute the total energy density E, which is by deﬁnition the sum of the kinetic and stored-energy densities: E = K + W. Using (7.17) and (7.19), we write directly the mean value ˇE of the total energy density E as ˇE = 1 2α2k2e−2kb·x[C(n · Bn) + D(a · B−1a)].
(7.20) Now we turn our attention to the energy ﬂux vector, deﬁned in equation (3.14), and ﬁnd that here, R is given by R = −αvke−kb·x sin k(n · x −vt){Ta −1 2α2k2De−2kb·x(a · B−1a)a −αk[CBb + D(a · B−1a)n]e−kb·x cos k(n · x −vt) −αk[CBn + D(a · B−1a)n]e−kb·x sin k(n · x −vt)}.
(7.21) The mean value of R is ˇR, given by ˇR = 1 2α2k2ve−2kb·x[CBn + D(a · B−1a)n].
(7.22) Hence, using equation (6.4), we see that ˇR · b = 0, (7.23) which means that the direction of the mean energy ﬂux vector is parallel to the planes of constant amplitude.
We also have, using (7.20), ˇR · (v−1n) = ˇE, (7.24) which means that the component of the mean energy ﬂux vector in the direction of propagation is equal to the phase speed times the total energy density.
These results may be compared with results established previously.
First, Schouten (12, section VII.7) introduced the notion of an energy ﬂux vector for the propagation of elastic waves in anisotropic elastic media.
For small homogeneous displacements (that is for displacements of the form a cos(kx −vt), where the real vector a is of inﬁnitesimal magnitude), he proved that the temporal mean values of the energy ﬂux vector and energy densities are related through the same equation as (7.24).
Then Synge (13) looked for solutions to the equations of motion in an anisotropic medium in the form {Aeiω(S·x−t) + c.c.} where A = A+ + iA−and S = S+ + iS−are complex vectors, ω is the real frequency and c.c. denotes the complex conjugate.
He proved that ˇR · S−= 0 and ˇR · S+ ⩾0, where ˇR is the time-averaged energy ﬂux vector.
Then Hayes (14) showed for any linear conservative system, using the same notation as above, that ˇR · S−= 0 and ˇR · S+ = ˇE, where ˇE is the mean energy density carried by the wave.
In354 M. DESTRADE that paper, no assumption is made as to whether or not the medium is anisotropic or subject to an internal constraint such as incompressibility or inextensibility.
Later, Chadwick et al. (15) and Borejko (16) described the dynamics of small amplitude plane waves superposed upon a large homogeneous deformation of a constrained material, be they homogeneous (15) or inhomogeneous (16).
In order to remain consistent with results of linear elastodynamics, these authors (following Lighthill (17)) separated energy quantities into ‘interaction’ and ‘incremental’ parts.
The former terms refer to the interconnection between the primary static stretch and the superposed waves, whereas the latter refer to the waves only, and would not disappear in the absence of prestress.
This distinction made, they proved that ˇRincr · S−= 0 and ˇRincr · S+ = ˇEincr, where the superscript ‘incr’ is short for ‘incremental’.
These results are all similar to those given by (7.23) and (7.24) because, in our context, the displacement x −x may also be written in the form {Aeiω(S·x−t) + c.c.}, with A = αa/2, ω = vk and S = v−1(n + ib).
With this notation, (7.23) and (7.24) are rewritten as ˇR · S−= 0 and ˇR · S+ = ˇE respectively.
However, the above mentioned studies are situated within the framework of linearized theory and it is remarkable that results such as (7.23) and (7.24) may be found in the nonlinear case of a ﬁnite- amplitude wave propagating in a ﬁnitely deformed Mooney–Rivlin material.
Note that in the same context, Boulanger and Hayes (7) found (7.24) for ﬁnite-amplitude homogeneous plane waves.
8. Superposed static deformation An interesting feature of inhomogeneous plane motions is that for certain orientations of the planes of constant phase and constant amplitude, the speed v may be equal to zero (10, section 6.3).
In this situation, no perturbation propagates, but the static deformation f (b · x)g(n · x)a may nevertheless be superposed upon the primary homogeneous one.
This possibility provides new exact solutions to the equations of equilibrium in a Mooney–Rivlin material.
Here, we consider in turn the case of special and non-special principal inhomogeneous deformations.
8.1 Superposed displacements along principal axes of the B-ellipsoid For special principal motions, we saw in section 5 that the quantity v can be prescribed within the interval 0 ⩽v2 < (Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 )/ρ.
When we choose v to be zero, we obtain from (5.1) a possible static deformation of a Mooney–Rivlin material.
It is written as x = λ1X, y = λ2Y + f (λ3Z)g(λ1X), z = λ3Z, (8.1) where either f (λ3Z) = a1 exp k    	Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 λ3Z + a2 exp −k    	Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 λ3Z, g(λ1X) = d1 cos k(λ1X) + d2 sin k(λ1X),    (8.2) or f (λ3Z) = a1 cos k    	Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 λ3Z + a2 sin k    	Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 λ3Z, g(λ1X) = d1 exp k(λ1X) + d2 exp −k(λ1X).
   (8.3)FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 355 Here, a1, a2, d1, d2 and k are arbitrary constants.
The components of the Cauchy stress corresponding to these deformations are as follows: T11 = −p + Cλ2 1 −D[λ−2 1 + λ−2 2 ( f g′)2], T12 = (Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 ) f g′, T13 = −Dλ−2 2 f f ′gg′, T22 = −p + C[λ2 1( f g′)2 + λ2 2 + λ2 3( f ′g)2] −Dλ−2 2 , (8.4) T23 = (Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2 ) f ′g, T33 = −p + Cλ2 3 −D[λ−2 3 + λ−2 2 ( f ′g)2], where the pressure p is given either by p = 1 2 Dk2λ−2 2  (d2 1 + d2 2) f 2 −4 Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2  a1a2g2  , (8.5) when f and g are given by (8.2), or by p = −1 2 Dk2λ−2 2  4d2 1d2 2 f 2 − Cλ2 1 + Dλ−2 2 Cλ2 3 + Dλ−2 2  (a2 1 + a2 2)g2  , (8.6) when f and g are given by (8.3).
8.2 Superposed displacements in the planes of central circular section of the B-ellipsoid From section 6, we see that for certain choices of the orthogonal unit vectors n and b, the quantity v is equal to zero.
This is the case when the plane of the conjugate vectors n and b is a plane of central circular section of the B-ellipsoid because then, n · Bn = b · Bb = λ2 2 (see (10, section 5.7.1) for instance) and then, from equation (6.3), v = 0.
The vector a is one of the unit vectors m±, which are in the directions of the optic axes of the B-ellipsoid and are deﬁned by (7.3).
Also, (n, b) is any pair of orthogonal unit vectors in a plane of central circular section a · x = m± · x = 0.
To provide an illustrative example, we choose n = m± ∧j, b = j, and f (b · x)g(n · x) = αe−kb·x cos kn · x, where α is a constant.

Concluding remarks New solutions to the equations of motion and equilibrium in a deformed Mooney–Rivlin material have been obtained.
In the case of a ﬁnite exponential sinusoidal wave, the propagation of energy was examined and results formerly established within the framework of linearized elasticity were recovered, although the case of a ﬁnite motion is nonlinear.
The waves considered here are linearly-polarized and it ought to be noted that this is the only possibility of having ﬁnite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane waves propagating in a material (deformed or not) subjected to the constraint of incompressibility.
This is shown elsewhere (18).
Also, the planes of constant phase (orthogonal to n) were assumed to be at right angles with the planes of constant amplitude (orthogonal to b).
We show in Appendix B that for ﬁnite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane waves of complex exponential type, this condition must be satisﬁed.

APPENDIX A Solutions for a system of two linear differential equations involving two functions of independent variables Here, our aim is to ﬁnd the real functions f (ζ) and g(η −vt) satisfying (4.4) and (4.5), viz ρv2 b g f ′′ + 2C(n · Bb) g′ f ′ + ρ(v2 n −v2) g′′ f = 0, f ′′′g(a · B−1n) −f ′′g′(a · B−1b) + ( f ′ f ′′ −f f ′′′)gg′(a · B−1a) = f g′′′(a · B−1b) −f ′g′′(a · B−1n) + (g′g′′ −gg′′′) f f ′(a · B−1a),    (A.1) where ρv2 b = C(b · Bb) + D(a · B−1a), ρv2 n = C(n · Bn) + D(a · B−1a), (A.2) and B is the left Cauchy–Green strain tensor associated with an arbitrary triaxial stretch.
Also, f and g are required to be such that f (b · x)g(n · x −vt)a (where (a, n, b) is an orthonormal triad) is an inhomogeneous deformation.
A referee very kindly suggested that the use of a technique by Birkhoff (19) would lead to a simplier derivation of the results.
Accordingly, this approach is adopted here.
Assuming n · Bb ̸= 0, we can, following Birkhoff (19, p. 137), express (A.1)1 in the separated form 3  j=1 Fj(ζ)G j(χ) = 0, χ = η −vt, (A.3) where F1 = f ′′, F2 = f ′, F3 = f , and G1 = ρv2 b g, G2 = 2C(n · Bb) g′, G3 = ρ(v2n −v2) g′′.
The condition (A.3) is equivalent to the requirement that the vectors F = (F1, F2, F3) and G = (G1, G2, G3) be conﬁned to orthogonal subspaces.
Calling dim F and dim G the respective dimensions of the subspaces spanned by the F and G, we may have three possible cases: case (i).
dim F = dim G = 1; case (ii).
dim F = 1, dim G = 2; case (iii).
dim F = 2, dim G = 1.
We treat these cases in turn. Case (i).
The dimension of the subspace spanned by the F is 1 when F1, F2, F3, or equivalently f , f ′, f ′′ are proportional.
This is possible only when f (ζ) = Aeδζ , where A and δ are real constants.
Similarly, dim G = 1 yields g(η −vt) = Beϵχ for some real scalars B and ϵ.358 M. DESTRADE However, we now have f ga = AB exp[(ϵn+δb)·x−ϵvt)]a.
Hence, case (i) corresponds to a homogeneous motion and must be discarded in our context. Case (ii).
The condition dim F = 1 yields f (ζ) = Aeδζ , (A.4) where A and δ are real constants.
Then equation (A.1)1 reduces to ρ(v2 n −v2) g′′ + 2C(n · Bb)δ g′ + ρv2 bδ2 g = 0, (A.5) This is a linear homogeneous second order differential equation for g, with the following characteristic equation in r (say), ρ(v2 n −v2)r2 + 2C(n · Bb)δ r + ρv2 bδ2 = 0.
(A.6) If (A.6) has two distinct roots r1,r2 (say), then g is of the form g(χ) = Ber1χ + Cer2χ, (A.7) where B and C are constants ((B, C) ̸= (0, 0)).
Upon using (A.4) and (A.7), equation (A.1)2 yields a linear combination for the independent functions er1χ, er2χ, e2r1χ, e2r2χ, and e(r1+r2)χ.
Nullity for the coefﬁcient of e(r1+r2)χ yields r1 = −r2.
However, in that case we have g′′ −r2 1 g = 0, which, together with (A.5), implies that dim G = 1.
If (A.6) has a double root r (say), then g is of the form g(χ) = (B + Cχ)erχ, (A.8) where B and C are constants ((B, C) ̸= (0, 0)).
Substituting (A.4) and (A.8) into (A.1)2 yields a linear combination for the independent functions erχ, χerχ, e2rχ, and χe2rχ.
Nullity for the coefﬁcient of e2rχ yields C2r = 0, which is not possible in our context. Case (iii).
This case is similar to case (ii), where f , g, v2n −v2 and v2 b are replaced by g, f , v2 b and v2n −v2 respectively.
We conclude that when n · Bb ̸= 0, no f and g can be found such that f g a is an inhomogeneous deformation.
We must therefore assume that b · Bn = 0, (A.9) which means that the orthogonal unit vectors n and b are conjugate with respect to the B-ellipsoid.
Then, equation (A.1)1 reduces to v2 b v2n −v2 f ′′(ζ) f (ζ) = −g′′(η −vt) g(η −vt) = const. = ±k2 (say).
(A.10) Clearly, from (A.2) and the strong ellipticity condition (2.4)1, we have v2 b > 0 and v2n > 0.
Now, if v2 > v2n, then by (A.10), f ′′/f and g′′/g are constants of the same sign.
In this case, f and g would be of the same type (either both hyperbolic or both sinusoidal functions), and again this would lead to a homogeneous motion.
We assume therefore that 0 ⩽v2 < v2n.
Upon using (A.10), the remaining equation to be satisﬁed, (A.1)2, reduces to (v2 n −v2 b −v2)[ f ′g(a · B−1n) −f g′(a · B−1b)] = 0.
(A.11) Hence, there are two cases: (i) v2 ̸= v2n −v2 b and (ii) v2 = v2n −v2 b.FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 359 Case (i).
if v2 ̸= v2n −v2 b, then by (A.11), we have f ′(ζ) f (ζ) (a · B−1n) = g′(η −vt) g(η −vt) (a · B−1b) = const. = µ (say).
(A.12) Assuming µ ̸= 0, (A.12) yields (a · B−1n) ̸= 0, (a · B−1b) ̸= 0 and also (a · B−1n)2( f ′′/f ) = (a · B−1b)2(g′′/g) = µ2.
However, as noted above, f ′′/f and g′′/g must be constants of opposite signs for an inhomogeneous motion. Hence, µ = 0.
Then, by (A.12), (a · B−1n) = (a · B−1b) = 0, which, together with (A.9), implies that n, a and b are along principal directions.
In this case, the solutions are either exponential in space and sinusoidal in time, f (ζ) = a1 exp k    	v2n −v2 v2 b ζ + a2 exp −k    	v2n −v2 v2 b ζ, g(η −vt) = d1 cos k(η −vt) + d2 sin k(η −vt),    (A.13) or sinusoidal in space and exponential in time, f (ζ) = a1 cos k    	v2n −v2 v2 b ζ + a2 sin k    	v2n −v2 v2 b ζ, g(η −vt) = d1 exp k(η −vt) + d2 exp −k(η −vt).
   (A.14) Here, a1, a2, d1, d2 are constants, and k and v are arbitrary (0 ⩽v2 < v2n).
These solutions are valid only when n, a and b are along the principal axes of the primary static deformation. Case (ii).
if v2 = v2n −v2 b, then the solutions are either exponential in space and sinusoidal in time, f (ζ) = a1ekζ + a2e−kζ , g(η −vt) = d1 cos k(η −vt) + d2 sin k(η −vt),  (A.15) or sinusoidal in space and exponential in time, f (ζ) = a1 cos kζ + a2 sin kζ, g(η −vt) = d1ek(η−vt) + d2e−k(η−vt).
 (A.16) Here, a1, a2, d1, d2 are constants, k is arbitrary and v is given by ρv2 = C[(n · Bn) −(b · Bb)].
(A.17) These solutions are valid for any orientation of the plane of n and b. APPENDIX B Finite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane waves of complex exponential type in deformed Mooney–Rivlin materials Here, we prove that ﬁnite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane waves of complex exponential type may propagate in a homogeneously deformed Mooney–Rivlin material only when the planes of constant phase are at right angles with the planes of constant amplitude.
The material is ﬁrst subjected to a pure homogeneous static deformation, with corresponding deformation gradient F and left Cauchy–Green strain tensor B given by F = diag (λ1, λ2, λ3), B = diag (λ2 1, λ2 2, λ2 3), with J = det F = λ1λ2λ3.
(B.1)360 M. DESTRADE Then a linearly-polarized inhomogeneous plane wave of ﬁnite amplitude is superposed upon the large static deformation.
The motion is given by x = x + β{eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.}a = x + 2βe−ωS−·x cos ω(S+ · x −t)a.
(B.2) Here, β is a ﬁnite real scalar, S = S+ + iS−is a complex vector and ω is the real frequency.
The deformation gradient F associated with the motion (B.2) is given by F = ∂x/∂X = ˇFF, where ˇF = 1 + βωa ⊗{ieiω(S·x−t)S + c.c.}.
(B.3) The left Cauchy–Green tensor is B given by B = F FT = ˇFBˇFT.
The incompressibility constraint demands that det F = [1 + βω{i(a · S)eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.}](λ1λ2λ3) = 1, (B.4) at all times.
Therefore we must have a · S = 0, λ1λ2λ3 = 1.
(B.5) Also, ˇJ = det ˇF and J = det F are given by ˇJ = 1, and J = ˇJ J = J = λ1λ2λ3 = 1.
(B.6) In the absence of body forces, the equations of motion, written in the intermediate conﬁguration, read divx ( ˇJ TˇF−1T) = ρ ˇJ ∂2x ∂t2 , ∂( ˇJ TˇF−1T)i j ∂x j = ρ ˇJ ∂2xi ∂t2 , (B.7) where T is the Cauchy stress tensor associated with motion (B.2).
For a Mooney–Rivlin material, T is related to the deformation gradient through T = −p1 + CB −DB−1, (B.8) where p is the pressure.
Upon using (B.8), we have ˇJ TˇF−1T = −p ˇJ ˇF−1T + C ˇJ ˇFB −D ˇJ B−1 ˇF−1T. (B.9) Hence, with equation (B.6) and ∂( ˇJ ˇF−1T i j )/∂x j = 0, the Euler–Jacobi–Piola identity, the equations of motion (B.7) reduce to ˇF−1Tgradx p = Cdivx(ˇFB) −Ddivx(B−1 ˇF−1T) −ρ(∂2x/∂t2).
(B.10) Now we compute in turn the three terms of the right-hand side of this equation.
For the ﬁrst term, we have Cdivx(ˇFB) = Cβωdivx[a ⊗{ieiω(S·x−t)BS + c.c.}] = −Cβω2{(S · BS)eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.}a.
(B.11) Using (B.5), the second term is found as Ddivx(B−1 ˇF−1T) = Dβω2{[(S · S)B−1a + (a · B−1S)S]eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.} + Dβ2ω3(a · B−1a){i(S · S)e2iω(S·x−t)S + c.c.} + Dβ2ω3(a · B−1a)eiω(S−S)·x{i[(S −S) ·S]S + c.c.}.
(B.12)FINITE-AMPLITUDE INHOMOGENEOUS PLANE WAVES 361 Finally, the third term is given by −ρ(∂2x/∂t2) = ρβω2a{eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.}.
(B.13) In view of (B.11), (B.12), and (B.13), we must take p (to within a constant term) of the form p = βω{ip1eiω(S·x−t) + c.c.} + β2ω2{p2e2iω(S·x−t) + c.c.} + β2ω2 p3eiω(S−S)·x, (B.14) where p1, p2, p3 are scalars (p3 is real).
With this decomposition, we compute the right-hand side of (B.10) as −ˇF−1Tgradx p = βω2{p1eiω(S·x−t)S + c.c.} −β2ω3{ip2e2iω(S·x−t)S + c.c.} −β2ω3 p3i(S −S)eiω(S−S)·x.
(B.15) Now, using (B.11), (B.12), (B.13) and (B.15), we write the equations of motion (B.10), separating the respective coefﬁcients of eiω(S·x−t), e2iω(S·x−t), and eiω(S−S)·x, as −p1S + C(S · BS)a + D[(S · S)B−1a + (a · B−1S)S] = ρa, −p2S −D(a · B−1a)(S · S)S = 0, −p3(S −S) + D(a · B−1a){[(S −S) ·S)]S + [(S −S) · S)]S} = 0.
(B.16) Writing S as S = S+ + iS−, equation (B.16)3 is equivalent to [p3 −2D(a · B−1a)(S− · S−)]S−= [2D(a · B−1a)(S−· S+)]S+.
(B.17) Now, because the motion is inhomogeneous, S−is not parallel to S+ and therefore, we must have p3 − 2D(a · B−1a)(S−· S−) = 0 and also S−· S+ = 0, (B.18) which means that the planes of constant phase are orthogonal to the planes of constant amplitude.
