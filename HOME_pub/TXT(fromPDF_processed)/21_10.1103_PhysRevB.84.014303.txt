Perroni, V. Marigliano Ramaglia, and V. Cataudella CNR-SPIN and Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, Universit`a di Napoli “Federico II”, I-80126 Napoli, Italy (Received 22 April 2011; revised manuscript received 16 June 2011; published 21 July 2011) Electron coupling to intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational modes is investigated in models appropriate to single-crystal organic semiconductors, such as oligoacenes.
The focus is on spectral and transport properties of these systems beyond perturbative approaches.
The interplay between different couplings strongly affects the temperature-band renormalization that is the result of a subtle equilibrium between opposite tendencies: band narrowing due to interaction with local modes and band widening due to electron coupling to nonlocal modes.
The model provides an accurate description of the mobility as a function of temperature: Indeed, it has the correct order of magnitude at low temperatures, it scales as a power law T −δ with the exponent δ larger than unity, and, at high temperatures, it shows a hopping behavior with a small activation energy.

INTRODUCTION In the last years, the availability of single-crystal organic ﬁeld-effect transistors (OFETs) has represented a step forward in the ﬁeld of plastic electronics since these systems show a charge mobility at least one order of magnitude larger than that of thin ﬁlms.1 Among them, the most promising and studied are those based on oligoacenes, such as pentacene and rubrene.2 Although the transport properties in the linear regime have been carefully extracted by studying clean single-crystal OFET devices, the intrinsic transport mechanism acting in organic semiconductors (OSs) is, up to now, not fully understood.
Typically, in these materials, the induced doping is not very high (much smaller than one charge carrier for ten molecules), so that the mobility is analyzed in transport measurements.
At temperatures close to or higher than 100 K, the mobility μp of these systems exhibits a power-law behavior (μp ∼T −δ, with δ ≃2),2–4 which cannot be simply ascribed to band transport.5 Moreover, in some systems, starting from room temperature, there is a crossover from bandlike to activated hopping behavior.6 For example, in naphthalene and anthracene, along the a and b axis, there is a change in the temperature behavior of mobility, and, along the c axis, an activated regime takes place with a small activated gap of the order of 20 meV.7 Moreover, in pentacene, above room temperature, the mobility shows an upturn with increasing temperature.2 Recently, many photoemission experiments have been performed in pentacene and rubrene.8–11 The quasiparticle energy dispersion does not exhibit a strong mass renormal- ization, indicating moderate values of electron-phonon (el-ph) coupling.
For pentacene, the band structure is reduced only by ∼15% going from 75 to 300 K. Typically, the crossover from tunneling to hopping behavior observed in transport properties is ascribed to the formation of local polarons,12,13 and described with the simplest model for molecular crystals, the Holstein model.14,15 The modeling assumes that the most relevant carrier interaction is with local modes whose frequency is lower than the typical hopping energy.12,13 The approaches used only generalize the previous treatment of Holstein works,14,15 starting from the questionable limit of the narrow electronic band even for the coupling to low-frequency modes.
Actually, recent results, based on the adiabatic approach for the vibrational modes, have pointed out that, up to room temperature, within a parameter range valid for many oligoacenes, polaronic effects do not play a prominent role if low-frequency modes are excited in the Holstein model.16 Recent ab initio calculations have evidenced that charge carriers are mostly coupled to intramolecular modes with high frequency.
Moreover, it has been found that another very relevant interaction is with intermolecular modes with low frequency in comparison with typical electron hoppings.6,17 Another important result is that the reorganization energy (re- lated to the polaron binding energy) decreases with increasing the number of benzene rings in oligoacenes (for example, going from naphthalene to pentacene).
In view of ab initio results, Holstein-Peierls models have been considered for the description of OSs,18–20 modeling the carrier interaction with low-frequency intermolecular modes via a modulation of the transfer hopping.
Three-dimensional models have been mainly applied to naphtalene.18 One- dimensional models similar to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model21 have been introduced to study the OSs along the relevant stack direction.22–25 These models treat the inter- molecular modes as classical, exploiting their low energy in comparison with the electronic hopping scale.
The approaches are nonperturbative in the el-ph coupling.
The mobility is quite well described at low temperatures showing a robust power law T −δ.
However, the power-law behavior extends up to high T , and there is no sign of upturn in the mobility as a function of temperature.
The aim of this work is to clarify the effects of electron cou- pling to intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational modes on the transport properties of prototype single-crystal OSs, such as oligoacenes.
To accomplish this, a one-dimensional model with coupling to intramolecular and intermolecular modes has been analyzed.
We will show that the interplay between local and nonlocal el-ph interactions is able to provide a very accurate description of the mobility and to shed light on the intricate mechanism of band narrowing with increasing temperature.

MODEL We consider a one-dimensional model with coupling to intramolecular and intermolecular modes similar to one recently introduced, where the treatment only concerns the study of spectral properties.26 The coupling to intramolecular modes is Holstein-like; the coupling to intermolecular modes is SSH-like.
It can be summarized in the following Hamiltonian: H = H (0) el + H (0) Intra + H (0) Inter + Hel-Intra + Hel-Inter.
(1) In Eq. (1), the free electronic part H (0) el is H (0) el = −t  i (c† i ci+1 + c† i+1ci), (2) where t is the bare electron hopping between the nearest neighbors on the chain, c† i and ci are the charge-carrier creation and annihilation operators, respectively, relative to the site i of a chain with lattice parameter a.
For the transfer hopping the ab initio estimate is t ≃50–100 meV.6 We consider a single-band one-dimensional electronic structure since it represents the simplest effective model in the anisotropic OS to analyze the low-energy features responsible for the mobility properties.
In Eq. (1), H (0) α , with α = Intra, Inter is the Hamiltonian of the free-optical molecular modes H (0) α =  i r2 α,i 2mα +  i kαz2 α,i 2 , (3) where zα,i and rα,i are the oscillator displacement and momentum of the mode α, respectively, mα is the oscillator mass, and kα is the elastic constant of the mode α.
For nonlocal modes, we ﬁx yi = zInter,i; for local modes, xi = zIntra,i and pi = rIntra,i.
The intermolecular modes are characterized by small frequencies (¯hωInter ≃5–10 meV) in comparison with the transfer hopping.6,22 On the contrary, the most coupled intramolecular modes have large frequencies (¯hωIntra ≃130– 180 meV).6 In Eq. (1), Hel-Intra is the Holstein-like Hamiltonian describ- ing the electron coupling to intramolecular modes Hel-Intra = αIntra  i xini, (4) with αIntra the coupling constant to local modes and ni = c† i ci the local-density operator.
The dimensionless constant gIntra = αIntra/ √ 2¯hmIntraω3 Intra is used to describe this el-ph coupling.14 In single-crystal OSs, gIntra is in the weak-to-intermediate regime (of the order of unity).
Finally, in Eq. (1), Hel-Inter represents the SSH-like term with electron coupling to intermolecular modes Hel-Inter = αInter  i (yi+1 −yi)(c† i ci+1 + c† i+1ci), (5) with αInter the coupling constant to nonlocal modes.
In the adiabatic regime for nonlocal modes (¯hωInter ≪t), the dimensionless quantity λInter = α2 Inter/4kIntert fully provides the strength of the electron coupling to intermolecular modes.
The typical values of λ are in the intermediate coupling regime (of the order of or less than 0.1).
In the following, we will use units such that the lattice parameter a = 1, the Planck constant ¯h = 1, the Boltzmann constant kB = 1, and the electron charge e = 1.
We will analyze systems with a chain size L = 32 (where the system reaches the thermodynamic limit), and we will measure energies in units of t ≃80 meV.
We ﬁx ωIntra = 2.0 as the highest energy scale.6 For the calculation of dynamic quantities, an additional small broadening  is introduced in order to simulate the effect of a tiny disorder.
We ﬁx  = 0.05t, therefore it is the smallest energy scale.
The results at low temperatures are only slightly dependent on the value of . III.
METHOD Since a very low carrier density is injected into OSs, we will study the case of a single particle.
The temperature range in which intrinsic effects are relevant is ωInter ⩽T ≪t < ωIntra.
Therefore, the dynamics of intermolecular modes is assumed classical.
Actually, the electron dynamics are strongly inﬂuenced by the statistical “off diagonal” disorder that, in the limit of low carrier density, is described by the probability function P({yi}) of free classical harmonic oscillators: P({yi}) = βkInter 2π L/2 exp  −β kInter 2  i y2 i  , (6) with β = 1/T .
At a ﬁxed conﬁguration of nonlocal displacements {yi}, Eq. (1) is equivalent to a Holstein model, where the electron hopping between nearest-neighbor sites is not homogeneous and depends on the speciﬁc pair [see Eq. (5)].
The resulting inhomogeneous Holstein model can be accurately studied within the modiﬁed Lang-Firsov approach via a unitary trans- formation U, provided that the system is in the antiadiabatic regime (ωIntra > t), where the quantum nature of phonons cannot be neglected.27,28 The electron is renormalized by the coupling with local modes increasing its mass, and the oscillators are displaced from their equilibrium position to a distance proportional to the el-ph interaction.
In our case, the new Hamiltonian ˜H = U −1HU is built through the variational transformation: U({yj}) = exp  igIntra  2 mIntraωIntra  i fi({yj})pini  , (7) where the variational parameters fi({yj}), giving the new cen- ters for the local oscillators at the sites i, have to be determined for each ﬁxed conﬁguration of nonlocal displacements {yj}.
Within our approach,28,29 the solution of the full problem can be obtained by minimizing the free energy of the following inhomogeneous effective Hamiltonian: ˜Heff({yi}) = H (0) Intra +  i  f 2 i ({yj}) −2fi({yj}) ni +  i [−t + αInter(yi+1 −yi)] e−Ti,i+1({yj}) × (c† i ci+1 + H.c.), (8) where Ti,j({yj}) = g2 Intra  f 2 i ({yj}) + f 2 j ({yj}) (2N0 + 1) 2 (9) 014303-2EFFECTS OF ELECTRON COUPLING TO . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 84, 014303 (2011) represents the term giving the reduction of the bond hopping, with N0 = 1/(eβωIntra −1) the Bose distribution of the local modes.
The distribution of fi values depends on the distribu- tion P({yi}).
For example, close to T = 0.5t, the deviations of fi from the average value can become of the order of 20% in the parameter regime investigated in this work.
For strong el-ph coupling and high temperatures, the values of fi are close to one (Ti,i+1 large), meaning that the system is characterized by small polaron behavior and incoherent hopping dynamics.
For intermediate el-ph coupling and low temperatures, the distribution of fi can have an average smaller than unity.
This implies that there is a possibility of tunneling dynamics with a renormalized bandwidth (Ti,i+1 not large).
At ﬁxed conﬁguration {yj}, one has to diagonalize ˜Heff, yielding L eigenvalues En and eigenvector components bj(n), with j = 1, . . . ,L.
In this paper, we will focus on the density of states D(ω)({yj}) D(ω)({yj}) = 1 L  i Ai,i(ω)({yj}), (10) where Ai,i(ω)({yj}) represents the diagonal term of the spectral function Ai,i(ω)({yj}) =  n |bi(n)|2e−Ti,i({yj}) × ∞  −∞ eβlω0Il[Vi({yj})]Bn(ω −lω0), (11) with Vi({yj}) = 2g2 Intraf 2 i ({yj})√N0(N0 + 1), Il(z) the modi- ﬁed Bessel function of order l, and the function Bn(z) Bn(z) = 1 π  (z −En)2 + 2 .
(12) The sum over l provides the contribution of phonon replicas to the density of states.29 Another central quantity of this work is the mobility as a function of the temperature.
At ﬁxed conﬁguration {yj}, the mobility μ({yj}) of the inhomogeneous Holstein model is determined starting from the real part of the conductivity Re[σ(ω)]({yj}), taking the limit of zero frequency and dividing for the single-particle density 1/L of the system.
In the linear regime, the real part of the conductivity is derived from the Kubo formula29 Re[σ(ω)]({yj}) = (1 −e−βω) 2ω 1 L   ∞ −∞ dt eiωt⟨j †(t)j(0)⟩, (13) where j = −i  j,δ δc† j+δcjhj,δ({yj}) (14) is the current operator, hj,δ({yj}) = t −αδ(yj+δ −yj) denotes the generalized hopping, and δ = −1,1 indicates the nearest neighbors.
In our approach, the current-current correlation function becomes ⟨j †(t)j(0)⟩=  j,j1  δ,δ1 (δδ1)hj,δhj1,δ1Cj,δ;j1,δ1(t)Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t), (15) where Cj,δ;j1,δ1(t) is the electron correlation function Cj,δ;j1,δ1(t) = ⟨c† j(t)cj+δ(t)c† j1+δ1(0)cj1(0)⟩˜Heff, (16) and Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t) is the phonon correlation function Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t) = ⟨X† j(t)Xj+δ(t)X† j1+δ1(0)Xj1(0)⟩˜Heff, (17) with Xi the multiphonon operator Xi = exp  igIntra  2 mIntraωIntra fi({yj})pi  .
(18) The function Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t) can be written as Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t) = e−Tj,j+δ({yj })e−Tj1,j1+δ1({yj }) +  Ej,δ;j1,δ1(t) −e−Tj,j+δ({yj })e−Tj1,j1+δ1({yj })	 .
(19) With the ﬁrst term of the previous equation, one can build up the coherent part of conductivity, where the charge transfer is not accompanied by processes changing the number of phonons.
With the second term, retaining only the main autocorrelation contribution j = j1, one gets the incoherent part of the conductivity, which takes into account inelastic- scattering processes of emission and absorption of phonons.30 If an observable O depends on the displacements {yi}, ﬁrst one makes the average over the eigenstates and eigenvectors of ˜Heff({yi}), then over the distribution P({yi}), making the integral ⟨O⟩=    i dyi  P({yi}) ˜O({yi}) (20) by means of a Monte Carlo procedure.
Actually, we generate a sequence of random numbers distributed according to P({yi}).
For the systems investigated in this paper, a few thousand iterations are sufﬁcient to get a good accuracy even for dynamic quantities.
The method exposed above is very accurate in the regime ωInter ≪t and ωIntra > t appropriate to OSs.
It properly takes into account the quantum effects of high-frequency local vibrational modes.
Moreover, the approach is able to include spatial correlations relevant in quasi-one-dimensional systems, in particular, vertex corrections in the calculation of mobility. IV.
RESULTS First, we analyze the case λInter = 0.
In Fig. 1, we report the mobility by varying the values of gIntra.
For weak gIntra, a coherent behavior is present with a power law of the order of 1/T at low temperature.
As expected, with increasing gIntra, there is a crossover from tunneling to hopping behavior due to the formation of localized small polarons.
This occurs at temperatures slightly larger than 0.5t for gIntra = 1.3.
For large values of gIntra, the low-temperature power-law part is strongly reduced, and the activated behavior is followed by the residual scattering regime at very high T .29 In the variational approach, the crossover from bandlike to hopping regime is marked by the value f = 1 on all the sites.
However, in the intermediate regime (for example, gIntra = 1.3), at temperatures characterized by a metallic behavior, the calculation provides values of f smaller than unity (f of the 014303-3PERRONI, MARIGLIANO RAMAGLIA, AND CATAUDELLA PHYSICAL REVIEW B 84, 014303 (2011) FIG.

Inset: The density of states D as a function of the frequency at T = 0 for different values of local coupling gIntra. order of 0.6), suggesting that the tunneling regime is reduced but still present.
Moreover, at higher temperatures, where f = 1 is recovered, the activated gap   in the hopping mobility is not very large:   ≃0.54t.
In the inset of Fig. 1, we report the density of states at T = 0 for the same values of gIntra as the main ﬁgure.
As expected, with increasing gIntra, there is a reduction of the fundamental polaronic band with a transfer of spectral weight to high satellite bands appearing at multiples of the vibrational frequency ωIntra.29 The description of mobility based only on the intramolecular-mode electron coupling fails for two reasons in the comparison with low-temperature experiments.
First, it does not provide large values of the mobility (expressed in our natural units, that is in terms of μ0 = ea2/¯h ≃7 cm2/(V s), taking a = 7 ˚A (Ref. 6)].
For example, at T = 0.31t (room temperature), μ is less than 0.5μ0 for gIntra = 1.3; then the low-temperature mobility due to local coupling scales as 1/T .
The next step is to combine the effects of high-frequency local vibrational modes with nonlocal low-frequency ones.
These nonlocal modes are considered relevant for the descrip- tion of the mobility up to room temperature.
Actually, for rubrene, the carrier mobility is dominated by intermolecular phonons (the nonlocal coupling is estimated to be in the intermediate regime λInter ≃0.09) since the interaction with the intramolecular modes is almost negligible (gIntra ≃0.7).31 In pentacene, the coupling with local modes is of the same order as that in rubrene.6 For these materials, our approach (the local el-ph coupling perturbative) predicts a slight reduction of mobility in agreement with results present in the literature.31 On the other hand, going from pentacene to naphthalene, the reorganization energy nearly increases twice, suggesting a much stronger coupling with local modes.6 Therefore, for systems with a reduced number of benzene rings like naphtha- lene, we expect a larger interplay between intramolecular and intermolecular modes within the intermediate el-ph coupling regime for both modes. FIG.
2. (Color online) The density of states as a function of the frequency for different temperatures at λInter = 0.09 and gIntra = 1.3.
In Fig. 2, we report the density of states D for gIntra = 1.3 and λInter = 0.09 at different temperatures.
At T = 0, where the effect of nonlocal modes is weak, the lowest band is strongly renormalized at lower energies and becomes narrower (approximately half of the bare band).
The intrinsic reduction of the bare band provides a simple and direct explanation of the difference in the bandwidth evidenced in the series of oligoacenes from naphthalene (effective band of the order of 40 meV) to pentacene (effective band of the order of 80 meV).
Indeed, it can be ascribed to the decrease of the reorganization energy that in turn reduces the renormalization effects.6 At ﬁnite temperature, the shape of the spectra is changed due to the nonlocal coupling.
Actually, any band shows a different small maximum due to the coupling to intermolecular modes.
Moreover, the band narrowing is strongly reduced in the presence of nonlocal coupling.
In order to clarify this point, we notice that, for λInter = 0, the principal band at T = 0.35 is reduced by ∼42% of the band at T = 0.
On the other hand, for λInter = 0.09, the principal band at T = 0.35 is reduced by only 7% of the band at T = 0.
The narrowing of the principal band results from a subtle equilibrium between the two opposite tendencies.
Actually, the coupling to nonlocal modes has the main effect of inducing scattering into the single bands of the density of states, preventing the narrowing induced by the coupling to local modes.
The interplay between local and nonlocal modes is able to produce a modest narrowing as a function of the temperature even if the coupling to local modes is not weak.
Our prediction is that this effect should be present not only in pentacene,10 but also in naphthalene and anthracene.
Finally, we analyze the mobility in the intermediate regime (see Fig. 3).
As shown in the previous section, the mobility can be divided into two contributions:30 the coherent, where the scattering of the renormalized electron (the only effect due to local el-ph coupling is here the reduction of the bandwidth) with nonlocal modes is included, and the incoherent one, where, in addition to nonlocal modes, scattering with multiple real local phonons is considered.
The ﬁrst term, relevant at low temperatures, bears a strong resemblance to the mobility of the system at gIntra = 0, even if, as expected, it is smaller.

3. (Color online) Mobility and its different contributions as a function of the temperature.
Inset: The mobility as a function of temperature for different values of gIntra.
For comparison, the behavior with δ = 2 is shown.
The incoherent term starts at a temperature of T ∼0.25 and becomes predominant at higher temperatures.
Actually, the coherent term decreases with temperature even if the electron dynamics become incoherent.
The role of the local coupling is to promote an activated behavior in the incoherent regime.
The cooperative effect is able to provide an activation energy   of about 0.25t, less than one half of that for λInter = 0 and close to that extracted by the data in naphthalene.7 Moreover, the upturn in the mobility starts at lower temperatures in comparison with the case λInter = 0.
The local coupling is able to affect but not destroy the low- temperature behavior dominated by the nonlocal coupling.
In the inset of Fig. 3, we report the low-temperature mobility in logarithmic scale.
Actually, for gIntra = 0, the mobility scales as 1/T 1.89, while, with increasing gIntra, the power law becomes slightly less pronounced.
In the case of gIntra = 1.3, the mobility scales as 1/T 1.60, which is still compatible with experiments in naphthalene.7 In summary, the proposed model is able to capture many features of the mobility in oligoacenes.
First, it has the correct order of magnitude: For T = 200 K (T ≃0.2t), μ ≃1.5μ0 ≃10 cm2/(V s), while at T = 100 K (T ≃0.1t), μ ≃4μ0 ≃28 cm2/(V s).
These values compare favorably with mobility measurements in naphthalene: for T = 200 K, μ ≃4 cm2/(V s) in the hole channel and μ ≃1 cm2/(V s) in theelectronchannel, whileat T = 100K, μ ≃20 cm2/(V s) in the hole channel and μ ≃3 cm2/(V s) in the electron channel.7 At low temperatures, the mobility scales as a power law T −δ with the exponent δ ≃1.6 times larger than unity even if an intermediate el-ph coupling to local modes is present.
Starting from room temperature, the incoherent contribution of mobility begins increasing.
At high temperatures, the mobility shows a hopping behavior with a small activation energy.
The theory is intended to describe the mobility in the direction in which it has the maximum value.
Typically, this corresponds to a direction into the growth plane of the OFET on the substrate.2 The study of mobility in the other in-plane direction and out of plane is out of the scope of this study.
V. CONCLUSIONS The interplay between local and nonlocal el-ph couplings strongly affects the band narrowing and the mobility as a function of the temperature.
The band narrowing has a polaronic origin but it is strongly dependent on the nonlocal el-ph coupling.
In the intermediate coupling regime of the electron with both intramolecular and intermolecular modes, the mobility scales as a power law T −δ at low temperatures, and it is characterized by hopping behavior with a small activation energy at high temperatures.
We believe that the main conclusions will not be qualitatively modiﬁed by the inclusion of more realistic lattice structures and interactions since the results rely on general features of different types of el-ph coupling.
The next step will be to investigate the effect of traps on the low-temperature mobility generalizing the model presented in this paper.
