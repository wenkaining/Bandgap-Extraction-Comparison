For a current transverse to the domain wall, the dynamics of the thermally activated creep regime and the depinning transition are found to be compatible with a self-consistent universal description of magnetic-ﬁeld- induced domain-wall dynamics.
This common universal behavior, characteristic of the so-called quenched Edwards-Wilkinson universality class, is conﬁrmed by an independent analysis of domain-wall roughness.
Complementary investigations reveal the directional properties of interaction between current and domain walls which result in the instability of their transverse orientation.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184420 I. INTRODUCTION The displacement of small spin textures such as magnetic domain walls (DWs) thanks to spin torque effects is at the basis of potential applications of magnetic data storage [1].
An important effort is ongoing to ﬁnd magnetic materials [2,3] with large and well-controlled DW velocities.
However, DWs are very sensitive to weak pinning defects [4,5], which strongly reduce their mobility and produce roughening and stochastic avalanchelike motion [6,7].
Therefore, it is par- ticularly interesting to better understand the contribution of pinning to current-induced DW dynamics.
Magnetic domain walls [4–12] present surprising universal critical behaviors, shared with a wide variety of moving interfaces such as the reaction front propagation in disordered ﬂows [13], growing bacterial colonies [14], wetting [15], and motion of ferroelectric domain walls [16], to name a few.
The interfaces are rough with self-afﬁne width growing as Lζ, where L the distance between two points of the interface and ζ the roughness exponent.
Moreover, a depinning threshold force fd separates the so-called creep ( f < fd) and depinning ( f ≳fd) regimes.
In the creep regime, the velocity varies as an Arrhenius law v ∼e−E/kBT [4,11,17], where kBT is the thermal ﬂuctuation energy.
E is the effective pinning energy barrier height, which follows a universal power-law variation with the driving force E ∼f −μ, where μ is the creep exponent.
In the depinning regime [12,18,19], the ef- fective pinning barriers are collapsed.
The velocity presents power-law variations with drive f and temperature T : v ∼ ( f −fd)β and v( fd) ∼T ψ, where β and ψ are the depinning and thermal rounding exponents, respectively.
*vincent.jeudy@u-psud.fr Universal behaviors have been extensively investigated for DWs driven by magnetic ﬁeld ( f ∝H) in ferromagnetic ultra- thin ﬁlms.
For a large variety of materials, the measured values of the creep (μ = 1/4) [4,9–11] and roughness (ζ ≈0.66 [4,5,9] and ζ ≈1.25 [7]) exponents are compatible with the prediction for the motion of an elastic one-dimensional (1D) line in a short-range weak pinning disorder, described by the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (qEW) universality class, with [20] and without [17,21] anharmonic contributions.
Moreover, it was recently shown [12] that the depinning transition is compatible with the predictions for the qEW universality class (β = 0.25 [18] and ψ = 0.15 [19]).
In contrast, the universal behaviors of DW motion induced by spin-polarized electric current are more contentious.
To the best of our knowledge, the universal behavior of the depinning transition has not yet been explored.
For the creep motion, a compatibility with μ = 1/4 is suggested for DW driven by the conventional spin-transfer torque (STT) in Pt/Co/Pt nanowires [22] and by spin-orbit torque (SOT) in ferrimagnets [2].
However, rather intriguing differences between current- and magnetic-ﬁeld-driven motion are also reported in the literature.
Different values of the creep exponent were re- ported for other materials (μ = 0.33 ± 0.06 for (Ga,Mn)As [8] and μ = 0.39 ± 0.06 for Ta/CoFeB/MgO [10]), which are difﬁcult to interpret.
The tilting and faceting [5,23] of DWs, produced by the current, could suggest a compatibility with the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) universality class [5].
However, in the direction perpendicular to DW, the roughness is characterized by an exponent (ζj = 0.69 ± 0.04) independent of DW tilting angle and compatible with the measurement obtained for ﬁeld-driven DW motion (ζH = 0.68 ± 0.04), while a different value (ζj = 0.99 ± 0.01) is obtained in the direction of current.
Therefore, whether dis- tinct or common universality classes describe the motion of 2469-9950/2019/100(18)/184420(9) 184420-1 ©2019 American Physical SocietyR. DÍAZ PARDO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) DWs produced by current and magnetic ﬁeld remains an open question.
Moreover, the origin of STT-induced DW tilting and its contribution to DW dynamics and universal behaviors are not well understood.
In this paper, we propose an extensive and comparative study on DW motion driven by STT and magnetic ﬁeld.
Investigations were conducted with the ferromagnetic semi- conductor (Ga,Mn)As, which presents a sufﬁciently low de- pinning threshold [24] to cover the creep, depinning, and ﬂow dynamical regimes [25], and to discuss, in particular, DW tilting without pinning.
Our stringent test of universality relies on the veriﬁcation that magnetic-ﬁeld-driven DW motion in our sample shares the common universal (material and tem- perature independent) behaviors encountered in a variety of other magnetic materials [4,5,9–11] and on the independent analysis of DW dynamics and roughness, which are both consistent with the conclusion of common universal behaviors for STT and ﬁeld-driven DW motion.
The paper is organized as follows.
After a description of the experimental techniques (Sec. II), we compare the shape evolution of DWs driven by STT and magnetic ﬁeld and analyze their roughness (Sec. III).
Section IV details a comparative study of DW dynamics.
In Sec. V, we discuss the origin of DW faceting produced by STT and its implications for DW dynamics. II.
EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES The experiments were performed with rectangles of a 4-nm-thick (Ga,Mn)(As,P)/(Ga,Mn)As bilayer ﬁlm patterned by lithography.
The ﬁlm was grown on a (001) GaAs/AlAs buffer [26].
It has an effective perpendicular anisotropy and a Curie temperature (Tc) of 65 K. The sizes of rectangles were 133 × 210, 228 × 302, and 323 × 399 μm2 (see Appendix A for the details).
Two 40-μm-wide gold electrodes (separated by 110, 204, and 300 μm, respectively) were deposited by evaporation parallel to the narrow sides of rectangles.
They were used to generate a homogeneous current density driving DW motion by STT.
The pulse amplitude varied between 0 and 11 GA/m2.
We veriﬁed that the Joule effect had a negligible contribution on DW dynamics (see Appendix B).
Perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld pulses of adjustable amplitude (0–65 mT) were produced by a 75-turn small coil (diameter ∼1 mm) mounted on the sample.
The DW displacement is observed using a magneto-optical Kerr microscope (resolution ∼1 μm).
The DW velocity is deﬁned as the ratio between the average displacement ⟨u⟩and the pulse duration t, which varies between 1 μs and 120 s.
The setup was placed against the cold ﬁnger of an optical He-ﬂow cryostat, which allowed the temperature to be stabilized to between 5.7 K and Tc. III.
DOMAIN-WALL DISPLACEMENT AND ROUGHNESS IN THE CREEP REGIME The time evolution of an initially almost ﬂat DW driven by magnetic ﬁeld and STT is compared in Fig. 1.
For ﬁeld- driven DW motion, the average successive displacements are relatively similar.
The initial DW shape is almost conserved during the motion.
The DWs become sometimes strongly pinned and curved [see Fig. 1(a)] but are ﬂattened again when FIG.

depinned due to the combined effects of DW elasticity and driving force, which acts as a pressure ( f ∝H).
In contrast, the initial DW shape is signiﬁcantly altered by the current [see Fig. 1(b)]. DWs are tilted and form faceted structures.
The faceting process seems to start close to “strong” pinning centers [5] and to produce a reduction of DW displacements with increasing tilting angle θ until DWs stop (on the ex- periment timescale), as already observed in Pt/Co/Pt ﬁlms [5].
In Sec. V, we will show that the faceting results from an instability of the transverse alignment between current and the DW, which can be triggered even without any contribution from pinning.
Let us start with investigations of universal behaviors with a study on DW self-afﬁnity using the displacement- displacement correlation function [4]: w(L) =  x [u(x + L) −u(x)]2, (1) where u(x) is the DW displacement measured parallel to the current and L the length of DW segment along the x axis trans- verse to the current [see Fig. 2(a)].
For a self-afﬁne interface, the function w(L) is expected to follow a power-law variation w(L) ∼L2ζ, where ζ is the roughness exponent.
Typical variations of w vs L obtained for ﬁeld- and current-induced motion are compared in Fig. 2(b) in log-log scale.
As it can be observed, both curves present a linear variation with similar slopes (= 2ζ), between the microscope resolution (≈1 μm) and L = 10 μm.
In order to get more statistics, the slopes were systematically determined for successions of DW positions and a temperature varying over one decade (T = 4.5–59 K, see Appendix C for the statistical study).
The mean and stan- dard deviation of the roughness exponent for current (ζj)- and ﬁeld (ζH)-driven DW motion is reported in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature.
As expected for universal critical exponents, the values of ζj and ζH do not vary signiﬁcantly.
Their mean values (ζj = 0.60 ± 0.05 and ζH = 0.61 ± 0.04), calculated from all measurements, agree well within experimental error, which is a signature of common universal behavior.
Here, it is important to discuss differences and sim- ilarities with the results reported for Pt/Co/Pt in Ref. [5].
For (Ga,Mn)(As,P), ζj presents no signiﬁcant variation 184420- 2COMMON UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR OF MAGNETIC DOMAIN … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) FIG. 2.

A value ζj ≈1 most probably reﬂects the large linear tilting trend of DWs [27] [inserting a linear variation of u(x) in Eq. (1) leads to ζ = 1] and not a universal behavior of their roughness.
In contrast, the value ζj = 0.60 ± 0.05 is compatible with the results (ζj = 0.68 ± 0.04) of Ref.
[5] for a DW roughness analyzed in the direction (⃗n) normal to DW.
Therefore, the compatibility of results obtained for (Ga,Mn)(As,P) and Pt/Co/Pt ﬁlms [5] strongly suggests that the common universal behaviors for current- and ﬁeld-driven DW motion should be observed in a variety of other materials.
Interestingly, as the equilibrium roughness ζ (≈2/3) and the creep exponents are linked by the scaling relation [4,17] μ = (2ζ −1)/(2 −ζ ), it is natural to infer that the creep motion of DW driven by STT should be characterized by the same universal exponent (μ = 1/4) as the magnetic-ﬁeld- driven DW motion, in agreement with the results obtained for Pt/Co/Pt nanowires [22].
Moreover, the depinning transition should also be described by the values of universal exponents β (= 0.25) and ψ (= 0.15) expected for the qEW universality class. IV.
DOMAIN-WALL DYNAMICS In order to discuss those assertions, we have investigated the DW dynamics.
The velocity measurements were all per- formed with almost ﬂat DWs transverse to the current (θ ≈0) (see Fig. 1) in order to circumvent the variation of driving FIG. 3.

The lower and upper stars correspond to the velocities at the de- pinning threshold v( jd ) and vT ( jd ), respectively.
A sliding average over ﬁve points is used to smooth the curves.
The unexpected large velocities measured for T = 54 K and j > 7.5 GA/m2 were not used for the ﬁt.
Inset: Semilog plot of the same velocity curves vs j−1/4 highlighting the thermally activated creep regime and its ﬁt. force with DW tilt.
The velocity curves are reported in Fig. 3 as well as their analysis using a self-consistent description of the universal behaviors developed for ﬁeld-driven DW motion [12,24,28–30]: v( j) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ v( jd) exp  −E kBT  creep : j < jd vT ( jd ) x0  j−jd jd β depinning : j ≳jd vT ( jd) j jd linear f low : j ≫jd, (2) where jd is the depinning threshold and v( jd) the veloc- ity at the depinning threshold.
For the thermally activated creep regime, the energy barrier height is given by E = kBTd [( j/jd)−μ −1], where kBTd is the characteristic height of the effective pinning barrier.
For the linear ﬂow regime, vT ( jd) = v( jd)(Td/T )ψ is the velocity that DW would reach at j = jd without pinning.
The description of the depinning regime in Eqs.
(2) is only valid over a limited range: it does not account for the effect of thermal ﬂuctuations occurring at and just above the depinning threshold nor for the crossover to the linear ﬂow regime [12].
Note that the critical exponents μ (= 1/4), β (= 0.25), and ψ (= 0.15), and the parame- ter x0 (= 0.65) in Eqs.
(2) characterize the universal (i.e., temperature and material independent) behaviors of ﬁeld- driven DW motion, which are described by the qEW minimal model [12,17–19].
Therefore, the comparison between the velocity curves (Fig. 3) and Eqs.
(2) relies only on three adjustable temperature- and material-dependent parameters [ jd(T ), v( jd(T )), and Td(T )], whose values are related to the micromagnetic and microscopic pinning parameters [24].
To evidence the depinning threshold, we performed ﬁts of the creep law for increasing values of jd(T ) and v( jd, T ) on the velocity curves [Td(T ) is the free parameter].

In order to verify that those limits are effectively signatures of the depinning threshold, we performed simulta- neous ﬁts of the predictions of Eq. (1) for the depinning and ﬂow regime using a ﬁne tuning of point [ jd(T ), v( jd, T )] on the creep law.
The coordinates of optimum points (indicated by stars with half ﬁlled down in Fig. 3) and the values of Td(T ), obtained at different temperatures, are reported in Table I.
The good agreement between the velocity curves and the predictions of Eqs.
(2) evidences the depinning threshold and demonstrates that the observed DW dynamics covers the creep, depinning, and ﬂow regimes.
Note that the investigation of DW motion above the depinning threshold was not accessible in experi- ments with CoFeB [10] and even less with Pt/Co/Pt [5,22] due to the too low efﬁciency of STT.
The compatibility of DW dynamics with Eqs.
(2) is a strong evidence that DW motion induced by transverse current through the STT mechanism shares the common universal behavior of DW driven by a magnetic ﬁeld observed in thin magnetic ﬁlms made of different materials [4,9–12,24].
Our analysis of DW dynamics and roughness is compatible with the conclusions reported for the creep motion in Pt/Co/Pt ﬁlms [5,22].
In contrast, while a similar material is investi- gated, the results obtained for (Ga,Mn)As nanowires [8] are not conﬁrmed (see also the Supplemental Material of Ref.
[11] for ﬁeld-driven DW motion over a large velocity range).
The different values of creep exponent reported in Refs.
[8] and [10] could originate from a pinning of DWs by the edges of nanowires [28] or from the tilting of DW, which is not controlled.
Beyond the analysis of universal behavior, it is also partic- ularly interesting to compare the material-dependent pinning properties of DWs driven by STT and magnetic ﬁeld.
To achieve this objective, we have performed the analysis of magnetic-ﬁeld-driven DW dynamics close to the depinning transition (see Fig. 4).
For the ﬁt of velocity curves we used the procedure described above [ jd(T ) was replaced by Hd(T )].
The pinning parameters are reported in Table I. Fol- lowing Ref.
[22], we can deﬁne the ﬁeldlike effect of the STT by Hd = ϵJd.
The obtained value (ϵ ≈4 × 10−12 T m2/A) is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than for Pt/Co/Pt ﬁlms (= 1.6 × 10−14 T m2/A) [22], reﬂecting the much larger efﬁciency of STT in (Ga,Mn)(As,P).
In addition, the simi- lar values of Td obtained for ﬁeld- and current-driven DW FIG. 4.

The solid, dashed, and dotted lines are predictions for the creep [H < Hd(T )], depinning [H ≳Hd(T )], and ﬂow [H ≫ Hd(T )] regime, respectively.
The lower and upper stars correspond to the velocities v(Hd ) and vT (Hd ) at the depinning threshold Hd, respectively.
The slightly nonlinear variations observed for T = 59 K and H > 33 mT were not used for the ﬁt of ﬂow regime.
dynamics [Td(H)/Td( j) = 1.0 ± 0.3] indicate that a similar random disorder controls DW pinning.
Finally, the ratio Td/T (≈5–10) is rather small compared to other materials [12,24], which explains why the depinning threshold is not straightfor- ward to observe in the velocity curves (Figs. 3 and 4) without a comparison with the ﬁt of Eqs. (2).
V. ORIGIN OF DOMAIN-WALL FACETING Let us now discuss the tilting and faceting of DWs, which is observed only for current-driven motion (see Fig. 1 and Ref. [5]).
First, we analyze the evolution of an initially almost rectangular domain subjected to a current density ( j = 11 GA/m2), sufﬁciently large to move untilted DWs (θ = 0, i.e., ⃗j ∥⃗n, where ⃗n is the direction normal to DW) in the ﬂow regime.
As it can be observed in Fig. 5, the edges of the domain aligned along the current (i.e., ⃗j ⊥⃗n) remain almost motionless.
In contrast, the back and front DWs perpendicular to the current (i.e., ⃗j ∥⃗n) are signiﬁcantly displaced.
Surprisingly, the back DW moves faster than the front DW, which causes the collapse of the domain [see Figs. 5(e)–5(f)].
Another interesting feature is the increasingly pointed shape of the front DW (not observed for the back DW).
Here, the faceting of the front DW develops without any contribution of “strong” pinning sites, which suggests that the transverse orientation between DW and current is unstable.
Consequently, the different shape evolutions of the front and back DWs observed in Figs. 5(a)–5(f) can be interpreted as a result of opposite contributions of DW elasticity.
The two side DWs pull the extremities of the back (front) DW in the −⃗j (⃗j) direction, which tends to stabilize (destabilize) the transverse DW orientation.
To explore more quantitatively the directionality of inter- action between DW and current, we have measured the DW 184420-4COMMON UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR OF MAGNETIC DOMAIN … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) FIG.
5. Current-driven domain-wall motion.
(a–f) Evolution of an almost rectangular magnetic domain submitted to pulses of cur- rent (duration t = 6 μs and amplitude j = 11 GA/m2) for T = 45 K. The gray levels correspond to opposite directions of magne- tization ⃗M perpendicular to the sample.
The back DW conserves its shape and velocity while the front DW becomes pointed, which reduces its velocity and leads to the collapse of the domain (see images e and f).
(g, h) Two successive images of domains (t = 1 μs and j = 11.1 GA/m2) showing, for T = 55 K, the displacement xn of a tilted DW (see the dashed and solid segments) along its normal direction ⃗n.

The error bars reﬂect the uncertainties of tilting angle and displacement.
displacements xn along direction ⃗n as a function of the angle θ between ⃗n and −⃗j for a ﬁxed magnitude of current density and pulse duration t = 1 μs [see Figs. 5(g) and 5(h)].
We have then deduced the variation of velocity vn = xn/t as a function of | j| cos θ, which is reported Fig. 5(i).
As expected, the DW velocity decreases as the tilting angle increases (i.e.,| j| cos θ decreases).
For | j| cos θ < 2.25 GA/m2, the dis- placement xn becomes lower than the spatial resolution so that the estimation for vn is zero.
The dispersion of data most probably results from the contributions of DW elasticity, which tends to reduce DW velocity.
Therefore, the velocity DW without contribution of elasticity should correspond to the upper measured values.
Interestingly, those values present a rather good overlap with the velocity curves of Fig. 3, which were obtained as a function of the current density and for θ = 0.
This indicates that DW tilting reduces the driving force in the direction normal ⃗n to the DW and suggests that the DW faceting originates from the directionality of the driving force f ∝⃗j · ⃗n.
Let us now discuss the consequence of the variation of the driving force with DW tilting (∝j cos θ) on univer- sal behaviors.
The second-order expansion of cos θ [≈1 − (1/2)(∂u/∂x)2] introduces a so-called KPZ term [λ(∂u/∂x)2 with λ = −j/2] in the equation of motion [31], which is usually used to describe interface tilting.
However, at large tilting angle, the relation f ∝⃗j · ⃗n should not be compatible with the KPZ minimal model.
In contrast, in the direction ⃗n perpendicular to DW, for a ﬁxed DW tilting, the driving force due to spin-transfer torque is simply proportional to j cos θ and acts as a magnetic ﬁeld ( f ∝H).
This could explain the compatibility of current-induced DW motion with the qEW universality class, which is observed experimentally. VI.
CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have shown that the roughness and dynamics of DWs driven by spin-transfer torque and magnetic ﬁeld present common universal behaviors compatible with a short-range weak pinning disorder described by the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson universality class.
The agreement with the self-consistent description of creep and depinning regimes should help to better understand spin-transfer-torque– induced DW motion experiments [2], since it allows clear identiﬁcation of dynamical regimes and discrimination be- tween universal and material-dependent behaviors [24].
In this frame, it would be also very interesting to study the universal behaviors of DWs driven by spin-orbit torque [32] and of DWs in antiferromagnets [33].
Moreover, we evidence the instability of transverse align- ment between DW and current in the creep and ﬂow regimes.
The latter originates from the decrease of driving force and consequently of DW velocity with DW tilting.
Our results also strongly suggest that for sufﬁciently large tilting angle, the motion of DWs is not compatible with the quenched Kardar- Parisi-Zhang minimal model [31].
The contribution of DW tilting to their dynamics should also have direct implications for potential applications based on the controlled-motion DWs [1] in nanowires.
Indeed, the spin-transfer torque tends to stabilize DW alignment in the direction of current.

APPENDIX A: SAMPLE DETAILS The devices used for our study are shown in Fig. 6(a).
They consist of a 4-nm-thick (Ga,Mn)As/(Ga,Mn)(As,P) bilayer grown on a (001) GaAs/AlAs buffer and covered by a GaAs cap.
The bilayer and the GaAs cap were grown at ∼220 ◦C, and the rest of the structure at ∼500 ◦C [26].
A postgrowth annealing was performed so as to remove interstitial Mn ions.
The stack was then patterned by lithography in a set of rectangles with three different sizes: 133 × 210, 228 × 184420-5R. DÍAZ PARDO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) FIG. 6.

302, and 323 × 399 μm2 [see Fig. 6(a)].
A 55-nm-thick SiO2 gate-oxide layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 200 ◦C and then covered by an evaporated ﬁlm of Ti/Au serving as the gate [26] [see Fig. 6(b)].
For the experiments presented here, this gate was not connected.
The motion of domain walls (DWs) in the bilayer was observed through the square part of the Ti/Au gate [see the bottom left of Fig. 6(a)].
Finally, Ti (20 nm)/Au (200 nm) electrode bars of width 40 μm were deposited onto the GaAs cap on both sides of the rectangle to connect the ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As/(Ga,Mn)(As,P) bilayer.
Those electrodes were used to generate a homogeneous current density in the direc- tion of the largest length of rectangles.
The current ﬂows only within the (Ga,Mn)As/(Ga,Mn)(As,P) bilayer, since the em- bedding media are undoped GaAs layers with a much larger resistivity.
Therefore, the motion of DW produced by the cur- rent is due to the spin-transfer torque (STT).
The measurement of velocity was always performed from an initially almost ﬂat magnetic domain wall aligned in the direction parallel to the Ti/Au electrodes (i.e., perpendicular to direction of electric current), as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(c).
The displacement of DW to a new position [see Fig. 6(d)] was produced by FIG.

(b) Normal- ized temperature rise for a 1 GA/m2 pulse for the device (228 × 302 μm2) connected to the current source (solid diamonds) and for a device with the same dimensions placed ∼1 mm away (empty diamonds).
The solid line corresponds to the best ﬁt of the function T (t, 1GA/m2) = aTb for t < 50 s. magnetic ﬁeld pulses (amplitude from 0 to 65 mT and duration t = 1 μs up to 100 s) or current pulses (amplitude from 0.02 to 9.70 GA/m2 and t = 1 μs to 60 s).
The displacement of DW u(x) was measured in the direction of current and could vary along the DW line x (as observed in Figs. 6(e) and 2).
The velocity is deﬁned as the ratio between the average DW displacement and the pulse duration [⟨u⟩/t].
APPENDIX B: CONTRIBUTION OF JOULE HEATING TO DW DYNAMICS In order to determine the temperature rise produced by current pulses and to conﬁrm a negligible contribution of Joule heating to DW dynamics we have followed a similar analysis as that proposed in Ref. [34].
For each measurement, we prepare an initial mag- netic state consisting in a closed magnetic domain sur- rounded by a homogeneous reversed magnetization.
First, we determine the critical (Curie) temperature at which the 184420-6COMMON UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR OF MAGNETIC DOMAIN … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) FIG. 8.
Roughness exponent vs time for ﬁeld-induced DW motion.

contrast of the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect vanishes (Tc = 65 K) by progressively increasing the temperature.
Then, the experimental protocol used for measuring the tem- perature rise T produced by current pulses is as follows: Step 1.
We set an initial sample temperature Ti.
This ﬁxes the temperature rise (Tc = Tc −Ti) required to reach the temperature Tc. Step 2.
We choose a value for the current density j.
We then apply a pulse of duration t which produces a tem- perature rise T ( j, t).
If T ( j, t) < Tc, the magnetic domain is still visible after the pulse; the sample has remained in the ferromagnetic state during the pulse.
In contrast, if T ( j, t) > Tc, the Joule heating has produced a transi- tion to the paramagnetic state and the domain is no longer observed after the current pulse.
In order to estimate the value of the critical pulse duration tc for which T ( j, tc) = Tc, we progressively increase the pulse duration until the vanishing of the magnetic domain. Step 3.
Step 2 is repeated for different values of the current density j and the same temperature rise Tc. Step 4.
Steps 1–3 are repeated for different values of Tc.
For each value of current density, this procedure enables one to associate a temperature rise T ( j, tc) to a pulse duration tc as shown in Fig. 7(a).
In order to verify that the obtained curves reﬂect the contribution of Joule heating, the temperature rises were divided by j2.
As it can be observed in Fig. 7(b), all the data points collapse onto a single master curve, which conﬁrms our assumption.
The master curve corresponds to the time variation of the temperature rise T produced by a current pulse of amplitude j = 1GA/m2.
Moreover, the same type of measurement was performed for a device separated by ∼1 mm from the heating source.

Roughness exponent vs time for current-induced DW motion.
(a)–(l) Temporal evolution of the roughness exponent at different temperatures and constant current density within the creep regime.
In every case j jd < 1.
The average ζJ is indicated for each temperature.
In this case, the heat is transferred through the substrate of bilayer devices.
Therefore, the vanishing of the domain is assigned exclusively to temperature rise and cannot be asso- ciated to current-induced DW motion.
As shown in Fig. 7(b), the obtained curve has a similar shape.
The temperature rise presents a strong variation for the shortest duration (t < 50 s).
For t > 50 s, the temperature rise tends to saturate, which probably reﬂects a quasithermal equilibrium controlled by the power produced by Joule heating, the cooling power of the cryostat, and the thermal impedance of the sample and substrate.
Let us now discuss the contribution of Joule heating to DW dynamics.
We ﬁrst seek for a continuous function de- scribing the temperature rise for t < 50 s.
Arbitrarily, we have chosen a power-law variation T ( j = 1GA/m2, t) = a(t)b with a = 0.78 ± 0.13 and b = 0.69 ± 0.05, which ﬁts the data [see Fig. 7(b)] rather accurately.
Then, we have calculated the temperature rise for each pulse amplitude and duration used for the velocity measurements.
The obtained maximum temperature rise is T ⩽0.3 K. The correspond- ing maximum velocity variation is v( j,T )−v( j,T +0.3 K) v( j,T ) ≈3%.
A comparison with the log-log scale velocity curves presented in the main text for different temperatures directly shows that Joule heating produces an insigniﬁcant contribution to DW dynamics.
APPENDIX C: STATISTICAL STUDY OF ROUGHNESS EXPONENT The roughness exponents for the magnetic ﬁeld (ζH)- and current (ζj)-driven DW wall were determined systematically from time sequences of DW displacement, similar to those shown in the Fig. 1 of the main text.
Figures 8 and 9 show the time evolution of ζH and ζj, respectively, for different 184420-8COMMON UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR OF MAGNETIC DOMAIN … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 100, 184420 (2019) temperatures in the range 5.7 K < T < 59.0 K. As it can be observed, ζH is found to be globally independent of time, except for some experiments [see Figs. 8(e), 8(i), and 8(j)] for which a variation is observed close to t = 0 s.
Similarly, ζj remains constant with time, which indicates that the faceting (tilting) of DWs observed in Fig. 1(b) produces no signiﬁcant change of the measured value of ζj [see Fig. 9(f)].
The rough- ness exponent values ζH = 0.61 ± 0.03 and ζj = 0.60 ± 0.05 discussed in the paper are both averages over more than 350 measurements.
