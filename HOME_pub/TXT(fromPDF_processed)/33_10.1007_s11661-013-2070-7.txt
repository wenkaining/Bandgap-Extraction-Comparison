Effects of Thermal and Cryogenic Conditionings on Flexural Behavior of Thermally Shocked Cu-Al2O3 Micro and NanoComposites KHUSHBU DASH, SUJATA PANDA, and BANKIM CHANDRA RAY This investigation has used ﬂexural test to explore the eﬀects of thermal treatments, i.e., high- temperature and cryogenic environments on the mechanical property of Al2O3 particulate- reinforced Cu metal matrix micro and nanocomposites in ex-situ and in-situ conditions. Cu-5 vol.
pct Al2O3 micro (10 lm)- and nanocomposites (<50 nm) fabricated by powder metallurgy route were subjected to up-thermal shock cycle [193 K to 353 K (80 C to 80 C)] and down-thermal shock cycle [353 K to 193 K (from 80 C to 80 C)] for diﬀerent time periods followed by 3-point bend test.
One batch of specimens (micro and nanocomposites) was conditioned at 353 K and 193 K (80 C and 80 C) separately followed by 3-point ﬂexural test.
High-temperature ﬂexural test was performed at 373 K and 523 K (80 C and 250 C) on the micro and nanocomposites.
All the fractured samples obtained after various thermal treatments were studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM).
The development of thermal stresses quite often results in concentration of residual stresses at the particle/matrix interface eventually weakening it.
Enhancement of ﬂexural strength was recorded for down- as well as for up-thermal shock in microcomposites.
The high-temperature ﬂexural strengths of micro and nanocomposites are lower than those at ambient temperature.
The amelioration and declination in mechanical properties as a consequence of thermal shock, thermal conditioning, and high-temperature ﬂexural testing have been discussed in the light of fractography.

INTRODUCTION METAL matrix composites (MMCs) are excellent candidates for structural components in the aerospace and automotive industries because of their high speciﬁc modulus, strength, and thermal stability.[1] MMCs show a combination of mechanical stiﬀness (reinforcement), a relatively low density and a high damping capacity (matrix).
This combination makes it an attractive material for aerospace and relatively high-temperature applications.
Strengthening of MMCs depends on the character and architecture of its constituents: the matrix and the reinforcement.
Diﬀerential thermal expansion is a prime cause of development of thermal stresses in composite materials.
The thermal stresses generated depend on the reinforce- ment volume fraction, reinforcement geometry, and thermal expansion coeﬃcient mismatch.[2,3] Most rein- forcements are elastic up to their fracture point, while the matrix undergoes plastic deformation.[4] Processing induced reactions and thermal stresses can cause changes in the matrix microstructure.
These microstruc- tural changes in the matrix in turn can aﬀect the mechanical and physical behavior of the composite.
The mechanical properties of the composite depend on the relaxation mechanism of these thermal stresses.
When the thermal stresses accumulated are high enough to exceed the elastic limit of the matrix, dislocations are produced in the vicinity of the reinforcement.[5–7] A signiﬁcant thermal expansion mismatch may result in decohesion at the particle/matrix interface and/or a possible matrix cracking, particle fragmentation because of thermal stress.[8] Such a concentration of thermal stresses around defects (second-phase particles) often results in catastrophic failure of the composite.[9] Zhou et al.[9] reported that the initial crack occurs in the notched-tip region, wherein the initial crack is induced by void nucleation, growth, and subsequent coalescence in the matrix materials or interface separation.
Improvements of fracture toughness are also ascribed to the mechanisms of crack blunting, shielding, and crack deﬂection accompanied by particle pull out.
The performance of particle-reinforced composite is often controlled by the adhesion theories at the particle/ matrix mating surfaces.
Thermal expansion coeﬃcients of metals are substantially greater compared with ceramics, leading to either enhancement or degradation of proximal contact between particle and matrix occur- ring under the inﬂuence of temperature gradient.[10] The 3-point ﬂexural test results may reﬂect the tendency of KHUSHBU DASH, Research Scholar, and BANKIM CHANDRA RAY, Professor, are with the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 769008.

A need probably exists for an assessment of mechanical performance of such composites under the inﬂuence of thermal shock.
Thermal stresses caused by temperature gradient should be given special attention in many application areas.
A better understanding of interfacial properties and assessment of interfacial strength can help in evaluating the mechanical behavior of particle-reinforced MMC materials.
It is important to experimentally assess the degree of degradative eﬀect of thermal conditioning during exposure to above-zero and subzero temperatures.
Ma et al.[11] studied the cryogenic properties and fracture behaviors of Al composites predicting the rise in tensile strength at cryogenic temperatures from the room temperature.
They have also illustrated diﬀerent fracture modes and features in cryogenic temperature range.
Poza et al.[12] investigated the fracture mechanisms of Al composites at cryogenic and elevated temperatures.
The fracture characters at elevated temperatures are dominated by interfacial decohesion rather than the reinforcement particle frac- ture.
High thermal conductivity of copper makes it a potential candidate for heat conduction applications in aerospace and automobile components.
The high con- duction coupled with high strength would complete the requirements for a high conduction–high strength mate- rial.
These components often experience high tempera- ture on one surface and cryogenic environment on the other end.[13] The copper-alumina combination needs to be understood for the super critical applications in the aerospace industry.
There is a paucity of literature in this ﬁeld; however; this investigation would lead to a comprehensive study of the composite with particle size variation.
The advancement of science and technology has been rapidly demanding newer materials which can endure extreme weathering exposures and excursion.
This may necessitate the design of experimental process and procedures to generate data and ﬁndings which would lead to the prediction of reliability of mechanical performance of material behavior in unpredictably harsh and hostile environments.
In this investigation, we have subjected the Cu-Al2O3 micro and nanocom- posites to diﬀerent thermal treatment modules which consist of thermal shock treatment, thermal condition- ing, and high-temperature ﬂexural testing.
Boccacini et al.[14] have shown that thermal cycling and thermal fatigue in MMCs (in Mg-Al alloy system) leads to decrease in elastic modulus and density; these thermal stresses can be relieved by plastic deformation of matrix, cracking, and debonding at interface followed by void formation.
The Al alloy–SiC composites show cracks in response to repeated thermal cycling, and the microhardness decreases with the increasing number of thermal cycles.
The interfacial cracks lead to a decrease in mechanical performance.
The matrix–particle inter- facial decohesion plays a major role in the deterioration of mechanical property than the damage accumula- tion.[15] Al/SiC p composites subjected to thermal cycling and its behavior was studied.
Complex disloca- tion interactions take place during thermal cycling.[16] Dislocation debris and curved dislocation segments near particle matrix interface indicate relaxation.
Magnesium alloy reinforced with carbon ﬁbers was fabricated via gas pressure inﬁltration technique and had been subjected to thermal shocks at temperatures ranging from 173 K to 373 K (+100 C to 100 C).
The number of thermal cycles has been varied from 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, to 100 cycles followed by ﬂexural tests.
Bending modulus, ILSS values, and microhardness values were studied after thermal cycling.
Variation in microhardness symbolizes work hardening, viscolelastic recovery, or aging.
Thermal cycling led to mechanical damage via microcracks, microvoids, and ﬁber protru- sion by interfacial sliding.[17] II.
EXPERIMENTAL A. Fabrication of Composites Copper powder (Loba Chemie) (average particle size ~11 lm , purity— >99.7 pct) (trace impurities: P, Sb, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ag, and Sn) was used as the matrix material.
Alumina powders (Sigma Aldrich) (average particle size ~10 lm and <50 nm) were selected as the reinforcement material.
The Cu-5 pct Al2O3 (10 lm ) microcomposites and Cu-5 pct Al2O3 (<50 nm) nano- composites powders were blended separately.
The spec- imens having dimensions (31.5 9 12.7 9 6.3 mm3) were prepared by compacting the powders at a pressure of 500 MPa as per ASTM B 925-08 for 3-point ﬂexural test.
The compacted specimens were sintered conven- tionally at 1173 K (900 C) for 90 minutes in argon atmosphere.
Three specimens were tested at each point of experimental condition under ﬂexural loading.
The averages of two and/or three closer values of ﬂexural test data were chosen for indicating the nature of variation.
B. Ex-situ Thermal Treatment The 3-point ﬂexural test standard specimens were subjected to thermal shock environment with a 433 K (160 C) temperature gradient by two separate routes.
Thermal shock treatments of the micro and nanocom- posites were done from 353 K (+80 C) to 193 K (80 C) (down-thermal shock) for one batch of spec- imens, and in the reverse order (up-thermal shock) for another batch of specimens in three diﬀerent modules explained in Table I.
After each thermal shock treat- ment, 3-point ﬂexural test of each sample was performed immediately in an universal testing machine (Instron- 5967) at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min maintaining a span length of 26 mm.
Choice of temperatures between 353 K and 193 K (+80 C and 80 C) was made to promote accelerated weathering which readily induces signiﬁcant scale of damage and development in shorter span of time; these accelerated weathering data may be used to predict long-term durability for appli- cation at higher temperatures than 193 K (80 C).
The same is true for 353 K (+80 C).
In order to treat the samples for thermal conditioning, the samples were 1568—VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS Acategorized into three groups.
The ﬁrst group was treated at 353 K (+80 C) in muﬄe furnace for 60 minutes isothermally.
The blower of the furnace was used for heat circulation and uniform heating of the samples.
The second set of samples were treated at 193 K (80 C) in an ultralow-temperature chamber for 60 minutes by isothermal holding.
The third batch of samples was maintained at ambient temperature.
3- point ﬂexural test was conducted immediately at room temperature after each thermal conditioning treatment.
The loading rate and span length was maintained at 0.5 mm/min and 26 mm, respectively, for all the 3-point bend tests.
C. High Temperature Flexural Testing High-temperature 3-point ﬂexural test was carried out at temperatures of 373 K and 523 K (100 C and 250 C) on the micro and nanocomposites.
The samples were kept inside the furnace chamber, and the furnace was allowed to reach the required temperature.
The 3-point ﬂexural test was conducted just after the temperature attainment.
D. SEM Analysis The fracture surface of the all 3-point ﬂexural test sam- ples were observed under scanning electron microscopy Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The densiﬁcation of Cu-5 pct Al2O3 microcomposite is 91.04 pct of theoretical density whereas the densiﬁcation of Cu-5 pct Al2O3 nanocomposite is 85.2 pct of theoretical density measured by Archimedes method.
The micro- structures of Cu-5 pct Al2O3 microcomposites before and after down thermal shock treatment have been illustrated in Figure 1.
The fabricated microcomposites show good dispersion of alumina particles in copper matrix, whereas the down-thermal shock treated microcomposites show particle cracking and particle pull out too.
Figure 2 shows micrographs of Cu-5 pct Al2O3 nanocomposites before and after down-thermal shock treatment.
The nanocom- posite before treatment has been marked with alumina nanoparticles which show almost uniform distribution.
The microstructure of nanocomposite after down-ther- mal shock shows pulled out agglomerated particle resting on the matrix.
Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the reason- ably visible uniform distribution of pores throughout the composite system.
The objective of this investigation is to assess the variation in mechanical property with the thermal treatments, but not so much emphasis on evaluating the absolute values of mechanical properties.
The absolute value of diﬀerent properties might diﬀer with the route of fabrication techniques.
A. Thermal Shock The responses to thermal shock in Cu-5 vol pct Al2O3 microcomposites and nanocomposites have been assessed from the ﬂexural strength on the basis of the Fig. 2—SEM micrographs of Cu-5 pct Al2O3 nanocomposite (left) before any thermal treatment (right) after down-thermal shock (right ﬁgure currently under consideration for the proceedings of International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials 2013).

Figure 3(a) represents the ultimate ﬂexural strength of the composite under various thermal shock exposures.
The specimens were subjected to up- thermal shock [treated at 193 K (80 C) ﬁrst, followed by 353 K (80 C)] and down-thermal shock [treated initially at 353 K (80 C) and then at 193 K (80 C)] for various exposure times, which have been elaborated in Table I. 1.
Microcomposite Figure 3(a) shows the eﬀect of thermal conditioning on ultimate ﬂexural strength of thermally shocked (up- thermal and down-thermal shock) Cu-Al2O3 micro and nanocomposites.
The trend of the increasing ﬂexural strength of microcomposites under subjection of ther- mal shock is time dependent which is quite clear from Figure 3(a).
There is an increment of 21.95 pct in ﬂexural strength value for the up-thermal shock treat- ment in module-1, whereas down-thermal shock treat- ment increases the bending strength value by 29.69 pct, as illustrated in Figure 3(b).
The fracture surface illus- trated in Figure 4(a) symbolizes the microcomposite tested at ambient conditions.
The down-thermal shock, [i.e., 353 K to 193 K (80 C to 80 C)] promoted the intimate physical bonding of reinforcement matrix.
The reason could be attributed to the following: at 353 K (80 C), the matrix around the alumina particles expands, and it imparts a compressive force on the alumina particle which could lead to particle fragmen- tation sometimes [Figure 4(b)].[18] This also leads to better mechanical interlocking of the particle with the matrix.[19] while, on the contrary, when cooling occurs from the processing temperature during fabrication of the composite, the matrix shrinks around the reinforce- ment particle rendering residual tensile stresses/strains in the matrix and compressive stresses/strains in the reinforcement.[20] The increase in ﬂexural strength of down-thermally shocked microcomposite is slightly higher than that in up-thermal shock because the prior conditioning eﬀect predominates over the later shock (which means that the thermal shock [from 353 K to 193 K (80 C to 80 C)] is manifested as prior condi- tioning at 353 K (80 C) followed by immediate expo- sure to 193 K (80 C), i.e., the specimen was conditioned at 353 K(80 C) for 1 hour and then immediately exposed to 193 K (80 C).
Thus, the prior thermally conditioned specimen has experienced a thermal shock of 433 K (160 C)).
When the microcom- posites are subjected to up-thermal shock [i.e., 193 K to 353 K (80 C to 80 C)], the contraction of matrix (copper) takes place to a larger extent than for the reinforcement particle (alumina).
The reason for this could be the higher coeﬃcient of thermal expansion of copper (16.6 9 106 k1) than alumina (5.4 9 106 k1), which also aids in the presence of dislocation density at the interface.[21] This may lead to physical decohesion [Figure 4(c)] at the particle/matrix conjunction which has been observed earlier by Ray et al.[10] in inorganic ﬁber/polymer composite.
The dislocations present in the reinforcement proximity also get pinned down when the composite is subjected to 193 K (80 C).
The pinning of dislocations strengthens the composite by resisting the plastic ﬂow of the matrix.[22] The interfacial decohesion which had possibly occurred at ultralow temperature [Figure 2(c)] could not be restored at 353 K (80 C) on the same scale.
The conditioning at 193 K (80 C) for 60 minutes might have created a large interfacial mismatch at the interface which is manifested by the presence of diﬀerential coeﬃcient of thermal expansion between copper matrix and alumina reinforcement particles.[19] 2.
Nanocomposite The ultimate ﬂexural strength value decreases for up- thermal shock, whereas the strength values increases for down-thermal shock which is conﬁrmed from Fig- ures 5(a) and (b).
In up-thermal shock, the matrix in the vicinity of the particle contracts at 193 K (80 C) possibly leading to interfacial decohesion.

METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014—1571area of the nanoparticles being higher, the degree of de- union anticipated is also high rendering the interfacial bond weak.
The above being a physical phenomenon cannot be reversed/restored at 353 K (80 C), and hence, the ultimate ﬂexural strength decreases.
The surface deactivation of alumina nanoparticles which took place at 193 K (80 C) was unlikely to be restored at 353 K (80 C).
The adverse eﬀect of prior thermal conditioning treatment on the composites is not being reversibly reinstated by the subsequent treatment; this could be a possible reason for the reduced value of ﬂexural strength.
In down-thermal shock, the degree of physical contact of matrix and the reinforced nanoparticle increases at 353 K (80 C).
[The expansivity of copper matrix is much higher compared with alumina particle.
Hence, the expansion of matrix onto the particle at 353 K (80 C) leads to enhanced gripping of alumina by the matrix.
This enhanced proximity leads to mechanical strengthening of the interface which is reﬂected by the increased ﬂexural strength values.] The improved integrity can also be attributed to the enhanced surface diﬀusivity of nanoparticles at high temperature.
The physical integrity of copper and alumina has been shown by ﬂexural strength.
Nanopar- ticles have high surface energy leading to high surface diﬀusivity.
At high temperature, it is reasonable to expect that the surface diﬀusivity of nanoparticles gets improved, and at subzero temperature, surface diﬀusiv- ity gets reduced, as diﬀusion is a temperature-dependent phenomenon.
The ultimate ﬂexural strength increases because of the high surface area of nanoparticles, and hence, lead, to enhanced interaction of nanoparticles with the matrix at high temperature.
Later, the exposure at 193 K (80 C) could not induce damage on the same scale as the prior treatment at 353 K (80 C).
The fracture surface of the nanocomposite after down-thermal shock [Figure 6(a)] shows some tear ridges.
Figures 6(b) and (c) shows the load–displacement curve for micro and nanocomposites tested at ambient temperature.
The Al/AlN composites were prepared by squeeze casting, and were solution treated at 803 K (530 C) and quenched in water for 2 hours followed by aging for 10 hours at 433 K (160 C).
Thermal cycling led to increase in tensile strength, elastic limit, and yield strength, and the overall property’s stability of the composites which is in accordance with our case, where ﬂexural strength increases with thermal shock treat- ment.[23] Bhattacharya et al. have reported the increase in microhardness and decrease in density (due to formation of voids) after thermal cycling in Al-SiC composites.[24] Cracks at the interface have been observed because of thermal strain in the composite in the clustered region of reinforcement.
Our investigation also reports particle cracking after thermal shock treatment.
B. Thermal Conditioning 1.
Microcomposite At 353 K (80 C), the ultimate ﬂexural strength of microcomposite decreases by 29.27 pct when compared to the untreated sample.
The 3-point ﬂexural strength values at various conditioning temperatures are illus- trated in Figure 7(a).
As the expanding elastic matrix imparts a compressive force on the reinforcement particle, this results in particle fragmentation [abun- Fig. 4—SEM micrograph illustrating the thermally shocked 3-point bend test specimen fracture surface of microcomposites (a) no treatment (b) down-thermal shock (c) up-thermal shock.
1572—VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS Adantly visible in SEM micrograph Figure 7(b)] which leads to composite softening.
This diﬀerential expansion also leads to localized stresses and strain ﬁelds in the microcomposite.[25] The ultra-low-temperature condi- tioning at 193 K (80 C) may render shrinkage of matrix which causes interfacial decohesion [Figure 7(c)] decreasing the ﬂexural strength of microcomposite by 0.93 pct.
At low temperature, the degree of contraction of matrix is higher than the reinforcement particle shrinkage.
As the probability of particle cracking decreases, this results in decrease of the detrimental softening eﬀect.
Hence, the decrease in ultimate ﬂexural strength is less pronounced as compared to the 353 K (80 C) conditioning. 2.
Nanocomposite At 353 K (80 C), the ultimate ﬂexural strength increases by 15.60 pct in comparison to the untreated sample (Figure 8).
The nano alumina particles impede the dislocation motion leading to the dislocation pileups at the reinforcement particle–matrix boundary, which leads to strain hardening of the composite.
The enhanced surface diﬀusivity of nanoparticles at high temperature could be another reason for proﬁcient interfacial interaction and subsequent composite strengthening.
On the contrary the ultralow-temperature conditioning of the nanocomposite at 193 K (80 C) decreases the composite strength by 26.31 pct.
As the movement of dislocations is a temperature-driven phe- nomena, at low temperature, the movement of disloca- tions get arrested which restricts the dislocation pile up consequently decreasing the density of dislocation for- est.[26] At low temperature, the surface diﬀusivity of alumina nanoparticles is quite likely to get lowered in comparison to enhanced diﬀusivity at high temperature, hence the thermal conditioning eﬀect in nanocomposites is pronounced.
C. High Temperature 3-Point Bend Test 1.
Microcomposite At 373 K (100 C), the copper matrix expands result- ing in tensile and compressive stress in the matrix and reinforcement, respectively, enhancing the mechanical interlocking between matrix and reinforcement.[27] This leads to the direct strengthening of the composite and as a result the ultimate ﬂexural strength of the composite increases by 18.12 pct from the ambient test value [illustrated in Figure 9(a)].
At 523 K (250 C), the ultimate ﬂexural strength values decreases by 20.56 pct from the room tempera- ture test value.
At higher operating temperatures, plasticity of the composite increases because of (1) dislocation annihilation (2) activation of dislocation motion by diﬀerent mechanism other than glide (3) relaxation of internal stress at the matrix–particle front, (4) enhancement of dislocation recovery at the inter- face.[28] All the above stated phenomena cause to decrease the strain hardening exponent of the composite leading to decrease in ultimate ﬂexural strength of the composite.
The fracture surfaces [revealed from Fig- ures 9(b) and (c)] illustrate ample number of particle pull-out of alumina particles possibly because of matrix softening.[12] 2.
Nanocomposite With the increasing operating temperature, the strength of the Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite decreases by 1.08 pct at 373 K (100 C) and 20.05 pct at 523 K (250 C) [Figure 10(a)].
With the increasing operating temperature, the strengthening mechanisms that operate at low temperature get relaxed which decrease in the strength of the composite.[27] The fractography studies reveal that the fracture mode of the nanocomposite at 373 K (100 C) is of ductile type [Figure 10(b)] whereas the failure characteristic features of the composite at 523 K (250 C) can be characterized by dimple mark- ings (matrix softening at elevated temperature).
The nanocomposites do not show pronounced dimples in ambient conditions of testing, whereas at high temper- Fig. 5—(a) Comparison of ultimate ﬂexural stress (MPa) value for up-thermal shock and down-thermal shock of nanocomposites trea- ted in diﬀerent treatment modules.
(b) Percentage of increment in ultimate ﬂexural stress (MPa) value for up-thermal shock and down- thermal shock with respect to ambient values of nanocomposites treated in diﬀerent treatment module.
METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014—1573ature of testing, the presence of dimples suggest matrix softening to a certain extent.
Uematsu et al. subjected Al-SiC composites to high- temperature testing, showing decrease in tensile strength with the increasing testing temperatures such as 423 K and 523 K (150 C and 250 C).[29] The fracture surface indicated particle fracture and particle/matrix crack initiations due to softening of matrix at high tempera- ture which is in agreement with our results.
D. Comparison of Behavior of Differently Treated Composites The current investigation has largely emphasized the study of damage and/or development of ﬂexural prop- erties under the condition of up-thermal and down- thermal shocks.
The experiment has further focused on the variation of ﬂexural behavior by the imposition of thermal conditioning and high-temperature exposure on micro and nanoparticle-embedded Cu-based compos- ites. 1.
Thermal Shock The composites are exposed to temperature gradient of 433 K (160 C) [from 353 K to 193 K (80 C to 80 C), i.e., down-thermal shock, and from 193 K to 353 K (80 C to 80 C), i.e., up-thermal shock].
This thermal shock experiment revealed that the ﬂexural strength of microcomposites increases after down- as well up-thermal shock treatments.
For the nanocom- Fig. 6—(a) SEM micrographs illustrating the thermally shocked 3-point bend test specimen fracture surface of nanocomposites down-thermal shock.
(b) Load–displacement curve for Cu-5 pct Al2O3 microcomposite tested at ambient conditions.
(c) Load–displacement curve for Cu-5 pct Al2O3 nanocomposite tested at ambient conditions.
1574—VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS Aposites, there is an incremental improvement in ﬂexural strength after down-thermal shock conditioning, whereas the decrease of its value has been observed after up-thermal shock treatment.
The larger surface/volume ratio of alumina nanopar- ticles in comparison with microparticles implies more surface area contact with the copper matrix for the former.
The implications of thermal treatments for both the up-and down-thermal shocks are likely to aﬀect more particle/matrix interfaces in nanoparticle-embed- ded copper matrix system.
Thus, it may reasonably be proposed that the diﬀerential coeﬃcient thermal expan- sion of copper and alumina may manifest larger amount of interfacial damage in nanosystem, because of an exposure to a temperature gradient in a short span of time.
That is why more degradation has been observed in nanocomposites.
The enhancement of property has also been observed in few cases for both the systems.
This may be manifested by an improvement in mechanical interlock- ing factor.
This improvement in interlocking factor may sometimes get nulliﬁed and/or diminished during expo- sure in an opposite direction of thermal cycling.
These contradictory and inconclusive natures of behaviour might be attributed to the generation of opposite and complex residual stresses during exposure to high- to low and low- to high temperature cycles. 2.
Thermal Conditioning The specimens had experienced temperatures of 353 K and 193 K (80 C and 80 C) separately, which were conditioned at these temperatures for an hour.
The microcomposites reﬂect a decrease in ﬂexural strength after 353 K (80 C) conditioning.
Nanocomposites show an increase in ﬂexural value at 353 K (80 C), and a decrease at 193 K (80 C) temperature conditioning, respectively.
The reduction in mechanical property during cryo- genic conditioning may be attributed to the decohesion Fig. 7—(a) Plot for ultimate ﬂexural stress (MPa) vs. thermal conditioning temperature for microcomposites.

METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 45A, MARCH 2014—1575between alumina particle and copper matrix in nano- composites.
This might have been manifested because of large diﬀerence in coeﬃcients of thermal contraction between particle and matrix.
The high-temperature exposure of nanocomposites has demonstrated an increase in mechanical property.
It may be reasonably assumed that the diﬀerential expan- sion may be leading to better particle matrix registry, and thereby closer proximity is ensured.
The lower surface area/volume ratio of microparticle in comparison to the nanoparticle-embedded copper matrix has shown no signiﬁcant changes for cryogenic temperature conditioning and a decline in ﬂexural strength at high-temperature conditioning.
The forced close intimacy of the alumina microparticle and matrix at high temperature leads to a development of residual stresses at the particle/matrix interfacial region.
This nonuniform distribution of residual stresses may de- crease the threshold value of crack nucleation and propagation along the particle/matrix interface region.
The diﬀerential coeﬃcient of thermal expansion between alumina particle and copper matrix has lesser impact and implications in terms of either in advancement or declination of mechanical properties in microalumina- reinforced copper composites.
3. High-Temperature Flexural Test The composites were tested at 373 K and 523 K (100 C and 250 C) , and these temperatures were maintained as constant throughout the experiment.
The increase in ﬂexural strength at 373 K (100 C) and decrease in ﬂexural strength at 523 K (250 C) reﬂect the poor high-temperature sustainability of microcompos- ites.
The nancomposites also reveal low ﬂexural strength at 523 K (250 C).
The increase in ﬂexural strength at 373 K (100 C) is due to the eﬀective gripping of alumina particle and copper matrix due to relatively higher expansion of copper than alumina.
The residual stress development triggers the forced close registry between particle and matrix imposed by high-temperature [523 K (250 C)] conditioning.
This may not be conducive for the generated residual stresses to be distributed properly and uniformly.
These accumulated, nonuniform residual stresses may decrease the threshold values of crack nucleation and propagation along the particle/matrix interface region. IV.
CONCLUSIONS The micro and nanocomposites of Copper with 5 vol.
pct alumina were fabricated by conventional powder metallurgy route.
Both up- and down-thermal shock treatments enhance the ultimate ﬂexural strength of Cu- Al2O3 microcomposites.
The variation of ﬂexural strength is contradictory, and far from comprehen- sive conclusion in Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites.

At high operating temperatures [i.e., 523 K (250 C)], the ulti- mate ﬂexural strengths of both Cu-Al2O3 micro and nanocomposites decrease.
SEM micrographs reveal ductile modes of fracture for both micro and nanocom- posites.
Ductile fracture characteristics have been observed predominantly for Cu-Al2O3 microcomposites.
Fracture characters visible in Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites indicate ductile mode of failure.
The nanoparticles in nanocomposites have higher surface area compared with microparticles in microcomposites.
Hence, the ther- mal shock-induced stress in nanocomposites is more visible in terms of degradation and enhancement of ﬂexural strength.
The development and detoriation of physical integrity of composite is more predominant in nanocomposites than in microcomposites.
Notice- able diﬀerences in the ﬂexural strength and response to thermal exposures of the micro and nanocompos- ites have been observed, and have been explained in terms of diﬀerences in their fracture surface micro- structures.
