The surface electronic state showed quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) dispersion curves and a nearly metallic character; the top of the holelike band is just below the Fermi level.
The size of the Rashba parameter αR reached a much larger value (∼5.5 eV ˚A) than for previously reported 1D systems.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.98.075431 I. INTRODUCTION Spin-polarized electronic states without ferromagnetic ma- terials, such as the spin-split low-dimensional states due to the Rashba effect [1] and topological surface states [2], have been studied extensively for future application to spintronics [3].
Among them, one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D (Q1D) states are regarded as promising systems because of various merits such as possible downsizing of the system and highly efﬁcient suppression of backscattering.
Recently, spin-split (Q)1D states have attracted much attention in basic science re- searchtorealizeexoticelectronicphenomenasuchasMajorana bound states [4] and spin-dependent density-wave formation [5].
Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction (SOI) causes spin-split two-dimensional (2D; or 1D) electronic states in a low- dimensional system without space-inversion symmetry, e.g., in crystal surfaces.
Since it causes no ferromagnetic order, time-reversal symmetry remains even with spin-split states.
Assuming a parabolic dispersion with spin splitting propor- tional to the wave vector k from the Kramers degeneracy point, the size of typical Rashba spin splitting can be expressed as E = 2αRk, where the proportionality constant αR is the so-called Rashba parameter, which is often used as a scale to estimate the size of Rashba SOI.
Both theoretical and experimental efforts for the spintronic application of such Rashba-split states were made in earlier days [6].
These days, giant Rashba spin splitting has been realized in both 2D [7–11] and three-dimensional (3D) [12] systems, where αR is 3–7 eV ˚A and spin-to-current conversion has been realized as the *y_oh@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp †kimura@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp ﬁrst step toward practical spintronic application using such Rashba-split states [13].
However, despite the extensive studies and fascinating theoretical prospects introduced above, a quest for (Q)1D states with giant Rashba splitting has been the challenge for surface science in this decade, after the discovery of the 2D ones [7,8].
Although some Q1D systems with Rashba splitting are known, such as Au and Pb on vicinal Si surfaces [14–17], Pt/Si(110) [18], the 1D step edge of Bi thin ﬁlms [19], and Pt/Ge(001) [20], their Rashba parameters are, at most, ∼1.4 eV ˚A, which is much smaller than those of their giant Rashba counterparts in 2D and 3D systems.
Various theoretical studies to achieve a larger Rashba SOI have been reported so far [21–28], and many parameters have been proposed as the origin of the giant Rashba effect, such as the asymmetric charge distribution in the proximity of surface atoms [21,24], orbital-angular-momentum polarization [25], and hybridization between different atomic orbitals [22,27,28].
Although it is difﬁcult to reach a ﬁrm conclusion from such a long debate, some clues can be obtained from these studies.
First, the target electronic state should be derived from heavy elements whose nucleus potential causes a large SOI.
Second, the state should be quite different from nearly-free-electron (NFE) isotropic wave functions, since the Rashba SOIs for such NFE states are simulated to be very small by using all the theoretical models.
The Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) surface was extensively studied in the 1990s as a typical ordered metal-semiconductor interface [29–31].
The detailed surface atomic structure was determined by surface x-ray diffraction [30] to be strongly buckled zigzag Bi chains, as shown in Fig. 1(a).
Previous studies also re- ported a small density of states around the Fermi level EF, suggesting metallic surface states [31].
This surface is formed by heavy Bi atoms and has a Q1D atomic structure, implying anisotropic surface states away from the NFE case.

Both patterns were taken at room temperature.
Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) is one of the promising surfaces to real- ize large Rashba-type spin splitting in a Q1D system.
However, despite these properties, no research has been reported so far about the detailed surface-band dispersion, especially focused on possible spin-split structures, of the Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) surface.
In this paper, we report on the surface states of Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) and its spin-polarized structure through angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), spin- resolved ARPES (SARPES), and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculation.
The surface state showed highly anisotropic, Q1D dispersion around EF and a nearly metallic (semiconducting) character; the top of the holelike surface band is just below EF (∼50 meV).
The size of αR reached quite a large value (∼5.5 eV ˚A).
The results provide a promising foundation for studying the spin-split Q1D electronic states as well as for developing advanced spintronic devices. II.
METHODS A clean InAs(110) surface was prepared by cleaving the side face of InAs(001) substrates (nominally undoped) in ultrahigh-vacuum chambers.
As shown by the sharp and low- background low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern in Fig. 1(c), clean and well-deﬁned (110) surfaces were obtained by cleavage.
Then, Bi was evaporated from a Knudsen cell at room temperature.
Subsequent annealing at 563 K for 15 min produced the (2 × 1) surface, as indicated by the LEED pattern in Fig. 1(d).
The sample preparation procedure is the same as that reported in previous studies [29,31].
ARPES measurements were performed at BL-2A MUSASHI of the Photon Factory and BL5U of UVSOR-III with photon energies ranging from 50 to 85 eV. SARPES measurements were performed at the Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo, with linearly polarized photons by using a laser source (hν = 6.994 eV) [32].
Spin-integrated ARPES data were taken at the same time with both linearly and circularly polarized photons by laser for the sake of comparison.
For the SARPES measurements, the photon-incident plane was (001), and the electric-ﬁeld vector of the photons was normal to the incident plane (001).
The effective Sherman function of the spin detector was 0.27.
The energy resolutions and the positions of EF of both spin-integrated and spin-resolved ARPES were calibrated by the Fermi edge of a Cu block touching the sample.
The energy resolutions of both measurements were evaluated to be ∼20 meV. DFTcalculationwasperformedusingthe WIEN2Kcodewith SOI taken into account [33].
The Engel-Vosko generalized gradient approximation [34] was utilized to construct the exchange and correlation potentials.
The surface was modeled by an asymmetric slab of ten InAs layers with the surface covered by (2 × 1) zigzag Bi chains.
The surface atomic structure was energetically optimized down to the third In and As layers; the bottom of the slab was truncated from the bulk InAs structure and terminated by hydrogen atoms. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Surface electronic structure of Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) Figure 2(a) shows the ARPES constant-energy contour at a binding energy of 200 ± 10 meV. Here kx (ky) is deﬁned parallel to [¯110] ([001]).
The contour shows an anisotropic, Q1D shape with an open, waving contour along [001].
A waving feature in the energy contour indicates a small but ﬁnite 2D interaction between surface atomic chains.
Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show ARPES intensity plots along ¯- ¯X and ¯Y- ¯M, respectively.
The top of the hole bands lies slightly below EF, indicating a semiconducting character.
In general, such surface stateslyingaroundEF agreewellwithpreviousstudies[29,31].
The only difference is that these surface electronic states were reported to be metallic in previous studies.
However, the same (2 × 1) LEED patterns and spectral shapes [Fig. 3(c)] similar to those reported in Refs.
[29,31] suggest that the surface atomic structures are the same.
One possible reason for the discrepancy in the surface electronic states is that all the ARPES and SARPES measurements in this work were performed at low temperatures (15 to 40 K), in contrast to those at room temperature in previous studies.
At room temperature, the surface accumulation layer discussed above might supply carriers (holes in this case) to the surface states, making them metallic.
These results are quite encouraging for future work, especially on spin-dependent transport phenomena via the spin-split surface states on Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1), because the difference in results between the previous studies and this work indicates that the carrier amount in the surface state could be tuned by some properties such as sample temperature.

change depending on the photon energies, indicating that the Q1D bands are surface states without any dispersion along the surface normal.
In addition, a weak intensity appears around FIG.

A thick curve is a guide to the eye for the small electron pocket.
kx = 0.00 ˚A−1 at hν > 65 eV. This weak intensity would be due to the bottom of the bulk conduction band with 3D dispersion, as shown below.
Figure 3(a) shows ARPES intensity plots around ¯ taken with 74 eV. As indicated by the arrow, a metallic band forming a small electron pocket at ¯ is observed with hν = 74 eV but is absent with hν = 55 eV [see Fig. 2(b)].
The small MDC peaks at kx = 0 ˚A−1 in Fig. 2(d) (hν > 65 eV) correspond to the bottom of this small electron pocket.
In addition, a similar electron-pocket-like feature was observed in the ARPES intensity maps taken with a laser source [hν = 6.994 eV, Fig. 3(b)].
In order to trace this feature, the energy distribution curves at ¯ with photon energies from 50 to 80 eV are shown in Fig. 3(c).
This metallic feature appears at hν = 59 eV at EF and shows small dispersion depending on the photon energies, as indicated by a thick line in Fig. 3(c).
As shown there, this feature has a bottom at hν ∼70 eV (around 0.1 eV) and lies nearly at EF again at hν = 80 eV. Note that this feature is observed in wider energy range than those in Fig. 2(d) because the momentum-distribution curves in Fig. 2(d) are taken at 100 meV below EF.
This clear dependence on the incident photon energy indicates that this small electron pocket is a 3D band, perhaps the bottom of the 3D bulk conduction band.
Although the InAs substrates used in this work are nominally undoped, the surface preparation procedure, Bi evaporation, and subsequent annealing might form a p-type surface accumulation layer.
B. Spin splitting of the surface states A pair of parabolic surface bands separating with respect to kx = 0 ˚A−1 suggests the spin splitting due to Rashba-type 075431-3TAKUTO NAKAMURA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 98, 075431 (2018) FIG.

(e) The same as (d), but along ¯Y- ¯M. SOI [1].
In order to elucidate the spin texture of the surface states, SARPES measurements are desirable.
Before making the spin-polarization analysis, we show the correspondence of the spin-integrated and spin-resolved ARPES data with each other.
Figures 4(a)–4(c) show spin-integrated ARPES intensity plots by using a laser source (hν = 6.994 eV).
The obtained dispersion of the paired parabolic bands below EF agrees well with those observed by higher photon energies.
With linearly polarized photons, the photoelectron intensity in the vicinity of ¯ decreases because of the photoexcitation selection rule.
In Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), the ARPES peak positions obtained by synchrotron radiation (hν = 55 eV), laser (both spin-resolved and spin-integrated ones), and DFT calculations (from Fig. 6 in the next section) are plotted together.
All the ARPES and SARPES peaks agree well, suggesting that they originate from the same surface bands.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the SARPES energy distribution curves taken along ¯- ¯X and ¯Y- ¯M at 40 K, respectively.
The solid (open) triangles correspond to spin polarization parallel (antiparallel) to [001], the in-plane orientation perpendicular to kx.

proportional to kx), and the signs of the polarizations are the same along both ¯- ¯X and ¯Y- ¯M. C. Surface states obtained by DFT calculation Figure 6 shows the calculated surface electronic structure of the Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) surface.
A parabolic holelike dispersion, the top of which is around EF, is obtained, show- ing good qualitative agreement with the states observed by ARPES, even though the experimental EF is pinned near the bottom of the conduction band at ¯. Although the quantitative agreement is not perfect, as shown in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), such a small difference often occurs between DFT and ARPES due to various imperfections of the DFT calculation, such as thin slab thickness and a band-gap misestimation by the exchange-correlation functional.
The spin-polarized character of the calculated surface states also agrees well with the SARPES results.
The spin polarization of the surface states decreases signiﬁcantly in the vicinity of ¯ and ¯Y.
This could be due to the inﬂuence of other underlying surface states (∼0.4 eV at ¯ and ¯Y), which also have a large contribution from the surface Bi atoms with spin orientations opposite to those of the “upper” states.
Such spin-orbital interference and the decrease in the spin polarization of the upper branch of the Rashba-split bands were already reported in the 2D giant Rashba systems Bi/Ag(111) and Pb/Ag(111) and were discussed in detail [35]. 075431- 4GIANT RASHBA SPLITTING OF QUASI-ONE- … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 98, 075431 (2018) FIG. 6.

The contrasts (colors) of each circle represent the spin polarizations along in-plane directions, with the negative values (red) corresponding to the spins parallel to [001].
D. Giant Rashba effect on Bi/InAs(110) The paired parabolic dispersion and the in-plane spin polarizations without breaking time-reversal symmetry, which are perpendicular to both the surface normal and the dispersion direction kx, strongly suggest Rashba-type spin splitting.
The size of the Rashba parameter αR for parabolic bands can be estimated as αR = 2ER/k0 [8], where ER and k0 are the energy and wave-number differences, respectively, between the top of the holelike band and the Kramers degenerate point ( ¯ or ¯Y in the current case; see also Fig. 7).
As shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), the surface bands on Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) can be ﬁt well with a parabola.
From the surface-band dispersion [Figs. 7(a), 7(b) and 2], the Kramers degeneracy points (crossing points) along kx are 0.36 (0.14) eV at ¯ ( ¯Y), and the top of the surface bandsliesat0.07(0.04)eVatkx = ±0.105(0.055) ˚A−1 around FIG.

Note that these kx values can be used for k0 in the equation above.
From these values obtained by ARPES, ER along ¯- ¯X is 0.29 eV, resulting in αR = 5.5 eV ˚A. By the same calculation, (ER, k0) = (0.10 eV, 0.055 ˚A−1) along ¯Y- ¯M; thus, αR = 3.6 eV ˚A. To our knowledge, the maximum value of αR in this system (5.5 eV ˚A) is 4–5 times larger than those of other1DorQ1DRashbasystems[18,19].Evenwhenincluding 2D and 3D systems, the maximum value is greater than those of the typical giant Rashba systems such as Bi/Ag(111) [8], GeTe(111) [11], and BiTeI [12] and is the largest among the Rashba-split states lying around EF, which is an important character to realize spin-dependent transport phenomena.
Only a few surface states far below EF [9,10] have larger αR values than that in the current case.
The fractional contributions of Bi atomic orbitals to the spin-split surface states are listed in Table I.
The main contri- butions to these states are from the 6s and 6p orbitals of the surface Bi atoms.
Owing to the major contribution from 6p, the eigenfunctions of the surface states are quite different from the NFE ones, justifying the giant size of the Rashba effect.
The maximum of the Rashba parameter αR is along ¯- ¯X (5.5 eV ˚A).
Although it is still “giant” along ¯Y- ¯M, the value (3.6 eV ˚A) is smaller than that along ¯- ¯X. This could be due to the slight modiﬁcations of the surface Bi orbitals.
According to a recent theoretical study [28], the size of the spin splitting is proportional to the geometric means between atomic orbitals with the same orbital characters but different magnetic quantum numbers: px, py, and pz in this case.
Mab in Table I indicates a geometric mean of fractional contributions between Bi 6pa and 6pb (a, b = x, y, z).
Since the spin- split states of Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) have sizable fractional contributions from all 6p orbitals, all the geometric means (Mxy, Myz, and Mzx in Table I) have ﬁnite values.
From their sum (see Table I), both Myz and Mzx are suggested to be the scale of the spin splitting; Myz(S1)/Myz(S2) ∼1.2, Mzx(S1)/Mzx(S2) ∼1.4, and αR(S1)/αR(S2) ∼1.5.
These are the geometric means between in-plane and out-of-plane 6p 075431-5TAKUTO NAKAMURA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 98, 075431 (2018) orbitals.
Such hybridizations between in-plane and out-of- plane orbitals have also been observed in other giant Rashba systems [9,10,22,24,26,28,35].
In addition, it should be noted that the nonequivalence between ¯ and ¯Y originates from the 2D, inter-Bi-chain interaction, which suggests that external- ﬁeld application normal to the 1D chain could tune the size of the 1D Rashba effect.
The giant spin splitting in the Q1D surface state discovered hereisexpectedtobeapromisingtemplateforfuturespintronic devices [3].
For example, the efﬁciency of spin-to-charge conversion by the inverse Edelstein effect (IEE), which is scaled by λIEE, is estimated to be ∼4 nm for this state, assuming a momentum relaxation time of 5 fs: this relaxation time is nearly an average of known surface-Rashba systems [13,36,37].
This λIEE value is an order of magnitude larger than those of 2D Rashba systems [13,36] and even larger than those of topological insulators [37], implying that sizable spin-dependent transport in one dimension should be observed on Bi/InAs(110).
In addition, for such applications, a method to control surface carriers is desirable.
Such control would be achieved easily for this surface state because some previous studies actually reported metallic surface states [31].
To tune the surface carrier, carrier accumulation depending on the substrate temperature as discussed in Sec. II as well as surface alloying with smaller-valence elements such as Pb would be applicable.
In addition to industrial applications, the ﬁne tuning of the surface Q1D state with spin splitting is expected to cause exotic electronic phenomena that would be of interest in basic science studies, such as studies on spin-dependent density-wave formation [5] and to realize Majorana bound states [4]. IV.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In summary, we have investigated the Q1D surface states on the Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) surface and its spin-polarized struc- ture by ARPES, spin-resolved ARPES, and DFT calculation.
The surface state showed a nearly metallic character, lying just below the Fermi level EF with giant Rashba spin splitting whose Rashba parameter αR reached ∼5.5 eV ˚A.
This value of the Rashba parameter is 4–5 times larger than that of other 1D or Q1D Rashba systems and is the largest value among all the experimentally realized Rashba-split systems around EF.
The present results are expected to provide a promis- ing foundation for further studies of the exotic electronic phenomena in 1D or Q1D systems with spin-split electronic states as well as for the development of advanced spintronic devices.

ARPES intensity plots at 15 K (hν = 80 eV) with linearly polarized photons, taken from (a) Bi/InAs(110)-(2 × 1) and (b) the as-cleaved pristine InAs(110) surface.
Energy resolutions of these plots were 40 meV. APPENDIX A: SURFACE BAND DISPERSION AND RASHBA SPIN SPLITTING NORMAL TO THE ZIGZAG BI CHAIN Figure 8(a) shows an ARPES intensity plot along ¯- ¯Y, the surface-band dispersion perpendicular to the surface zigzag Bi chain.
It shows a clear periodicity according to the (2 × 1) surface Brillouin zone.
This dispersion between ¯ and ¯Y is derived from ﬁnite 2D interaction across the surface Bi chain.
The overall feature of this dispersion agrees well with the DFT calculation shown in Fig. 6.
The Rashba splitting of the surface band is not resolved along this direction because the splitting is smaller than the peak width of the ARPES energy distribution curves (∼100 meV).
The small size of the Rashba splitting might have resulted from the strong suppression of splitting due to the surface mirror plane along ¯- ¯Y [38].
APPENDIX B: COMPARISON WITH A PRISTINE INAS(110) SURFACE To reveal the role of the (2 × 1) Bi surface atomic structure in the surface electronic states, the band dispersion along ¯- ¯Y from the as-cleaved, pristine (110) surface of InAs is shown in Fig. 8(b).
It shows only bulk holelike bands without any feature below 0.5 eV, indicating that all the electronic structures near EF observed in this work come from the (2 × 1) Bi surface atomic structure.
