Here, we theoretically study the plasmonic properties of such nonsymmorphic nodal-line semimetals.
We show that the nonsymmorphic character endows the plasmons with extremely strong anisotropy.
There exist both intraband and interband plasmon branches.
The intraband branch is gapless and has a q1/2 dispersion.
It is most dispersive and is independent of carrier density in direction normal to the nodal line, whereas along the nodal line, its dispersion is largely suppressed and its frequency scales linearly with carrier density.
The interband branches are gapped and their long-wavelength limits are connected with Van Hove singularities of the band structure.
We ﬁnd that the single-particle excitations are strongly suppressed in such systems, which decreases the Landau damping of plasmons.
These characters are further veriﬁed by ﬁrst-principles calculations on 2D NbSixTe2.
Interesting features in static screening of charged impurity are also discussed.
Our result reveals characteristic plasmons in a class of nonsymmorphic topological semimetals and offers guidance for its experimental detection and possible applications.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.107.115168 I. INTRODUCTION In topological semimetals (TSMs), the Fermi surface con- sists of symmetry-protected band degeneracies, such that the low-energy electronic states can have distinct characters in their energy dispersion, pseudospin structure, and interband coherence [1–4].
This leads to many interesting physical properties, different from conventional metals or doped semi- conductors.
Clearly, the dimensions of the system as well as of the degeneracy manifold play important roles in the physics of TSMs.
For instance, in three-dimensional (3D) materials, stable degeneracy manifolds may take the form of nodal points [5–11], nodal lines [12–15], or nodal surfaces [16–18].
In recent works, the possible protected band degen- eracies were systematically classiﬁed for all magnetic space groups [19–23].
The TSM physics has also been actively explored in two- dimensional (2D) materials [24], which is another research focus in the past two decades [25,26].
In fact, graphene is a prominent example of 2D nodal-point TSMs [27], and studies on graphene drove the whole ﬁeld of topological ma- terials [28].
Meanwhile, there has been a lot of interest in 2D nodal-line semimetals [29,30].
Many candidate materials were proposed [24].
However, most of the proposals suffer one or more of the following drawbacks.
(1) The nodal line *hrchang@mail.ustc.edu.cn is far away from the Fermi level.
(2) Points on the nodal line have a large variation in energy.
(3) There are other extraneous bands coexisting at Fermi energy.
(4) The material is hypo- thetical, or is not stable at ambient condition.
Points (1)–(3) make it difﬁcult to probe signatures of nodal-line states, and point (4) poses a challenge for experimental studies as well as possible applications.
Recently, a series of theoretical and experimental works have established a good TSM state in the NbSixTe2 family of materials [31–36].
These materials were ﬁrst synthesized in the 1990s [37].
In the 3D bulk form, they are van der Waals layered materials, so 2D ultrathin layers can be readily obtained via mechanical exfoliation [38].
It was shown that the bulk material possesses hourglass nodal loops, whereas the 2D monolayer is an almost ideal nodal-line semimetal protected by a nonsymmorphic symmetry [31].
More inter- esting, this family belongs to so-called composition-tunable materials, i.e., there exist a series of stoichiometric members with the formula Nb2n+1SinTe4n+2, or equivalently NbSixTe2 with x = n/(2n + 1) ∈[1/3, 1/2] [37,39–41].
While the spe- ciﬁc band dispersion varies with n, all these members in 2D feature the nonsymmorphic nodal line [34].
It was found that the low-energy bands that make the nodal line are mainly from an array of NbTe2 chains, which can be well cap- tured by a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) -like model [36].
Evidently, the NbSixTe2 family materials offer a promis- ing platform for studying the physics of 2D nodal-line TSMs.
2469-9950/2023/107(11)/115168(10) 115168-1 ©2023 American Physical SocietyCAO, CHANG, FENG, YAO, AND YANG PHYSICAL REVIEW B 107, 115168 (2023) Among various physical properties, plasmons, the collec- tive modes associated with density oscillations of electron liquid, could directly manifest the distinct characters of low- energy electronic states.
Indeed, plasmons of graphene and other TSMs have attracted great interest [42–52].
However, plasmons associated with nodal-line states were mainly stud- ied in 3D systems, and the line is often assumed to have the shape of a perfect ring in Brillouin zone (BZ) [53–55].
This is not the case for the nonsymmorphic nodal line in 2D NbSixTe2, which traverses the BZ along a straight path and exhibits strong anisotropy [34,36].
Thus, it is desirable to ﬁnd out how this nonsymmorphic nodal-line state impacts the plasmon properties.
In this work, we undertake this task and investigate the plasmons of nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
First, by using the 2D SSH-like model, we show that the plasmon spec- trum contains two parts, denoted as intraband and interband plasmons.
The intraband plasmon branch is gapless and has a q1/2 dispersion.
The scaling of plasmon frequency with carrier density n (or Fermi energy) depends on the propaga- tion direction, which crosses over from ∼n0 normal to the nodal line to ∼n along the line.
Meanwhile, the two interband branches are gapped and are connected to the Van Hove sin- gularities of the band structure.
All plasmon branches exhibit strong anisotropy and a characteristic angular dependence.
The single-particle excitations are strongly suppressed in such systems, such that the plasmons may enjoy less damping and longer lifetime.
By using ﬁrst-principles calculations, we show that the key features obtained from the model study can indeed manifest in monolayer NbSixTe2, which distinguish the system from conventional metals and doped semiconduc- tors.
In addition, we show that the screening charge density induced by a charged impurity also exhibits an interest- ing signature owing to the nonsymmorphic nodal line.
Our work reveals characteristic plasmon modes in a class of 2D TSMs and offers guidance for further experimental study on NbSixTe2 family materials. II.
DIRAC SSH MODEL In order to capture the nonsymmorphic nodal line in NbSixTe2 family materials, a minimal lattice model was pro- posed by some of the current authors in Ref. [36].
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce this model and discuss its main features.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the model is deﬁned on a 2D rectangular lattice, with each unit cell containing two sites A and B.
It is more illuminating by viewing the model as consisting of an array of zigzag chains running along the x direction [see Fig. 1(a)].
Physically, each zigzag chain cor- responds to a NbTe2 chain in NbSixTe2 [34].
The crucial symmetries that constrain the system are the glide mirror ˜My = {My| 1 20} and the time-reversal symmetry T .
The glide mirror is a nonsymmorphic symmetry which involves half- lattice translations along the mirror line.
We shall see that these two symmetries determine the existence of the nodal line.
The model can be constructed in two steps.
First, one writes down the Hamiltonian for a single zigzag chain FIG.
1. (a) Schematic diagram of the lattice model.
The unit cell is indicated by the black rectangle.
(b) Brillouin zone (BZ) of the model.
The nodal line at the boundary of BZ is highlighted in red.
(c), (d) Band structure of the model.
Here, energy is in units of t, we set t′ = 0.3t, and kx (ky) is in units of ℓ−1 x (ℓ−1 y ).
labeled by j: H j chain =  i (ta† i,jbi,j + ta† i,jbi−1,j + H.c.), (1) where ai,j and bi,j are the particle operators for A and B sites in a unit cell labeled by the index (i, j).
We suppress spin indices in the model, because the spin-orbit coupling strength in NbSixTe2 is found to be weak [33,34,36].
This one-dimensional model is similar to the famous SSH model [56].
However, in the SSH model, the two t’s in the paren- theses of (1) are typically of different values, allowing for a dimerization pattern.
In comparison, here, the two hopping amplitudes must be equal, as dictated by the ˜My symmetry.
It follows that the spectrum of model (1) must be gapless, with two bands crossing at a Dirac node at the BZ boundary k = π/ℓx, where k is the wave vector along the chain and ℓx is the lattice constant along x.
The second step is to add the interchain coupling to form a 2D model.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the coupling is added between the nearest sites of two neighboring chains, described by Hinter =  i j (t′a† i,j+1bi,j + t′a† i+1,j+1bi,j + H.c.).
(2) Again, the two t′’s in (2) are dictated by ˜My to be equal.
In real materials, the interchain coupling is typically much smaller compared to the intrachain coupling.
This will be assumed in the following discussion.
Combining the two parts gives the whole model H =  j H j chain + Hinter.
(3) It is important to note that adding the interchain coupling does not open a gap in the spectrum.
This feature is solely dictated by symmetry.
Consider the algebraic relation satisﬁed by ˜My: ˜M2 y = T10 = e−ikxℓx, (4) 115168-2PLASMONS IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL NONSYMMORPHIC … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 107, 115168 (2023) where T10 is the unit lattice translation along x (the chain direction).
Since [T , ˜My] = 0 and T 2 = 1 here, we have (T ˜My)2 = e−ikxℓx.
(5) Importantly, each point on the BZ boundary path kx = π/ℓx (X-M) is invariant under the antiunitary symmetry T ˜My, and (T ˜My)2 = −1 there.
Therefore, the bands on the X-M path must be doubly degenerate, and this dictates the presence of a nodal line along this path, as indicated in Fig. 1(b).
In the current model, this nodal line must be formed by the crossing of the two bands.
This also means that the Dirac node we noticed in (1) is not destroyed by the interchain coupling, instead, it extends into a Dirac line at the BZ boundary in the 2D model.
In order to stress this important difference from the conventional SSH model, model (3) was termed as the Dirac SSH model in Ref. [36].
After Fourier transform to momentum space, we have H(k) =t  0 1 + e−ikxℓx 1 + eikxℓx 0  + t′  0 e−ikyℓy(1 + e−ikxℓx ) eikyℓy(1 + eikxℓx ) 0  , (6) where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the intrachain coupling, and the second term corresponds to the interchain coupling.
The model can be easily diagonalized and its spectrum is given by Es(k) = 2s cos kxℓx 2 [t2 + 2tt′ cos(kyℓy) + t′2]1/2, (7) with s = ±1.
The result conﬁrms a nodal line at kx = π/ℓx, where the two bands cross at zero energy.
The band structure of the model is plotted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), from which one can visualize the nodal line at the BZ boundary.
One may expand (7) at a point k∗= (π/ℓx, ky) on the nodal line.
Then, to the linear order in q, i.e., the deviation from k∗, we have Es,k∗(q) ≈−s¯hvF (k∗)qx, (8) where vF (k∗) = ℓx[t2 + 2tt′ cos(kyℓy) + t′2]1/2/¯h (9) is the Fermi velocity along the kx direction at the k∗point.
This conﬁrms the Dirac-type linear band crossing at the nodal line.
In this work, we always assume the model is around half ﬁlling, i.e., the Fermi energy is not far away from the Dirac line.
One can easily calculate the density of states (DOS) D(E) = g  [dk]δ[E −Es(k)] (10) for the Dirac SSH model, where g = 2 is the spin degeneracy, and [dk] ≡ s d2k/(2π)2 is a shorthand notation.
At low energies E, the DOS can be obtained by using Eq. (8) as D(E) = g πt 2 π(1 + ζ ) K  4ζ (1 + ζ )2  ≈ g πt 1 + 1 4ζ 2  .
(11) Here,  = ℓxℓy is the area of a unit cell, ζ = t′/t < 1 is a small number by our assumption, K is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind, and in the second step, we made a series expansion in ζ to the second order.
As a common feature for nodal lines in 2D, the DOS is independent of energy E.
This is similar to the usual 2D electron gas, but is distinct from 2D nodal-point TSMs (like graphene) whose DOS D(E) ∼E [27].
From result (11), the carrier density at low doping is given by n(EF ) = DEF, (12) where EF is the Fermi energy.
Before proceeding, we comment that in 2D systems, be- sides nonsymmorphic symmetry, a nodal line may also be protected by a horizontal symmorphic mirror plane.
For that case, the nodal line typically has the shape of a ring centered around a high-symmetry point in BZ.
In comparison, here the nonsymmorphic nodal line in the Dirac SSH model is enforced to be located on a path at the BZ boundary, and this distinct shape manifests a strong in-plane anisotropy.
In fact, the two different shapes of nodal lines, i.e., a ring around a point or a line traversing BZ, correspond to different topo- logical classes. As shown in Ref.
[57], they are distinguished by the fundamental (homotopy) group of BZ π1(T 2), which describes the winding of a loop around the BZ torus.
Clearly, a nodal ring does not wind around the BZ, whereas the nodal line in Fig. 1(b) winds through the BZ once along the ky direction.
This strong anisotropy of the nodal line in the Dirac SSH model will manifest in the plasmon properties, as we will discuss below. III.
PLASMONS IN DIRAC SSH MODEL Plasmons can be identiﬁed as the zeros of the dynamical dielectric function ε(q, ω) of the system.
Here, we evaluate ε(q, ω) for our 2D Dirac SSH model using the random-phase approximation (RPA), so that ε(q, ω) = 1 −vqχ0(q, ω), (13) where vq = 2πe2 κq is the Fourier component of Coulomb poten- tial in 2D, κ is the background dielectric constant, and χ0 is the single-particle polarization function.
Explicitly, we have χ0(q, ω) = g  ss′  d2k (2π)2 ( fsk −fs′k+q) · F k,k+q ss′ Es(k) −Es′(k + q) + ¯hω + iη, (14) where fsk is the Fermi distribution function for the band eigen- state |usk⟩, F k,k+q ss′ = |⟨usk|us′k+q⟩|2 is the overlap form factor, and η is a small positive number related to the quasiparticle lifetime.
Owing to the band structure of the Dirac SSH model and the constraint from the overlap form factor, we shall see that the contributions in χ0 from s = s′ and from s ̸= s′ give distinct plasmon branches and they are separated in energy.
Therefore, in the following, we shall study them separately.
The former (from s = s′) will be referred to as intraband plasmons, and the latter (from s ̸= s′) will be called interband plasmons.
115168-3CAO, CHANG, FENG, YAO, AND YANG PHYSICAL REVIEW B 107, 115168 (2023) A. Intraband plasmons In this section, we examine the intraband plasmons arising from the contributions with s = s′. Let us ﬁrst consider the limit with t′ →0, where the anal- ysis can be greatly simpliﬁed yet the results already manifest general features of the system.
In this limit, the zigzag chains are totally decoupled.
Physically, in the NbSixTe2 family of materials, this limit corresponds to the case with x →1/2.
It is important to note that for this limit, we have the form factor F k,k+q ss′ = δss′, (15) which means only intraband contribution exists, and the inter- band contribution is totally suppressed.
Then, by substituting Eqs.
(8) and (9) into (14), one can obtain χ0(q, ω) = g vF π ¯hℓy q2 x ω2 −ig qx ¯hℓy δ(ω −vFqx), (16) where vF ≡ℓxt/¯h is the constant Fermi velocity normal to the nodal line in this limit.
The plasmon dispersion is found by substituting (16) into (13) and requesting Reε(q, ω) = 0.
This gives the following intraband plasmon branch: ωq =  2gαs  vF  ℓxq cos θq, (17) where αs = e2/(κ ¯hvF ) is the dimensionless ﬁne-structure constant, q = |q|, and θq is the (in-plane) polar angle for the q vector.
Here, we obtain an anisotropic dispersion ω ∼ qx/√q, because in Eq. (13), although the Coulomb potential (∼1/q) is isotropic, the polarization function in (16) is highly anisotropic and only depends on qx.
There are several notable features of this intraband plas- mon branch.
First, it is gapless with a ω ∼√q dispersion, which is characteristic for 2D systems, such as 2D electron gas and graphene.
Second, the dispersion is independent of the carrier density n (or the Fermi energy).
This behavior is in contrast to other 2D systems, such as 2D electron gas with ω ∼n1/2 and graphene (nodal-point TSM) with ω ∼n1/4 [44].
To understand this behavior, we note that the intra- band plasmon dispersion strongly depends on two factors: the “area” of Fermi surface (which is proportional to DOS) and the band dispersion at Fermi level.
For a 2D nodal-line semimetal and for propagation direction normal to the line, both factors are independent of Fermi energy (hence the carrier density), so that ω does not depend on n. Third, as we discussed, the nonsymmorphic nodal line here exhibits a strong anisotropy.
This manifests in the dispersion through the cos θq dependence, so that the dispersion is largest in the x direction and is suppressed in the y direction.
Finally, due to the αs factor, the frequency explicitly involves the Planck con- stant ¯h.
This is in contrast to ordinary electron liquids where the long-wavelength plasma frequency is classical (does not involve ¯h) [58]. As noted in Ref.
[44], this feature indicates the quantum character of Dirac-type fermions.
The damping and lifetime of plasmons are closely related to the single-particle excitation (SPE) continuum, which can be derived from the imaginary part of the polarization func- tion.
From Eq. (16), we see that in the limit of decoupled chains, SPE occurs only on the line ω = vFqx in the (q, ω) parameter space.
This is in sharp contrast to other 2D sys- tems (such as 2D electron gas and graphene) where the SPE always covers an extended region [42,58].
It follows that the plasmons in the Dirac SSH system can be hardly damped by SPEs and should have a long lifetime.
This feature could be beneﬁcial for possible plasmon-based applications.
Next, we add the interchain coupling t′ and investigate its effects on the intraband plasmons.
Again, please note that we assume ζ = t′/t is small.
In this case, the overlap form factor becomes F k,k+q ss′ = δss′ −1 4ss′ζ 2q2 y cos2(kyℓy), (18) where higher order correction terms of O(ζ 4) are ignored.
One observes that the second term in (18) gives a correction for the intraband contribution.
Meanwhile, it also makes the interband contribution nonzero, which we shall discuss in the next section.
Substituting (18) into (14) and considering the long- wavelength limit with q ≪kF ≡EF/(¯hvF ), we ﬁnd that for the intraband term Im χintra 0 ≈2πgω  FS [dk] v−1 sk F k,k+q ss ×δ[Es(k) −Es(k + q) + ¯hω], (19) where the integration is performed on the Fermi surface, and vsk = ∇kEs(k)/¯h is the group velocity of state |usk⟩.
From this expression, the intraband SPE continuum can be derived as ¯hω = xqx + yqy, (20) where x and y are functions of k, given by x = ℓxt cos 	kxℓx 2 [1 + ζ cos(kyℓy)], (21) y = −2ℓyt′ sin 	kxℓx 2  sin(kyℓy).
(22) It follows that the SPE continuum evolves from a line in t′ = 0 limit to a fan-shaped region for t′ ̸= 0 in the (q, ω) space, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The real part of χintra 0 can be obtained as Reχintra 0 ≈g vF π ¯hℓy 1 ω2  q2 x −1 4ζ 2 q2 x −2k2 Fℓ2 yq2 y  .
(23) Then, the dispersion of long-wavelength intraband plasmons in the presence of interchain coupling is ωq =  2gαs  vF  ℓxq 	 1 −1 4ζ 2  cos2 θq + 1 2ζ 2k2 Fℓ2 y sin2 θq 1/2 .
(24) One can see that the interchain coupling (nonzero ζ) gives a correction to the dispersion.
In the limit of ζ →0, this expres- sion reduces to Eq. (17), as expected.
The previously noted features, including the √q dependence, the strong anisotropy, and the quantum character (involving ¯h explicitly) are main- tained after including the interchain coupling.
The strongest dispersion of these plasmons is still along the x direction, i.e., 115168-4PLASMONS IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL NONSYMMORPHIC … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 107, 115168 (2023) FIG. 2.

the direction normal to the nodal line.
Along this direction, θq = 0 and we have ωq =  2gαs  	 1 −1 4ζ 2  vF  ℓxq, (25) which is still independent of the carrier density n.
The inter- chain coupling only gives a small correction to the frequency.
Meanwhile, for plasmons propagating along the direction of the nodal line, i.e., θq = π/2, we have ωq = √gαsζvFkF  ℓyq.
(26) Therefore, with the interchain coupling, the intraband plas- mons in this direction acquire ﬁnite frequency.
Moreover, due to the kF factor, the plasmon frequency scales linearly with n (or EF).
In other words, at ﬁnite interchain coupling, there is a crossover in the scaling of intraband plasmon frequency from ω ∼n0 to ω ∼n, when θq varies from 0 to π/2.
Such a crossover behavior clearly reﬂects the strong anisotropy of the nonsymmorphic nodal line.
These features are veriﬁed by our numerical calculations on the Dirac SSH model.
In the calculation, the plasmon modes are extracted from the peaks of the energy loss function L(q, ω) = Im  − 1 ε(q, ω)  .
(27) As shown in Fig. 2(a), the result from the numerical calcu- lation agrees very well with the analytic formula (24).
The plasmons are quite separated from the SPE continuum which only spans a small region.
In Fig. 2(b), we plot the frequency versus q1/2, so that one can clearly see the ω ∼q1/2 disper- sion.
Figure 2(c) shows the angular dependence of plasma frequency at a ﬁxed wave vector magnitude.
The frequency is maximum at direction normal to the nodal line and is mini- mum along the nodal line, reﬂecting the strong anisotropy of the system.
Finally, in Fig. 2(d), we plot ω as a function of EF for different propagation directions, which conﬁrms the scaling behavior discussed above.
We comment that strongly anisotropic plasmons were also studied before in other systems, such as TTF-TCNQ [59,60].
However, TTF-TCNQ is a 3D material and its low-energy bands are of conventional quadratic dispersion.
These factors result in gapped intraband plasmon branches, conventional frequency scaling behavior, and extended SPE regions, which are distinct from our system.
B. Interband plasmons From the overlap form factor in (18), we notice that along the x direction, only intraband plasmons exist.
However, for other directions, especially the y direction, interband contri- butions with s ̸= s′ can exist when there is nonzero interchain coupling t′. For these interband modes, χ0 may involve virtual transitions between states away from the nodal line, so it is dif- ﬁcult to get simple analytic results.
In the following, we shall proceed with numerical calculation of the Dirac SSH model.
Figure 3(a) shows the obtained energy loss function for q along the nodal-line (y) direction, where such interband plasmons are most pronounced.
One observes that besides the gapless intraband branch at low frequencies, there are two other gapped branches at much higher frequencies.
They correspond to the interband plasmons.
As we mentioned, these interband modes are related to interband virtual transitions in the band structure.
Actually, one can see that the long-wavelength limit of the two branches encode the information of the Van Hove singularities of the Dirac SSH band structure.
As indicated in Fig. 3(b), in the q →0 limit, the virtual transitions are vertical, and there are two dominant frequencies ω1 and ω2 corresponding to the Van Hove singularities at Y and  of BZ.
It is more convenient to visualize these two frequencies as corresponding to the singularities in the joint density of states (JDOS), as shown in Fig. 3(c).
In the plasmon spectrum, ω1 and ω2 are exactly the limiting values of the two interband branches in the q →0 limit.
(Here, the intensity of the peak vanishes, because the form factor is zero in this limit.) With increasing q, the fre- quency of the upper branch decreases and the lower branch increases, and the two merge at q = π/ℓy, corresponding to the interband transitions from  to Y or from Y to , owing to the particle-hole symmetry of the model.
Such connection between interband plasmons and singularities in JDOS is generic and is observed also in many other systems, e.g., in a recent study on twisted double bilayer graphene [61].
Another feature to be noted is that the band width of these two interband branches is on the order of interchain coupling t′.
This can be easily understood by noting that this width scales with the electronic band energy variation along ky, which is governed by t′. In Fig. 3(d), we plot the plasmon spectrum at a decreased value of t′ as compared to Fig. 3(a).

MATERIAL RESULT We have studied the plasmonic properties of the 2D Dirac SSH model.
In this section, we shall see whether these properties can manifest in the real material system, i.e., the monolayer NbSixTe2 family of materials.
Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the crystal structure of Nb3SiTe6 (i.e., x = 1/3).
The structure consists of three atomic layers.
The Nb and Si atoms form the middle layer, which is sandwiched by two layers of Te atoms.
Within the 2D plane, the structure can be viewed as constructed by three basic building blocks, which are conventionally named as a, b, and c chains, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a).
a and b chains contain Si atoms, and they share the same composition of NbSi1/2Te2.
In comparison, the c chain does not contain Si, so it has a composition of NbTe2.
a and b chains are connected by the glide mirror symmetry ˜My, and they always stick together.
In terms of these building blocks, Nb3SiTe6 in Fig. 4(c) has the conﬁguration of (ab)1c.
Other members of the NbSixTe2 family are obtained by repeating more (ab) chain units be- tween the c chains, so they have the general conﬁguration of (ab)nc [34], as shown in Fig. 4(d).
In this picture, their general chemical formula may also be written as (Nb2SiTe4)n(NbTe2).
We perform ﬁrst-principles calculations on the three mem- ber materials with n = 1, 2, 3.
The calculation method is given in the Appendix.
Previous works showed that the spin- orbit coupling is weak in these materials [33,34,36], so it is neglected in our calculation.
The obtained band structures are plotted in Fig. 5, which agree with previous results [34]. One FIG.

observes that the three band structures share similar features, with a nonsymmorphic nodal line close to the Fermi level on the X-M path, formed by the crossing of two bands.
Previous studies showed that the low-energy states are mainly from the c chains [34,35].
The intrachain coupling is strong, making a sizable dispersion along the x direction (along the chain).
The interchain coupling is relatively weak and it naturally decreases with increasing n. Based on the ﬁrst-principles band structures, we compute their plasmon spectra in RPA. First, FIG.

consider the plasmon dispersion along x, i.e., the direction normal to the nodal line.
The results are plotted (versus q1/2) in Fig. 6.
One can see that there is a single gapless branch with ω ∼q1/2 in this direction, representing the in- traband plasmons, consistent with our model result in Fig. 2.
The plasmon peaks in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f) are quite sharp, indicating their weak Landau damping and long lifetime.
In- deed, our calculation shows that the SPE continuum for n = 2 or 3 is far separated from the plasmon branch.
In comparison, the plasmon peaks for n = 1 are smeared out for ¯hω above 50 meV [Fig. 6(d)].
This is due to the overlap with the SPE region [see Fig. 6(a)].
The SPE continuum for n = 1 spans a much larger region, because the material’s band structure has a stronger deviation from the Dirac SSH model, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 5(b).
In Fig. 7(a), we show the variation of the intraband plas- mon frequency with Fermi energy.
One observes that at a ﬁxed wave vector qx, the frequencies are almost independent of EF, which conﬁrms the scaling behavior we ﬁnd in the model study.
In Fig. 7(b) , we plot the angular dependence of intraband plasmons, showing a behavior consistent with the model result in Fig. 2(c).
It conﬁrms that the dispersion is strongest along x (i.e., normal to the nodal line) and is suppressed along y (parallel to the nodal line).
Next, we plot the energy loss spectra along the y direction in Fig. 7(c).
One observes the presence of interband plasmon branches at higher frequencies.
This agrees with the model result.
Nevertheless, there appear to be more than two in- terband branches, especially for n = 2 and 3.
This is due to the presence of other nearby bands in Fig. 5, which also contribute to the interband transitions.
Consistent with our model analysis, one can see that the width of the interband branches decreases with n. For n = 2 and 3, these branches become very ﬂat, again reﬂecting the weak interchain coupling.
In addition, one also observes in Fig. 7(c) that the intra- band plasmon branch is strongly suppressed with increasing n, which almost entirely disappears for the n = 3 case.
This again indicates that the interchain coupling is already very small for n = 2 and 3, so the Dirac bands become almost dis- persionless along the nodal line, which suppresses intraband plasmons in this direction.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We have discussed the distinct features of plasmons in the class of nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
The example materials used in our study, namely, the NbSixTe2 family materials, already exist.
Their high-quality 2D ultrathin layers have been demonstrated in experiment [38].
In addition, there exist several other isostructural materials, including TaSixTe2, NbGexTe2, and TaGexTe2, with the similar nodal-line band structure [31,40,41].
We expect our theory can be readily tested in these materials.
As for probing the plasmon excitations, there are several established experimental techniques, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [62,63], inelastic helium atom scat- tering, and transmission electron microscopy.
Particularly, the FIG.

Screening charge density δn(r) induced by a charge im- purity at the origin.
(a) ζ = 0 and (b) ζ = 0.3.
Here, x and y are plotted in units of ℓx and ℓy.
The model parameters are the same as in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) and we take EF = 50 meV. high-resolution EELS provides a powerful tool for mapping out the plasmon spectrum.
It was demonstrated that the tech- nique can reach a resolution of a few meV and the detected frequency range can reach ∼1 eV [63,64].
Hence, our pre- dicted features in 2D NbSixTe2 should be easily detectable in experiment.
In addition, we mention that besides plasmons, the unusual dielectric function for nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs may also manifest in the screening charge distribution induced by a charge impurity.
Consider a charge impurity next in a 2D system.
Its induced screening charge density δn can be expressed as δn(r) =  dq (2π)2  1 ε(q, 0) −1  next(q)eiq·r.
(28) For usual 2D electron gas, the induced charge density δn exhibits the well-known Friedel oscillation, with δn(r) ∼ cos(2kFr)/r2.
The oscillation wave vector 2kF arises from the singularity in the static dielectric function ε(q, 0).
Now, consider the Dirac SSH model.
For the t′ →0 limit, the Fermi surface (at EF ̸= 0) are given by two straight lines parallel to the nodal line.
From Eq. (15), singularities in ε(q, 0) arise only from the nesting vector restricted to each piece of the Fermi surface.
Importantly, the special Fermi surface here gives not one but a continuum of nesting wave vectors qˆy along the y direction.
After Fourier transform to real space, the induced charge density should exhibit peaks on a straight line along x through the charge impurity, as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Increasing t′ to a nonzero but small value, we ﬁnd that the distribution of singular wave vectors evolve from a single line to two lines forming a cross at q = 0.
Accordingly, the screening charge density peaks also transform from the horizontal line in Fig. 8(a) to two almost straight lines through the charge impurity as in Fig. 8(b).
In conclusion, we discover interesting plasmon properties in a class of 2D nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
Using the Dirac SSH model, we show that the system possesses two kinds of plasmons: the gapless intraband plasmons and the gapped interband plasmons.
The intraband plasmons have a q1/2 dependence.
The dispersion and the carrier density scaling are highly anisotropic.
Normal to the nodal line, the dispersion is strongest and is independent of carrier density; whereas along the nodal line, the dispersion is largely sup- pressed and is linear in the carrier density.
The interband plasmons have a quite ﬂat dispersion, with band width scaling with the interchain coupling.
Their long-wavelength limits are connected with transitions between Van Hove singularities of the band structure.
Most these plasmons are separated from the SPE continuum, so they should have a weak Landau damp- ing.
The revealed features are also veriﬁed in the NbSixTe2 family of materials via ﬁrst-principles calculations.
Our work reveals physical consequences of a topological state of matter.
The predicted physics will also motivate further studies on 2D nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs and on the NbSixTe2 family of materials.

APPENDIX: CALCULATION METHOD The electronic structures of the NbSixTe2 were calculated based on the density functional theory using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [65–67].
The ionic potentials were treated with the projector augmented-wave pseudopo- tentials [68], with 4p65s14d4, 3s23p2, and 5s25p4 valence electron conﬁgurations for Nb, Si, and Te atoms, respec- tively.
The exchange-correlation energy was treated with the generalized-gradient approximation [69] in the scheme of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [70] approach.
The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to be 400 eV and the convergence thresholds for energy and force were chosen to be 10−7 eV and 0.001 eV/ ˚A, respectively.
-centered k-point meshes with size 10 × 6 × 1 for (ab)1c and 10 × 4 × 1 for (ab)2c and (ab)3c were used for BZ sampling.
After obtaining the band structure, ab initio tight-binding models were constructed by using the WANNIER90 package [71].
The p orbitals of Te atoms and the d orbitals of Nb atoms were used as the initial input of local basis.
The Wannier model was used to calculate the dynamical dielectric function in RPA.
