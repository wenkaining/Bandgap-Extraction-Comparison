In the low temperature (T < Tcoh  40 K) Fermi liquid state, however, a new peak in the scattering occurs at E2  33 meV, which lies in the hybridization gap that exists in this compound.
We report inelastic neutron scattering results for a single-crystal sample.
The scattering at energies near E1 qualitatively has the momentum (Q) dependence expected for interband scattering across the indirect gap.
The scattering near E2 has a very different Q dependence: it is a weak function of Q over a large fraction of the Brillouin zone and is smallest near 1=2; 1=2; 1=2. A possibility is that the peak at E2 arises from a spatially localized excitation in the hybridization gap.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.117206 PACS numbers: 75.20.Hr, 61.12.Ex, 71.28.+d The Anderson lattice [1,2], in which a small (10–30 meV) gap in the electronic structure arises from hybridization of the 4f electrons with the conduction electrons [Fig. 1(f)], is believed to capture the essence of the physics of intermediate valence (IV) compounds.
When the Fermi level is in the gap, the behavior is that of the Kondo insulators such as YbB12 and SmB6.
The most direct experimental evidence for the gap comes from measurements of the optical conductivity.
For example, for YbB12 the low temperature conductivity vanishes below 25 meV, and then rises to a maximum in the mid-IR near 0.25 eV [3].
The experimental neutron scattering spectra of the Kondo insulators also show low temperature features whose energy scale is that of the gap.
The intensity of these features is highly Q dependent, being smallest at the zone center and peaking at the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 zone-boundary point in YbB12 [4] and SmB6 [5].
When the Fermi level is not in the gap, the behavior is that of an intermediate valence metal.
The cubic (Cu3Au structure) compound YbAl3 exhibits strong intermediate valence (z  2:75) and a large Kondo temperature (TK  600–700 K).
Below the ‘‘coherence temperature’’ Tcoh  40 K, where the resistivity exhibits the T2 behavior ex- pected for a Fermi liquid [6], the optical conductivity exhibits [7] a narrow Drude resonance separated by a deep minimum at 30 meV from a mid-IR peak at 0.25 eV. It is believed that the minimum and the mid-IR peak arise from the (vertical) interband transitions across the hybridization gap, while the Drude resonance arises from intraband transitions across the Fermi level, which lies in a region of high density of states near the zone boundary.
Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments [8] in polycrystalline samples of YbAl3 have shown that for T > 40 K the magnetic scattering is broad with a characteristic energy of order E1  50 meV, correspond- ing to the Kondo temperature, but at low temperature an additional narrow peak occurs in the INS near E2  33 meV.
This is the same energy as the minimum in the optical conductivity; i.e., it occurs on the same scale as the hybridization gap.
This peak broadens and weakens on alloying with a small concentration of Lu [9], which fact, taken together with the disappearance of the peak above 40 K, means it is a property of the fully coherent ground state.
To explore the physics of this scattering, and, in particu- lar, to determine the Q dependence, we have performed inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crys- tals of YbAl3.
The crystals were grown by precipitation from excess aluminum (self-ﬂux method).
Experiments were performed at 6 and 100 K on the MAPS time-of- ﬂight spectrometer at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
The initial energy was ﬁxed at Ei  60 and 120 meV. Four crystals, of total mass 5 g, were mounted on an aluminum sample holder and coaligned with a mosaic of 2.5.
We set ki (the incoming beam wave vector) initially parallel to the 1; 0; 0 direction; in a second set of measurements we chose ki k 1; 1; 0.
Unlike the case of a triple-axis spec- trometer where the crystal is rotated to construct a scan over energy transfer with Q  2=a0 (h; k; l) held con- stant, for MAPS, where the crystal orientation is ﬁxed during the scan, only three of the four variables h, k, l, and E are independent in any plot at ﬁxed Ei.
The scattering was normalized to a vanadium standard and is given in absolute units in Figs. 1–3.
In Fig. 1 we plot the scattering at T  6 K as a function of energy transfer at different momentum transfers.
In agreement with the earlier results reported for polycrystals PRL 96, 117206 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 24 MARCH 2006 0031-9007=06=96(11)=117206(4)$23.00 117206-1 © 2006 The American Physical Society[8,9], the scattering shows two features: a peak centered at E2  33 meV, whose width is essentially equal to the instrumental resolution, and a broad feature centered at E1  50 meV.
In Figs. 1(a)–1(d) where ki k 110, both h and k vary with h 	 k constant, as E varies; in Fig. 1(e) where ki k 100, only h varies with E. The values of h; k; l given in the ﬁgure correspond to the values at E1 and E2.
Since YbAl3 has the Cu3Au crystal structure (with a0  4:203 A), the Brillouin zone (BZ) is a simple cube centered at  and extending  0:5 in reduced (h; k; l) units in all three directions.
Hence, Fig. 1 shows the E2 peak at key positions in the BZ, including the  point [Fig. 1(a)], various zone-boundary points [Figs. 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e)], and a point in the middle of the BZ [Fig. 1(c)].
Plots at other positions in the BZ are very similar.
The variation in the position and the magnitude of the E2 peak is small.
Hence, while the scattering near E1 shows considerable variation of intensity and line shape with Q, the peak at E2 appears to be essentially independent of Q. Figure 2(a) shows for ki k 100 an intensity map for the projection onto the k-l plane for an interval of energy transfer E1   5 meV.
In this plot, the reduced wave vector h varies with k and l; contours of constant h are exhibited in the plot.
The cubic symmetry is readily apparent.
Peaks are observed near h; 0:5; 0:5, where hE  E1  1:3.
These peaks lie essentially at the zone edge not far from the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 point.
Figure 2(b) shows for ki k 100 an intensity plot in the E  Qk plane for 0:2 < l < 0:2.
The scattering is basically independent of k for E  E2; this path traverses the zone center at 1; 1; 0 and the zone boundary at 0:8; 0:5; 0. Figure 2 conﬁrms our observation that the scattering near E1 is highly Q dependent, peaking at the zone boundary, while the scattering near E2 is independent of Q.
The total scattering for E > 20 meV decreases with temperature [Fig. 1(a)] and with total Q in the extended zone for 0:4 < l < 2:6 (not shown here).
Hence it cannot FIG.

It does, however, overlap with phonon scattering.
To estimate the nonmagnetic scat- tering we ﬁt the Ei  60 meV data at 100 K to the sum of a q-independent Lorentzian representing the magnetic scat- tering and three phonon peaks near 12.5, 22, and 30 meV. The best ﬁt gave Lorentzian parameters (E0  20 meV and   40 meV) similar to those of Ref. [8].
We sub- tracted the Lorentzian from the scattering to obtain the nonmagnetic scattering at 100 K, scaled the latter to 7 K by the ratio of the thermal (Bose) factors, and subtracted it off to obtain the magnetic scattering at 7 K. Details are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 3(a).
The nonmagnetic scattering is quite small for Ei  60 meV; it is larger for Ei  120 meV due to multiple scattering, but remains smaller than the mag- netic contribution.
We also measured the spectra on the HB3 triple-axis spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Six ﬂux-grown crystals, each approximately 1 g, were coaligned to within  0:3 with the 1; 1; 0 direction vertical.
We measured the spectra at 10 and 100 K, using a ﬁxed ﬁnal energy of 14.7 meVand a collimation 300-400-800-2400.
The counting rate is normalized to monitor count units (1 mcu  1 s).
For each value of Q1  2=a0 (h; k; l) we measured the 10 K spectra at a second momentum transfer Q2  2=a0 (h; k; l 	 2) that is equivalent to Q1 in the reduced zone scheme and has a similar structure factor, and then ﬁt the data as the sum of a magnetic contribution ME that varies with Q as the 4f form factor and a phonon contri- bution PhE that scales as Q2.
In Fig. 4(b) it can be seen that at low Q the phonon contribution (solid line) is small compared to the magnetic scattering (open circles), as expected.
For comparison we show (solid circles) the magnetic scattering determined using the same method as for the MAPS data.
The magnetic scattering obtained by each method is similar, and is similar to that seen in the MAPS data.
In Fig. 4 the 4f form factor has been divided out in order to represent the scattering in the reduced zone.
The scat- tering is essentially identical at the zone center, and at the 0; 0; 1=2 and 1=2; 1=2; 0 zone-boundary points.
This conﬁrms our time-of-ﬂight result that the 30 meV scatter- ing is largely Q independent.
We note, however, that the scattering at the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 zone-boundary point is considerably weaker.
This effect can also be seen in the time-of-ﬂight data in Fig. 3(c) and to a lesser extent in Fig. 1(d).
Our basic result, then, is that the scattering near E1  50 meV is highly Q dependent, with peaks at the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 zone boundary, but apart from the variation with the 4f form factor, the scattering near E2  33 meV appears to be only weakly dependent on Q, being strongest FIG. 3.

The data have been divided by the 4f form factor, and thus represent the scattering in the reduced zone.
The magnetic scattering was determined by subtracting phonons determined (1) at 10 K by Q2 scaling (open circles) and (2) at 100 K by assuming a Lorentzian for the magnetic scattering (solid circles).
An example of the phonons is given in (b) as a solid line.

In calculations [1,2] of the interband transitions in the renormalized band structure [Fig. 1(f)] of the Anderson lattice, the scattering is highly Q dependent.
The most intense scattering occurs when the energy transfer E equals the threshold for indirect transitions between the regions of large density of states at the zone center and the zone boundary of the upper and lower bands, respectively.
This occurs when Q  qBZ [Fig. 1(f)].
At smaller Q, the scattering is weaker and occurs at higher energy.
When the Fermi level does not lie in the gap, so that the behavior is that of an IV metal, the interband transitions still occur and show a very similar Q dependence to that of the Kondo insulators (see Fig. 5 of Ref. [1]).
In addition, low energy intraband scattering across the Fermi surface is expected; this is related to the Drude scattering in the optical con- ductivity.
The characteristic energy for such scattering varies linearly with Q, as expected on general grounds for a Fermi liquid.
In YbAl3 the scattering near E1  50 meV shows con- siderable Q dependence and peaks near the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 zone-boundary point, consistent with interband scattering across an indirect gap of order 50 meV.
We note that this is also the Kondo scale for this compound; if so, the high temperature Kondo scattering evolves into interband scat- tering with the same energy scale.
Sharp excitations at low temperatures, whose energy scale is that of the hybridization gap, have been observed at low temperatures in the Kondo insulators SmB6 [5], YbB12 [4], and TmSe [10].
These excitations are highly Q dependent.
For example, in TmSe the intensity is at least a factor of 4 smaller at zone center than at the zone boundary, and in YbB12 and SmB6 the intensity is largest at the zone boundary along the 1; 1; 1 direction, decreas- ing dramatically as Q increases or as the angle of Q with respect to the 1; 1; 1 direction changes.
Such scattering thus has the behavior expected for threshold scattering at the zone boundary.
By contrast, the sharp E2 peak in YbAl3 shows little variation in intensity for different values of Q that include the zone center, key zone-boundary points, and points in the center of the reduced zone (Figs. 1 and 4); and in addition the scattering is weaker at the 1=2; 1=2; 1=2 point [Figs. 3(c) and 4(d)].
Hence the Q dependence of this excitation is opposite to what is seen in the Kondo insulators.
It clearly does not have the Q dependence expected for threshold interband scattering, unless the actual renormalized band structure is very different from that shown in Fig. 1(f).
This excitation occurs at too large an energy, and lacks the expected Q dependence, to arise from intraband Fermi surface scattering.
Since the ampli- tude of this peak is strongly diminished at 100 K, it cannot represent a crystal ﬁeld transition; and, indeed, well- deﬁned crystal ﬁeld excitations are not expected in inter- mediate valence systems with such large Kondo tempera- tures.
The magnetic scattering at E2 may arise from coupling to the optic phonon which is seen at nearly the same energy.
An important possibility is that the scattering represents a spatially localized excitation.
The energy of the excita- tion coincides with the deep minimum in the optical con- ductivity; this suggests that the localized excitation lies inside the hybridization gap, having the character of an exciton.
Riseborough [11] showed that a magnetic bound state, whose energy lies below the interband threshold, can arise in the Kondo insulators due to RKKY interactions.
Such a bound state, however, should be large for zone- boundary Q, dispersing and losing amplitude rapidly as Q decreases.
Brandow [2] postulated the existence of a local- ized on-site valence ﬂuctuation from the hybridized state into the unhybridized trivalent (4f13) state.
He showed that when such an elementary excitation, which unbinds or unscreens a local moment, is included in a consistent manner with the usual excited states of the Anderson lattice, a two-peak structure of the susceptibility and spe- ciﬁc heat should occur, similar to the low temperature anomalies observed [6] experimentally in YbAl3.
In his treatment, however, the excitation was not derived from the Anderson lattice Hamiltonian but was included in an ad hoc manner.
It is thus an open question of whether and how such an excitation can arise in the context of the Anderson lattice.
It is also unclear why a local excitation should be so sensitive to alloy disorder [9].
We are grateful to Steve Shapiro for sharing and discus- sing his unpublished data on this compound, and to Peter Riseborough and Steve Nagler for helpful discussions.
