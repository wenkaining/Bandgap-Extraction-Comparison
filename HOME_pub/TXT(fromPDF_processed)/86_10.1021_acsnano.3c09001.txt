Helicity-resolved steady-state photoluminescence (PL) reveals no optical degree of polarization.
Time-resolved PL shows a photocarrier lifetime on the order of nanoseconds.
From simultaneously recorded time-resolved differential reflectivity (TRΔR) and time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE), a photocarrier lifetime of a few nanoseconds and a spin relaxation time on the order of picoseconds was found.
This stark contrast in lifetimes clearly explains the lack of spin polarization in steady-state PL.
While we observe clear temperature-dependent effects on the PL dynamics that can be related to structural dynamics, spin relaxation is nearly T-independent.
Our results highlight that spin relaxation in 2D (BA)(MA)PbI occurs at time scales faster than the exciton recombination time, which poses a bottleneck for applications aiming to utilize this degree of freedom.
KEYWORDS: layered perovskites, (BA)(MA)PbI, spin dynamics, photocarrier dynamics, time-resolved spectroscopy T he perovskite CaTiO3 was discovered in 1839 by Gustav Rose, fortuitously starting a debate lasting over a hundred years about the general crystal structure of perovskites.1,2 Since then, perovskites have been a topic of intense research for a multitude of features, from high- temperature superconductivity,3−5 giant magnetoresistance,6 and oxide fuel cells7 to efficient solar cells.8,9 Especially, they have been shown to host exceptionally high quantum efficiency in terms of their optoelectronic performance.10−12 This combined with the presence of spin−orbit interaction, particuarly strong in lead halide based perovskites, and a resulting broken spin degeneracy makes them highly appealing for spin-optoelectronic devices.13−16 However, an indisputable challenge to their application is the (photo)degradation of perovskites resulting in a notably short device lifetime.17 In recent years, layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have emerged as a viable alternative, as several groups have reported an increase in lifetime of 2D perovskite devices.18−20 Being two-dimensional by design, it is relatively straightforward to exploit quantum confinement effects to tune their band gap by adjustment of the layer number, making them perfectly suited for multijunction devices.21 In that way the efficiency limit of a single junction can be overcome .22,23 One example of such a layered perovskite is butylamonium methylamonium lead iodide, (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.
Its band gap can be tailored from 1.5 to 2.3 eV by reducing the layer number from bulk to a stack of single layers, thereby covering almost the whole visible spectral range.17,23,24 Given their recent emergence, funda- mental properties of the layered perovskite materials have not been fully explored, particularly in the direction of their spin and carrier dynamics,25 vital aspects to be explored for practical applications.
With a change of dimensionality from 3D to 2D, there is a potential for breaking inversion symmetry in the out- of-plane direction at the interfaces of layered perovskites, which leads to Rashba-like spin−orbit coupling that in turn impacts spin dynamics,13,26−28 motivating intense research.
From that perspective, through transient spectroscopy the coupling of polaronic states and excitons,29 spin-selective Received: September 19, 2023 Revised: December 7, 2023 Accepted: December 11, 2023 Published: December 14, 2023 Article www.acsnano.org © 2023 American Chemical Society 25459 https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.3c09001 ACS Nano 2023, 17, 25459−25467 Downloaded via SHANGHAI UNIV on June 17, 2025 at 14:27:24 (UTC).

Thus, it is necessary to study the individual material configuration over a wide temperature range, ideally using multiple spectroscopy techniques to determine the dynamics.
In this paper, we use the combination of TRPL, HRPL, time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE) and time-resolved differential reflectivity (TRΔR) to study spin relaxation and photocarrier lifetimes in (BA)(MA)PbI with a layer number of 4 (n = 4) over a temperature range from a few kelvin to ambient conditions.
We find significant changes in the PL dynamics with temperature, indicating a strong influence of exciton−phonon interaction and hinting at a crystallographic phase change at around 140 K. By contrast, spin relaxation occurs on significantly shorter, few-picosecond timescales and only slightly decreases throughout the whole temperature range.
Consequently, steady-state HRPL shows no discernible spin contrast.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Transmission and PL of Layered (BA)(MA)PbI. In this work, we use few-layer (BA)(MA)PbI encapsulated top and bottom in thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers, which serve to protect the perovskite from deterioration under ambient conditions.38 The left panel of Figure 1a shows an optical microscope image of a typical sample, where the (BA)(MA)PbI layer appears in brown and the top and bottom hBN layers appear in light blue.
At first glance, the perovskite exhibits the thickness of a bulk crystal, but a spacer every few layers (for n = 4 every fourth) separates the bulk, in the out-of- plane direction, into individual 2D perovskite layers, giving the crystal its distinctive layered character (sketched on the right- hand side of Figure 1a).
The high resolution false-color maps in Figure 1b−d show a low-temperature (T = 6 K) photoluminescence (PL) measure- ment from the region marked by the black square in Figure 1a.
The intensity (Figure 1b), center position (Figure 1c), and full width at half-maximum (Figure 1d) are extracted from a Gaussian fit around the exciton peak.
While the intensity map shows some variation, the exciton center position and full width at half-maximum are extraordinarily uniform, indicating high sample quality.
White-light transmission spectroscopy at 4 K, shown in Figure 1e, reveals a prominent transmission dip at ∼1.9 eV, associated with the ground-state exciton of the n = 4 (BA)(MA)PbI.18,21,39,40 The single-particle band gap of 2.08 eV, extracted by Blancon et al. from fitting an excitonic Rydberg series with a modified 2D hydrogen model,21 is marked for reference, showing the large exciton binding energy of ∼200 meV. Due to spin-dependent selection rules for optical excitation and recombination,37 it is possible to couple pseudospin values with involved emitting states.32,41 The most simple exper- imental pieces of evidence for this are so-called optical orientation42 measurements.
These are helicity-resolved PL experiments where a circularly polarized laser is used for Table 1.

The degree of polarization P can be defined as = + P I I I I (Co) (Contra) (Co) (Contra) (1) where I(Co) and I(Contra) are the PL intensities correspond- ing to co- and cross-polarized detection helicity configurations with respect to excitation, respectively.
Spectra recorded at a nominal sample temperature of 6 K and excitation energy of 2.33 eV, with co- and cross-circular configurations, are shown in Figure 1f.
For these traces, we have combined four measurement configurations, i.e. the cocircular helicities of excitation and detection (σ+/σ+ and σ−/σ−) and the cross- circular helicities (σ+/σ−and σ−/σ+) to suppress any setup- related artifacts.
Evidently, the PL emission does not portray any measurable degree of polarization.
In order to explain this loss of polarization, we turn to time-resolved spectroscopy.
Figure 2a shows a series of TRPL traces at various temperatures from 6 to 260 K, obtained by exciting the sample with a laser energy of 3.06 eV and a 50 ps pulse train (repetition rate 10 MHz, average power 10 nW).
The PL from the sample is directed through a long-pass filter with 450 nm onset wavelength to suppress the excitation laser and detected with an avalanche photodiode.
The individual traces are fitted with a biexponential function, from which we extract the fit parameters for amplitude (A1,2) and decay time (τ1,2), respectively (see Figure 2b).
At low temperatures, the dynamics is dominated by the fast component of the decay (τ1 ≈0.35 ns), while the slow component (τ2 ≈8 ns) only contributes a small amplitude to the total signal.
As the temperature increases, the relative contribution of the slow component increases, while its lifetime decreases monoto- nously up to 120 K. This behavior is consistent with previous studies of exciton dynamics in layered perovskites,43 where the fast component is associated with the radiative lifetime of excitons within the light cone.
As the temperature increases, the growing phonon population leads to an increased scattering rate of excitons out of the light cone.
These momentum-dark excitons created by exciton−phonon scatter- ing can either be scattered back into the light cone or recombine via nonradiative decay channels, and the combina- tion of these processes contributes to the slow component and the decrease of its lifetime.
An alternative explanation for this behavior is a relaxation into lower-lying dark exciton states, as there is a significant energetic splitting between optically bright (triplet) and dark (singlet) excitons in layered perovskites44 on the order of about 10 meV. After relaxation into these dark states, excitons can either recombine nonradiatively or be thermally excited back into the bright states.45 In the temperature range from 6 to 120 K, the time- integrated PL intensity also decreases monotonously (see Figure 2c) due to the increased probability of excitons accessing nonradiative decay channels via exciton−phonon scattering, consistent with previous studies.33,46 We observe a clear change of the TRPL dynamics as the temperature increases to 140 K, as both fast and slow component lifetimes increase significantly, accompanied by a small increase in time- integrated PL intensity.
The drastic jump in lifetimes coincides with the temperature range where a crystallographic phase change, from orthorombic to tetragonal, is observed for 3D (MA)PbI.47−50 Although steady-state PL in our samples shows no drastic energy shift in that temperature regime, our TRPL data suggest an impact of such a phase change on exciton− phonon interaction and nonradiative decay channels.
Alter- natively, the increase in lifetimes and PL intensity could be attributed to the thermal energy matching the dark−bright exciton splitting, allowing for the efficient thermal activation of dark exciton states.
As the temperature is increased further, the fast and slow component amplitudes and time constants start to approach similar values, and above 220 K, the PL decay becomes monoexponential with a lifetime of about 2 ns.
Together with the further decrease of time-integrated PL intensity, this indicates that exciton−phonon scattering is so prominent that hardly any recombination can occur before excitons are scattered out of the light cone and that the rate for nonradiative decay becomes larger than the rate for back- scattering into the light cone.
Given our insight into the photoluminescence dynamics from TRPL and the absence of polarization in steady-state PL experiments, we can infer that spin relaxation in our samples has to occur on time scales that are a small fraction of the recombination times.
To resolve these fast dynamics, we turn to pump−probe experiments.
Spin Relaxation and Photocarrier Lifetimes.
To gain insight into the photocarrier dynamics and their spin relaxation mechanism at short time scales, we use a two-color pump− probe spectroscopy setup with a temporal resolution of ∼700 fs.51 We use a circularly polarized pump pulse (either σ−or σ+), to induce a spin polarization of certain helicity into the system.52 The out-of-equilibrium carrier population and spin polarization can be simultaneously detected by recording the total differential reflectivity (≡TRΔR) and ellipticity through polarization-resolved differential reflectivity (≡TRKE) signals, as depicted in Figure 3a.
Depending on the induced spin polarization, the TRKE signal flips its sign, as shown in Figure Figure 2.

Therefore, pure spin dynamics can be separated out from spurious, non-spin-dependent signals by subtracting TRKE traces for opposite excitation helicity: i.e., TRKE(σ−) − TRKE(σ+).
In the following discussion, we refer to the subtracted TRKE signal as the TRKE signal, if not explicitly stated otherwise.
To find suitable parameters for further measurements, different probe and pump laser configurations were tested.
At a sample temperature of 6 K and a fixed pump energy of 2.17 eV, the probe energy was varied from 1.8 to 2.1 eV, as shown in Figure 3c.
This pump energy is above the calculated band gap energy of 2.08 eV. The signal amplitude maximum is close to the X0 resonance, which is expected for a Kerr ellipticity resonance curve.51,53 The slight red shift can be explained through the pump laser induced carrier densities and a resulting band gap renormalization.54 For all following TRKE measurements, a probe laser energy of 1.89 eV is used.
Having found the optimal probe energy, we also tested the influence of the pump energy.
Figure 3d shows exemplary Kerr traces for pump energies of 2.08 eV (at the calculated band gap) and 2.17 eV (90 meV above the calculated band gap).
While we observe a difference in maximum signal amplitude, which can be attributed to the variation in the absorption coefficient at the given energies, there is no discernible change in the spin dynamics due to the excess energy.
This indicates that energy relaxation does not induce additional spin relaxation in the energy range.
We note that this observation is in contrast to a previous study by Todd et al., where a pronounced decrease in spin relaxation time was observed as excess energy was increased.36 For all the following TRKE measurements, the pump energy was kept fixed at 2.08 eV to obtain the optimum signal-to-noise ratio.
In order to compare the TRΔR and TRKE data to the (time-resolved) PL measurements, we need to consider important differences between the measured signals, as follows.
(1) In our PL measurements, we can clearly associate the observed emission with the radiative recombination of excitons based on the emission energy, which is about 200 meV below the single-particle band gap.
For the radiative recombination process, energy and momentum conservation applies, so that only excitons with a very small center-of-mass momentum (within the so-called light cone) can radiatively recombine and contribute to the PL signal.
The dynamics of the PL signal are therefore, e.g., sensitive to scattering of excitons out of the light cone and backscattering of high-momentum excitons back into the light cone, as well as formation of dark excitons.
(2) In our pump−probe measurements, we drive interband transitions at the band gap with our pump pulse, while probing close to the exciton resonance with our probe pulse and either tracking its change of intensity or its change of ellipticity as a function of time delay.
In either case, changes to the probe pulse are related to a bleaching of the absorption at the probe energy due to state filling and resultant Pauli blocking.
This state filling can occur via single carriers in the valence or conduction band or via bound electron−hole pairs (excitons), so that the differential reflectivity and ellipticity signals cannot be unambiguously attributed to excitons or single carriers, even when the probe energy is tuned to the excitonic transition.
In fact, the resonant enhancement of Kerr rotation and ellipticity around an excitonic transition is regularly used to track the spin dynamics of resident carriers in semiconductor nanostructures at time delays well after exciton recombination is complete.33,47 We also note that Kerr rotation and ellipticity measure spin polarization (uncompensated spins per unit area), in contrast to HRPL, which measures the degree of spin polarization (the percentage of uncompensated spins).
Thus, in TRKE spec- troscopy, a decrease in the Kerr amplitude can originate either from spin relaxation or from the loss of the spin carriers themselves via recombination.
This makes it essential to know the photocarrier lifetime when interpreting the TRKE data.
In our setup, schematically shown in Figure 3a, this was distinctively realized in such a way that TRKE and TRΔR were measured simultaneously (see Methods), ensuring identical measurement parameters and material properties as well as reducing the required measurement time by a factor of 2.
This is specifically important for sensitive materials such as perovskites which suffer from photodegradation.20,55,56 Figure 4a shows simultaneously measured TRKE (solid) and TRΔR (dotted) traces at various temperatures from 5.2 to 300 K. Within the first 50 ps, the TRΔR signal and thus the carrier density remain nearly constant, practically independent of temperature.
On the other hand, the TRKE signal decays completely.
As stated above, we cannot directly attribute the TRKE signal to excitonic spin polarization.
However, given the ultrafast exciton formation time of about 0.3 ps in layered perovskites,57 which is well below our temporal resolution, and Figure 3.

We thus conclude that the spin relaxes within a few picoseconds while the population of photoexcited carriers remains essentially constant on this short time scale.
After the change in x-axis scale, the decay of the TRΔR signal, on the order of nanoseconds and in qualitative agreement with our TRPL results, becomes apparent.
This strong and graphic contrast between spin relaxation and photocarrier lifetime explains why no spin polarization was observed in the steady- state PL measurements (see Figure 1f).
The exciton spin polarization is already lost before a substantial fraction of recombination occurs.
Fitting the individual TRKE and the TRΔR traces with exponential fit functions, the lifetimes τK,K1,K2 and τΔ1,2 are extracted and plotted over temperature in Figure 4b,c, respectively.
We first discuss the TRKE lifetimes in more detail.
From the experimental traces, we can see that at low temperatures, the decay has two components requiring a biexponential fit, but at temperatures of 200 K and more, the traces can be well- described by a single exponential.
We note that Giovanni et al. also observed a biexponential decay in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films at low temperatures with values comparable to our results and attributed the components to the electron and hole spin relaxation.52 However, many other works only utilized single- exponential decay times.32,35,36,41 Without the ability to reliably assign the components of the decay to a specific carrier, e.g., by observing spin precession and extracting the g factors,47,58 and to approximately capture the decay dynamics throughout the whole temperature range of our study, we utilized a monoexponential fit with lifetimes denoted by τK in Figure 4b.
Clearly, we observe only a weak temperature dependence of τK throughout the whole temperature range, with a decrease from about 6 ps at liquid-helium temperature to about 4 ps at room temperature, with most of the decrease occurring at temperatures above 200 K. Given the significant changes in exciton recombination dynamics evidenced in TRPL, and the obvious changes to the phonon population and exciton− phonon interaction with rising temperature, this is rather unexpected.
To put this observation into perspective, we review the potential spin relaxation processes discussed in previous studies.
Mostly, either the Elliott−Yafet (EY)59,60 or the Dyakonov−Perel (DP)61 mechanism has been suggested to be the dominant spin relaxation mechanism in layered perovoskites.35,36,52 The main difference between both mechanisms is how momentum scattering influences the relaxation: in the EY mechanism, with each momentum scattering event, there is a finite possibility for a spin flip so that increased scattering rates reduce the spin relaxation time.
In the DP mechanism, relaxation occurs due to spin precession in an effective, momentum-dependent magnetic field, which may result from Dresselhaus- or Rashba-type spin−orbit interaction.
Momentum scattering leads to random fluctua- tions of the orientation and magnitude of this effective field and causes relaxation of a spin ensemble.
In the common motional narrowing regime, the product of precession frequency ΩK averaged over the whole ensemble and the momentum scattering time τ* is smaller than unity (ΩKτ* < 1), and the spin relaxation time τs is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering time: * K 1 2 s , so that increased momentum scattering rates increase the spin relaxation time.
Additionally, excitonic spin relaxation in perovskites has been attributed to the exchange Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes29 based on a mechanism developed by Maialle, de Andrada e Silva, and Sham (MSS).62 Here, the electron−hole exchange effectively acts like a fluctuating in- plane magnetic field whose magnitude and direction depend linearly on the exciton center-of-mass momentum K.
In the motional narrowing regime, the MSS mechanism shows a behavior analogous to the DP mechanism.
Naturally, these different mechanisms will yield a different temperature dependence: as the temperature increases, the momentum scattering time decreases due to the growing phonon population.
Additionally, in the case of the EY mechanism, the spin mixing introduced by spin−orbit interaction increases with increasing energy so that the probability for a spin flip during a scattering event also increases, leading to a monotonous decrease of spin relaxation time with increasing temperature.
By contrast, in the case of the DP and MSS mechanisms, the decreasing momentum scattering time should increase spin relaxation time with temperature.
Additionally, however, an increase in energy and center-of-mass momentum will also increase the effective field and corresponding precession frequency ΩK, partially compensating the decreasing momentum scattering time and potentially leading to a complex, nonmonotonous temperature dependence of the spin relaxation time.
With these qualitatively different temperature dependences, our observa- Figure 4. (a) Selected TRKE (solid) and TRΔR (dotted) traces of a temperature series measured from 5.2 to 300 K. Excitation and probe laser energies are fixed at 2.08 and 1.89 eV, respectively.
The x-axis scale is changed at 50 ps to accommodate the strongly contrasting decay in TRKE and TRΔR amplitude, while the individual traces are normalized for better comparability.

Given the few-picosecond absolute values of the spin relaxation time observed in our study, it is likely that a significant fraction of the exciton spin relaxation occurs before they reach thermal equilibrium with the lattice, especially at low temperatures, so that the increasing phonon population only impacts the momentum scattering rate at intermediate temperatures.
Next, we discuss the differential reflectivity results.
Both τΔ1 and τΔ2, extracted from the TRΔR data, remain rather stable over the whole temperature range, in contrast with the TRPL lifetimes.
However, we do observe an increase of both time constants when comparing the measurements at 100 and 150 K, followed by a decrease of both time constants as the temperature is increased further, qualitatively matching the behavior observed in TRPL, albeit not as pronounced.
Such a discrepancy can be expected, as the TRPL dynamics strongly depend on exciton center-of-mass momentum, while TRΔR probes the individual occupation of conduction and valence bands at the probe energy and is thus rather insensitive to the temperature-dependent exciton−phonon scattering processes discussed above.
However, we note that both TRPL and TRΔR lifetimes are of the same order of magnitude and far exceed the observed spin relaxation times.
It is interesting to contrast the dynamics observed in our perovskite samples with those of other 2D systems.
Here, two well-studied yet very different examples are semiconductor quantum wells based on direct gap semiconductors like GaAs and monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).
For excitons in GaAs-based quantum wells (QWs), spin relaxation is driven by the MSS mechanism.
At low temperatures, exciton spin lifetimes are typically tens of picoseconds,63 while exciton lifetimes are on the order of about 200 ps, so that a finite circular polarization degree can be observed in steady-state PL.
Spin lifetimes for resident carriers are very different: while hole spin lifetimes are on the order of picoseconds, electron spin lifetimes in QWs strongly depend on parameters like well width and crystal growth direction, exceeding 100 ns in specific cases.
By contrast, in monolayer TMDCs, exciton lifetimes in monolayers are on the order of picoseconds at low temper- atures,64,65 and exciton spin relaxation occurs on similar time scales.66 The main mechanism for spin relaxation is attributed to a long-range Coulomb exchange interaction,67 analogous to the MSS mechanism.
For resident carriers in TMDC monolayers, however, spin and valley relaxation is strongly suppressed due to spin−valley coupling,68 so that spin relaxation times of more than 100 ns for electrons and about 10 μs for holes could be observed.69,70 While in these two examples of 2D systems, exciton lifetimes and spin relaxation times are comparable, albeit on different time scales, so that a finite PL polarization degree is observable in steady-state measurements and spin polarization can potentially be transferred from excitons to resident carriers, the combination of long exciton lifetimes and short exciton spin relaxation times in our samples negates either possibility.
However, we note that this is not generally the case for perovskites, as spin dynamics of resident carriers could be observed in both 2D33 and 3D47 perovskite systems.
CONCLUSION In summary, we have studied spin relaxation and photocarrier dynamics in the layered perovskite (BA)(MA)PbI using several optical microspectroscopy techniques that allow us to address an individual sample encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride layers.
We observe significant changes in the photo- luminescence dynamics throughout the studied temperature range from 6 to 300 K, which also include hints at a crystallographic phase transition at intermediate temperatures.
Both photoluminescence lifetimes and photocarrier lifetimes measured by differential reflectivity are in the nanosecond range.
By contrast, spin relaxation times throughout the investigated temperature range are on the order of a few picoseconds, and the spin dynamics do not change drastically with temperature.
Consequently, in steady-state, helicity- resolved photoluminescence measurements, we observe no spin polarization due to the large disparity of photocarrier lifetimes and spin relaxation times.
Our study motivates further systematic investigations of spin relaxation in layered perov- skites to determine the dominant relaxation mechanism and its dependence on material parameters.
METHODS Sample Fabrication.
The RPP (Ruddlesden−Popper perovskite) (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with a perovskite layer thickness of n = 4 was synthesized and purified following previously reported methods.23,71 The RPPs studied here were mechanically exfoliated and stacked using the dry viscoelastic transfer method72 between hBN onto a Si/ SiO2 substrate.
For the transmission measurement the hBN- encapsulated RPP was stacked on top of a single-mode optical fiber core.21 Optical Measurements.
All optical measurements were per- formed in a flow cryostat with a temperature variability from 4 to 300 K. Inherent to this cooling technique, the sample was kept under a vacuum for the whole measurement time and thus protected from environmental degradation by oxygen and water.
PL and Transmission.
For the steady-state PL measurements, the sample was excited with a 2.33 eV continuous-wave diode-pumped solid-state laser using a power of 10 nW, focused to a diffraction limited spot size of about 1 μm.
The sample was cooled to a temperature of 6 K. The PL light emitted by the sample was collected using the same objective, filtered through a 560 nm (2.21 eV) long- pass filter, and analyzed with a combination of a spectrometer and a charge-coupled device.
To obtain the PL map of the sample (Figure 1b), the cryostat, with the sample inside, was moved in relation to the fixed laser spot through a computer-controlled xy stage.
The polarization-resolved measurements were achieved by placing a linear polarizer and an achromatic quarter-wave plate (λ/4) in the excitation and detection beam path.
The laser intrinsically emits linearly polarized light, and both linear polarizers were set parallel to this orientation throughout the measurements.
For the copolarized configuration the fast axis of both λ/4 was set to an angle of either 45° or −45°, while for contrapolarization one was set to 45° and the other to −45° or inverted.
The angle was measured between the fast axis of λ/4 and the orientation of the linear polarizers.
For the transmission data white light from a Xe lamp was coupled into the single-mode fiber, which had the sample on the other side (compare sample fabrication).
The varied white light signal was then collimated and reflected via a multimode fiber into a spectrograph.
The whole setup was inside a helium exchange dip stick inside a He Dewar.
The time-resolved PL was measured with a 3.06 eV pulsed diode laser, a 10 MHz repetition rate, and an excitation power of 10 nW. The temporal pulse width of the laser used in that power regime was around 50 ps, so the instrument response function was mostly defined by the detection.
Here, the fundamental laser wavelength was filtered out by a 450 nm (2.72 eV) long-pass filter, while the PL signal was measured through a commercial single photon avalanche diode using time-correlated single photon counting electronics. TRKE and TRΔR.
In our TRKE-TRΔR setup, two separately energetically tunable pulsed lasers (Toptica: femtoFiberPro) were ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.3c09001 ACS Nano 2023, 17, 25459−25467 25464used, one for the pump and the other for the probe laser beam.
Each system emitted with a pulse repetition rate of 80 MHz (pulse repetition period of 12.5 ns), a spectral width of 6 meV, a pulse duration of about 210 fs, and a tunable energy range from 480 to 700 nm (1.77−2.58 eV).
Probe and pump pulses were electronically time- synchronized and amplitude-modulated with different chopping frequencies, adding up to a sum modulation frequency of 922 Hz.
A mechanical delay line changed the path length of both beams and, thus, the time offset of both pulses.
Here the pump and probe paths were shortened and elongated, respectively, yielding a maximum measurement time interval of 4 ns.
Through an achromatic λ/4 plate, the pump beam was circularly polarized to either left- or right-handed chirality.
Both beams were set to a laser power of 20 μW and were focused with a 20× objective onto the sample, yielding a spot size of 3 μm and excitation power density of 7 W/cm2.
After reflection the pump beam was filtered out by a band-pass filter while the polarization and signal amplitude of the probe beam were measured.
The polarization of the probe beam was analyzed for its ellipticity by a combination of a λ/4 plate, a Wollaston prism, and two photodiodes (ThorLabs PDB210A Si Photodetector).51,53 The difference signal of the two diodes was fed into a lock-in amplifier, yielding a TRKE signal.
The sum signal of the diodes was obtained by using an external adder and fed into a second lock-in amplifier, yielding the TRΔR signal.
Both lock-in amplifiers were fed the same reference frequency given by the modulation sum frequency (922 Hz).
The setup is schematically shown in Figure 3a.
With this approach, it was possible to measure the TRKE and TRΔR at the same time, cutting the needed measurement time in half, compared to, as commonly performed, subsequent measurements.
The TRKE setup is described in detail elsewhere.51 AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author Tobias Korn −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany; orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-391X; Email: tobias.korn@uni-rostock.de Authors Michael Andreas Kempf −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany Philipp Moser −Walter Schottky Institute, TUM School of Natural Sciences, Technical University of Munich, 85748 Garching, Germany Maximilian Tomoscheit −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany Julian Schröer −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany Jean-Christophe Blancon −Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005-1827, United States Rico Schwartz −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany Swarup Deb −Institute of Physics, Rostock University, 18059 Rostock, Germany Aditya Mohite −Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005-1827, United States Andreas V.
