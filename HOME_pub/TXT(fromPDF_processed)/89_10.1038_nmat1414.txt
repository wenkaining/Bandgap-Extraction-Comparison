Defects are known to modify the electrical  resistance of carbon nanotubes4; they can be present in as-grown  carbon nanotubes, but controlling their density externally opens  a path towards the tuning of the electronic characteristics of the  nanotube.
In this work, consecutive Ar+ irradiation doses are applied  to single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) producing a uniform density  of defects.
Aft er each dose, the room-temperature resistance versus  SWNT length (R(L)) along the nanotube is measured.
Our data  show an exponential dependence of R(L) indicating that the system  is within the strong Anderson localization regime.
Th eoretical  simulations demonstrate that mainly di-vacancies contribute to the  resistance increase induced by irradiation, and that just a 0.03% of  di-vacancies produces an increase of three orders of magnitude in the  resistance of a SWNT of 400 nm length.
Th e traditional approximation to reduce the size and enhance the  performance of electronic devices may not be applicable in the near  future5.
Th ere is now great expectation for properties of electronic  circuits based on molecules.
For the case of electronic circuits based  on carbon nanotubes6, the infl uence of disorder and defects4,7 is of  fundamental relevance in the performance of the device.
In particular,  the density of defects would determine the transport in nanotubes  from a ballistic regime8,9 to either weak or strong localization regimes.
Quantum theory dictates that for a one-dimensional conductor of length  L10,11, with a given density of defects, localization eff ects emerge when  the ‘phase coherence length’ Lϕ is larger than the localization length L0.
If L is not too large (for L about 3–10 L0) and the inelastic interaction is  weak, the wire resistance is controlled by the phase-coherent electron  propagation12, falling into the strong localization regime in which the  resistance increases exponentially with the length of the wire.
Th is  regime has not been observed in single-walled nanotubes in spite of  much evidence for a weak localization diff usive regime and quantum  interference in multiwalled carbon nanotubes13.
By changing the  density of defects, L0 can be modifi ed allowing control of the resistance  of the one-dimensional conductor.
Induced defects have already been used to modify diff erent  properties of carbon nanotubes.
Indeed, an electron beam has  been used to create in situ nanotube junctions14 and to enhance  the mechanical response of nanotube bundles by creating stable  links among the tubes15.
Th eoretically, the eff ects of vacancies16,  topological defects17 and random disorder18,19 on the electronic  transport of the nanotube have been investigated.
Surprisingly, few  experimental results have been published concerning the transport  regime of localization and, to our knowledge, no experimental  evidence of the infl uence of controllably induced defects on the  variation of the electrical resistance with the length of single-walled  carbon nanotubes has yet been reported20.
To study this issue we  have irradiated SWNTs with Ar+ ions and measured the electrical  characteristics of the same metallic carbon nanotube, aft er each  irradiation, by using a conductive atomic force microscopy  (Cervantes AFM, Nanotec Electrónica S.L.) at room temperature.
In addition, the measured low-voltage-resistance (LVR) data was  theoretically analysed using a combination of density functional  methods and Green’s functions techniques.
A metallic AFM tip was used to measure the current versus  voltage characteristics (I–V) of the nanotubes as a function of the  distance between the metallic AFM tip, used as a mobile electrode,  and a fi xed macroscopic gold electrode21.
Briefl y, the experiments  were performed as follows: a metallic SWNT was fi rst selected  (Fig. 1a) and electrically characterized.
From the I–V plots the LVR  was determined along the tube by fi tting a straight line to the data  around zero volts.
In this way a resistance versus length curve R(L)  is obtained (Fig. 1a).
Th e experimental setup enables us to increase  the force applied by the mobile electrode to the SWNT until an  optimum contact resistance is reached22.
All  the  individual  metallic  SWNTs  probed  in  our  experiments  exhibit  a  nonlinear  R(L)  at  low  voltage  as  expected  for  a  strong  Anderson  localization  regime10.
Th e low-bias resistance data can be fi tted by: R(L) = Rc + ½R0exp(L/L0)          (1) Nature  Publishing Group © 2005LETTERS nature materials | VOL 4 | JULY 2005 | www.nature.com/naturematerials  535 where Rc is the contact resistance, R0 is the inverse of the quantum  of conductance G0 = 2e2/h (where e is the charge on the electron and  h is Planck’s constant; the ½ factor in equation (1) accounts for the  two conductance channels of a metallic SWNT, see below) and L0  is the localization length.
Th e exponential resistance comes from  an interference eff ect by coherent backscattering of electrons at  the defects.
Figure 1b shows R(L) for the selected nanotube before  ion irradiation.
Th is 1.4-nm-diameter SWNT exhibits metallic I–V  characteristics, compatible with a (10,10) armchair nanotube.
Th e  furthest distance an I–V curve was acquired was ∼700 nm (the uncover  length of the nanotube) from the gold electrode.
Th e closest curve  was taken at the minimum distance for which the tip is clearly not  in contact with the gold electrode that is, 50 nm.
Rc = R(0) is linearly  extrapolated from the closest electrode measurements to be 50 kΩ.  Th is is a typical contact resistance for individual SWNTs using gold  contacts8.
By fi tting the data to equation (1), a value of L0 = 216 nm  is found.
On repeating the measurements along the same nanotube  we obtain the same L0 within a 5% error, indicating that the AFM tip  does not introduce any measurable damage along the SWNT.
In the  case of 14 diff erent metallic SWNTs we fi nd an average localization  length L0 = 231 nm with a standard deviation of ±117 nm (see Fig. 1  for diff erent R(L) sets of data in three diff erent nanotubes).
We have  examined nanotubes from two diff erent sources, HipCo (Carbon  nanotechnologies) and arc-discharged (M.T. Martinez group at  Instituto de Carboquimica, Zaragoza, Spain) and both presented  similar features, indicating that defect control in SWNT synthesis  is still an issue.
High-quality metallic carbon nanotubes grown by  carbon vapour deposition exhibit very long low-bias mean-free- paths as large as one micrometre, the resistance being controlled by  the weak scattering with acoustic phonons8,9.
However, as the scope  of the present work is to assess the dependence of the localization  length in metallic carbon nanotubes on defect concentration and  tube length, the quality of the initial nanotubes sample is not relevant.
Aft er this fi rst characterization, the nanotube sample was  irradiated with an Ar+-ion beam with energy of 120 eV (see  Methods for details).
Aft er each ion dose the same nanotube is again  electrically characterized fi nding a decrease in the localization  length from 216 nm, before irradiation, to 61 nm for the fourth  dose (the data are summarized in Fig. 2a).
Notice that this drop in  the localization length causes a change in resistance for L = 400 nm  of about two orders of magnitude.
Further irradiation doses (not  shown) produced even higher resistances at this point.
Taking  into account the ionic current, the sample area, the irradiation  time, the energy, and assuming a (10,10) nanotube, the number of  Ar+ ions colliding per SWNT nanometre length can be estimated  (see table in Fig. 4c).
Th is estimation is corrected by a factor of  1.3 when the trajectories of the Ar+ ions for the experimental  electrode geometry are simulated (SIMION 3D 7.0).
In addition  to the increment on the LVR of the SWNT, Fig. 2a also shows a  small increment of the contact resistance with the irradiation time  200 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 LVR (kΩ) LVR (kΩ) 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 LVR (kΩ) RC = 50 kΩ LO = 216 nm RC = 50 kΩ LO = 170 nm RC = 40 kΩ LO = 421 nm 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 L (nm) 200 500 0 1,000 1,500 2,000 400 600 800 L (nm) L (nm) A V L I(V,L)        R(L) a b c d Figure 1 Experimental setup.

Using molecular dynamic simulations, Krasheninnikov et al.23  suggested that Ar+ collisions mainly create mono-vacancies and  di-vacancies along the nanotube.
In particular, their simulations  for a 120-eV Ar+-ion beam impinging perpendicular to the tube  axis of a (10,10) nanotube show that di-vacancies appear in about  30–40% of the impacts (private communication).
Th is is important  for the rationale behind the observation of the strong localization  regime and in quantitative agreement with the estimations from our  experiments, as discussed below.
In this work we have performed simulations using a fi rst- principles local orbital density-functional method (FIREBALL)24  to calculate the relaxation around the defects and the eff ective local  orbital hamiltonian (an sp3-basis set of  orbitals was used with a cut- off  radius of 2.15 Å).
Th e advantage of this approach is that it provides  a means of calculating the LVR using standard Green-function  techniques derived for tight-binding hamiltonians25 but now with  the accuracy of fi rst principles.
Within this theoretical framework,  as explained in the Methods, we are able to calculate the diff erential  conductance g for a realistic tube with a given number of defects  (mono-vacancies or di-vacancies) that are randomly distributed  along the nanotube (Fig. 3a).
Th is numerical tool allows us to make a  quantitative comparison between theory and experiments.

a, There are two possible orientations for the di-vacancies.
We deﬁ ne the orientation  of the di-vacancy as the vector connecting the two missing atoms.
The vertical case  (with its orientation perpendicular to the nanotube direction) is less stable than the  lateral one (with their orientation partially parallel to the tube axis) by 2.0 eV; then  we can safely assume that Ar+ irradiation only creates either mono- or lateral di- vacancies.

The resistance is shown just after each di- vacancy plane, and the length of the nanotube is obtained by multiplying the number  of defects in the x axis by the mean distance between the di-vacancies.

Nature  Publishing Group © 2005LETTERS nature materials | VOL 4 | JULY 2005 | www.nature.com/naturematerials  537 Before discussing the behaviour of long tubes it is worth  discussing the low-bias conductance drop associated with a single  defect (either mono-vacancy or di-vacancy) at zero temperature.
A  perfect (10,10) metallic SWNT presents a conductance of 2G0.
Our  calculations show a conductance of 1.98 G0 for the mono-vacancy  and 1.36 G0 for the lateral di-vacancy (see inset in Fig. 3b).
Clearly,  the mono-vacancy represents a very small scattering of the electron  propagation along the nanotube compared with the di-vacancy.
Th is  already suggests that we can safely neglect the mono-vacancy eff ect  on the fi nal low-bias conductance and concentrate on analysing the  di-vacancies (this is confi rmed by extensive calculations including  mono- and di-vacancies that are not presented here).
Figure 3b portrays the nanotube LVR at zero temperature  calculated as a function of its length for a mean distance between di- vacancies, d = 28.5 nm (the length of the nanotube can be inferred by  just multiplying the number of defects by d).
Several cases are shown  corresponding to diff erent random confi gurations of di-vacancies; the  LVR mean value in the log scale26 is also presented (black line), and  was obtained aft er averaging over 90 random cases (the grey region  in Fig. 3b represents the mean-square-root deviation).
Remarkably,  an exponential dependence of the LVR mean value versus length  of the nanotubes is clearly present in our simulations.
Th is result is  general and supports the view that, in the experiments, Anderson  localization is causing the observed increase in resistance.
However,  the strong conductance fl uctuations calculated for each confi guration  (Fig. 3b) are not seen in our experimental data.
Th is is due to the  energy window of the injected electrons, of the order of kBT (where  kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is temperature), which introduces  signifi cant diff erences in their phase-coherent propagation along the  tube.
If Lϕ is much larger than L0 (as in the case at low bias in our  samples), the condition LT ≤ L0, (with LT  = (ħvF)/(kBT) being the  thermal coherent length, ħ is h/2π, and vF the Fermi velocity), defi nes  the regime for which the phase shift s of the electrons (and their  corresponding conductances) when travelling through L0 change  signifi cantly within the energy window.
Th en, the conductance  of each and every single electron does indeed fl uctuate with the  nanotube length but, importantly, these fl uctuations are diff erent for  electrons injected with diff erent energies.
Th erefore, it is expected  that the measured conductance, which has the contribution of a large  number of electrons, would not fl uctuate, yet the exponential decay in  the conductance is still present.
Th is line of reasoning is corroborated  by our numerical simulations.

Nature  Publishing Group © 2005LETTERS 538  nature materials | VOL 4 | JULY 2005 | www.nature.com/naturematerials eff ects by showing our calculated LVR at room temperature for two  of the random confi gurations of defects analysed in Fig. 3b.
Clearly  the LVR now presents a smooth exponential behaviour that is similar  (within a 30% accuracy) to the mean value found for the random  confi gurations.
Th e low-bias conductance G (LVR is just the inverse  of G) at room temperature is calculated by integrating the diff erential  conductance, g, over an energy window defi ned by the derivative of  the Fermi distribution function (see Methods for details).
Th e inset in  Fig. 3c shows lng as a function of electron energy (E) for one of the  random confi gurations containing 25 defects.
Th e sharp peaks and  the strong fl uctuations of that conductance are a clear indication of  the strong Anderson localization regime for the electrons propagating  along the nanotube.
For zero temperature, G = g(EF) and G is therefore  extremely sensitive to the particular confi guration of defects.
However, at room temperature, the integration over the energy  window eliminates the fl uctuations in the conductance (or resistance)  as a function of the nanotube length, still yielding an exponential  behaviour in the LVR, in agreement with the qualitative arguments  presented above.
In this paper, we have calculated the LVR using only  the mean value of the conductance for the random confi gurations at  the Fermi level, an approximation that yields a reasonable accuracy to  the LVR at room temperature, although an improved analysis should  incorporate thermal eff ects for all the nanotube lengths and all the  random confi gurations (work in this area is in progress in our lab).
Figure 4a shows the averaged LVR calculated for diff erent density of  defects in the nanotubes with d ranging from 2.9 to 75.5 nm.
In all cases  we observe the strong localization regime.
To make this localization  eff ect more evident, we show in Fig. 4b the calculated values for the  localization length, L0, as a function of d.
We get two distinct regimes:  (i) for lower defect density (that is, large values of d, d>5 nm), L0 depends  linearly on d, L0 ≈ 4.1 d. (ii) For higher defect density (small values of  d), L0 saturates to a value close to 23 nm.
In our experiments the defect  density is always below 0.15% corresponding to case (i).
To compare experiments and theory quantitatively we have to take  into account the initial density of defects (most likely substitutional27)  of the nanotube before irradiation giving rise to the initial localization  length (L0)in of 216 nm.
Assuming that the total localization length is  obtained by Mathiessen’s rule as [(L0)total]–1 = [(L0)defect]–1 + [(L0)in]–1  ((L0)defect being the localization length due to defects induced upon  irradiation), (L0)defect is easily found for each irradiation dose from  the experimental (L0)total obtained using equation (1).
Once (L0)defect is  known from the experiments it can be compared with the calculated L0.
Th is allows us to estimate the average distance between di-vacancies,  d, for each L0.
If we now compare d with the estimated number of ion  collisions per nanometre we infer an effi  ciency of the Ar+ ion beam  of one di-vacancy every four ion collisions, which is in quantitative  agreement with ref. 23.
Th e experimental and theoretical results are  summarized in the table shown in Fig. 4c.
Th ese arguments combined with the data presented in Fig. 4  tell us that, due to localization eff ects, only 0.03% of di-vacancies  produce an increment of three orders of magnitude in the resistance  of a 400-nm-length segment of a metallic nanotube.
Th is explains  why, although the consequences of the presence of defects in the  nanotube electronic transport are so noticeable, we have not  observed any morphological change within the resolution of the  AFM in the nanotube structure under irradiation, even when the  tube electrically fails at L = 420 nm in the last irradiation dose (see  Fig. 2 and table in Fig. 4c).
For the sake of completeness it is worth discussing briefl y the high- voltage case.
As our experimental I–V plots were obtained by ramping  the voltage from –2.5 eV up to +2.5 eV, the high-voltage resistance  (HVR) can also be obtained, allowing us to assess the infl uence of  defects in the HVR.
Th is study is of relevance for nanotube applications  as the current-carrying capacity of perfect carbon nanotubes is limited  by phonon emission.
In fact, measurements9,12 in high-quality metallic  nanotubes show a very short electron mean-free-path of 10–30 nm at  high bias due to scattering with optical phonons28.
From the point of  view of the electron propagating along the wire, the main eff ect of a  high voltage is to substantially increase its electron–phonon inelastic  scattering, which tends to favour a diff usive conductivity in the sample.
Th is is seen in our experiments for voltages higher than 0.3 eV: in this  limit, the nanowire resistance shows a linear dependence versus length,  instead of the exponential behaviour found at low bias, confi rming the  change in the conductance regime.
A set of measured I–V plots (see  Fig. 2b) acquired at the same spot of a metallic SWNT for diff erent  irradiation doses exhibit a LVR ≈ 0.3 HVR for the SWNT before ion  irradiation; as the number of defects grows the situation is reversed  and eventually the experimental data show LVR ≈ 3 HVR.
In this case  the HVR is mainly dictated by electron–phonon coupling, whereas the  LVR exhibits strong signatures of Anderson localization induced by the  defects.
By taking the measured HVR as a function of the length for  each irradiation dose, we can estimate the mean free path l, as l = R0L/R  (ref. 9).
Th is shows that l varies from 30 nm before irradiation, in good  agreement with electron mean-free-paths due to the electron–phonon  interaction9,12, to 12 nm for the highest irradiation dose.
A careful  theoretical analysis is required to better understand these results.
Our determination of the extreme importance of defects (in  particular di-vacancies) on the low-bias conducting properties of  SWNTs irradiated with an Ar+-ion beam has not only fundamental  relevance, but also opens new paths to tailoring the electrical properties  of future nanotube devices using ion irradiation.
METHODS EXPERIMENTS Th e irradiation was performed at an Ar pressure of 1.0 × 10–4 mbar.
Th e ion energy used was 120 eV.  We applied irradiation doses during consecutive periods of 5 or 10 seconds.
A 0.1 µA ionic current is  measured on the macroscopic electrode (1.8 cm2 area) where the nanotubes are contacted.
Below 70 eV energy we do not observe any conductance drop in the irradiated SWNTs.
For doses  longer than one minute at 120 eV, the resistance of the irradiated sample is so high that the current  fl owing through the individual SWNTs is below our sensitivity (∼0.1 nA).
THEORY Th e simulation geometry consists of a device region with the nanotubes with defects connected to two  semi-infi nite perfect tubes (S1 and S2) that act as left  and right electrodes (see Fig. 3a).
In this approach,  the diff erential conductance g(E) is calculated at the tube–lead interface S2 from:     g (E) (E) (E) = 4πe2 h Tr [ [ D ρ T (E) ρ A LL R LL (E) LL 22 L2 D T2L – ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ     (2) where Tr represents the trace of the operator in brackets.
T  ∧  L2 describes the coupling between the  right end of the nanotube and lead 2, ρ ^ 22(E) being the density of states matrix associated with the  decoupled (T ^ L2 = 0) semi-infi nite lead 2 projected at S2 and related to the retarded Green’s function  (g ^ 22 R) by ρ ^ 22 = (–1/π)Img ^ 22 R. For calculating g ^ 22 R we use standard decimation techniques.
ρ ^ LL(E) is the  density-of-states matrix projected onto the right end of the nanotube and is calculated by an iterative  procedure that is started on the side S1 and includes, at each step, a new layer of the tube.
Aft er N  steps, we build the whole tube and their corresponding retarded and advanced Green’s functions  g ^ LL R (A) (with the projection of the electronic states of lead 1 incorporated).
In this way, we can include  straightforwardly a random confi guration of defects distributed along the nanotube with a given  mean distance between them (see Fig. 3a).
Th e retarded and advanced denominator functions D ^  appearing in equation (2) are given by:          g g (E) = D R(A) LL (E) [ [ I – T R(A) R(A) LL 22 L2 (E)T2L –1 ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ     (3) At zero-temperature, the low-bias conductance G is calculated by just evaluating g at the Fermi energy,  g(EF).
If we are interested in obtaining G at a temperature T, we have to evaluate the following integral:            g dfT  dE dE (E) G =∫ ∞ –∞ ( ( –   (4) where                                                                                                                     (E) = fT 1 E–EF kBT e + 1 is the Fermi distribution function.
Nature  Publishing Group © 2005LETTERS nature materials | VOL 4 | JULY 2005 | www.nature.com/naturematerials 539 Within this theoretical framework, it is feasible to calculate the low bias conductance of very long  nanotubes (up to several micrometres long) with an arbitrary distribution of defects dispersed on them.
