However, it was only observed at extremely low temperatures due to the low ferromagnetic Curie temperature and the tiny magnetically induced gap.
To fully understand the mechanism of the ferromagnetic ordering, thereby improving the ferromagnetism, we investigated 4f transition metal doped Bi2Se3, using density functional theory approaches.
We predict that Eu and Sm can introduce stable long-range ferromagnetic states in Bi2Se3, with large magnetic moments and low impurity disorders.
Additionally, codoping is proposed to tune the Fermi level into the gap, which simultaneously improves the magnetic moment and the incorporation of magnetic ions.
Our ﬁndings, thus, offer a step in facilitating the realization of QAHE in TI systems.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.94.054113 I. INTRODUCTION The quantum Hall effect (QHE), characterized by the quantized Hall conductance, with the formation of Landau levels under an external magnetic ﬁeld, was observed in two-dimensional electron systems more than 30 yr ago [1,2].
As ﬁrst proposed by Haldane [3], by circulating currents loop on a honeycomb lattice, the QHE can exist even without the external magnetic ﬁeld and the formation of Landau levels, namely, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).
However, the Haldane model is difﬁcult to realize experimentally.
Later, numerous models were proposed to realize QAHE in realistic materials, including magnetically doped quantum wells [4–7], transition metal (TM) oxide heterostructures [8–13], graphene/silicene [14–19], magnetic topological insulator (TI) thin ﬁlms [4,20–25], and others [26–28].
However, the QAHE was only reported to be successful in Cr and V doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 magnetic TI thin ﬁlms [29–35].
The key idea for the realization of QAHE is to introduce the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking perturbations, e.g., a ferromagnetic order in TIs, usually by doping the TI with magnetic impurities [29–35].
The introduced exchange splitting can destroy the band inversion in one of the spin channels, while keeping the nontrivial band topology in the other spin channel due to the spin-orbital coupling, which opens up a ﬁnite gap at the Dirac point and leads to the QAHE [36].
The reason for choosing the TI system, especially the Bi2Se3 family, which has been proved successful in QAHE, is that besides its strong (spin-orbital coupling) SOC and a single-surface Dirac cone, the ferromagnetic orders can be derived directly from the large Van Vleck spin susceptibility in the host without the mediation of itinerant carriers [23], which eventually makes the QAHE possible.
However, the QAHE observed from recent experimental observations typically *jyzhu@phy.cuhk.edu.hk occurs at extremely low temperatures because of the low Curie temperature (TC) and small magnetically induced band gap [29–35], hindering its realistic applications.
Therefore, of crucial importance is to ﬁnd alternative magnetic impurities to increase the TC, as well as the nontrivial band gap for QAHE.
The 3d TMs, such as Cr and V, have proved successful in creating insulating ferromagnetic states in Bi2Se3 family for QAHE purpose.
Besides these 3d TMs, the 4f TMs may be better candidates for introducing ferromagnetic orders in Bi2Se3.
First, as the 4f TMs have ionic radii larger than the 3d TMs, they will match the Bi2Se3 lattice better than the 3d TMs do, naturally giving rise to smaller distortion and therefore less disorder.
Also, the 4f bands typically have a more localized character and should be less interactive than the 3d bands.
This could be beneﬁcial in avoiding the impurity aggregation that have been observed in Cr doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 [37], which are responsible for the magnetic disorders, Indeed, our ﬁrst-principles calculations further conﬁrmed this expectation, given that the 4f impurity (e.g., Nd) is favorable to distribute uniformly in the Bi2Se3 lattice to form a long-range order, while the 3d TM (e.g., Cr) has a tendency of aggregating.
Another advantage of the 4f TMs should be attributed to their large atomic mass, which enables stronger SOC with respect to 3d TMs, and this will probably lead to a larger magnetically induced band gap, together with stronger FM order due to the Van Vleck mechanism [23].
Furthermore, f bands normally have two more electronic orbitals than d bands so that they are able to introduce a larger magnetic moment that is crucial to en- hance the quantized Hall conductance plateau in QAHE [38].
Until now, however, a systematic investigation is still lacking.
In this paper, to address the above questions, we investigated the 4f TMs doped Bi2Se3, by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
We conﬁrmed that the 4f TM impurities are energetically more favorable to stay on the Bi substitution sites than the 3d TM impurities are, revealing a suppression of impurity disorders.
Among these 4f TMs, several of them can introduce large magnetic moments and be strongly coupled in the FM states.
Typically, Eu and Sm show 2469-9950/2016/94(5)/054113(8) 054113-1 ©2016 American Physical SocietyDENG, ZHANG, ZHANG, WANG, HE, AND ZHU PHYSICAL REVIEW B 94, 054113 (2016) large magnetic moments of 6.33 and 5.06 μB, respectively, both with strong FM character.
The calculated FM coupling strength is ∼3−4 times larger than that of Cr impurity, as reported in previous works [39].
Besides, Tb and Dy are also energetically favorable to introduce large magnetic moments, whose coupling favors moderately stable FM states.
Moreover, to realize insulating FM states for QAHE, we proposed that by codoping donor impurities with the magnetic ions, such as Eu, the Fermi level can be tuned into the gap, and the magnetic moments and the incorporation of the magnetic ions can be simultaneously enhanced. II.
COMPUTATIONAL METHOD AND DETAILS In this paper, we use the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code [40], with spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) [41] functional for exchange correlation.
Projector- augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [42] for Bi, Se, and 4f TMs were used with a planewave basis-set cutoff energy of 300 eV, while 4f states and 5d states were included in the valence.
The SOC was included in the total energy and electronic structure.
Besides the PBE functional, we also considered the screened Hartree-Fock hybrid density functional (HSE06) [43] and GW approximation [44] to test the general applicability of the PBE results.
It shows that the formation energies of the 4f impurities given by PBE, HSE, and GW differ by less than 5%, which reveals the reliability of the PBE functional.
The Bi2Se3 has a rhombohedral structure composed of three weakly coupled quintuple layers (QLs).
To maintain a reasonable interaction among the QLs, we included the van der Waals interaction in the calculation [45], and obtained the lattice constants a = 4.19 ˚A and c = 28.54 ˚A, which can be compared to experimental values a = 4.14 ˚A and c = 28.64 ˚A [46].
The geometry of isolated impurities was modeled by using a 60-atom supercell, consisting of 2 × 2 × 1 conventional Bi2Se3 cells in the hexagonal lattice.
A -centered 7 × 7 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack mesh was used for k-point sampling in the Brillouin zone.
In obtaining the geometry, all the atoms are allowed to relax until the calculated Hellmann-Feynman forces are less than 5 meV/ ˚A.
We calculated the formation energy of TM impurity on the Bi site (TMBi), various interstitial sites (TMi), and the Se site (TMSe) of Bi2Se3, which allows us to investigate the spin- dependent electronic structure of the impurities.
The defect formation energy is deﬁned as [47] Hf (TM) = Etot(Bi2Se3 : TM) −Etot(host) −  i niμi (1) where Etot (Bi2Se3:TM) is the total energy of a supercell containing one charge neutral impurity; Etot (host) is the total energy of the defect-free supercell; ni is the number of atoms of a certain element added to (ni < 0) or removed from (ni > 0) the supercell; and μi is the chemical potential of that element.
The chemical potentials should fulﬁll the following conditions: (i) 2μBi + 3μSe = Hf (Bi2Se3) to keep the host material thermodynamically stable; (ii) xμTM + yμSe ⩽ Hf (TMxSey) to avoid formations of secondary phases of FIG. 1.

THE FORMATION OF 4 f IMPURITIES IN Bi2Se3 We ﬁrst consider the TMs at the interstitial sites and substitutional Se sites, as these impurities, TMi and TMSe, often cause impurity disorders with large changes in the electronic structure, whereby leading to a deterioration of the magnetic ordering, and hence should be avoided.
Our calculations reveal that the 4f impurities are unlikely to occupy these detrimental sites.
Consider for example, the TMis.
There are two types of them in the Bi2Se3 lattice, namely, the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, each with six different conﬁgurations.
We have examined all of them and found that the most stable one is on the octahedral site between two QLs.
Yet, it’s signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to form TMi than to form TMBi, as the formation energy of TMi is at least 1.08 eV higher than that of TMBi at the most favorable Bi-rich conditions.
This difference is noticeably larger than the reported 0.29 eV for the 3d TM impurities [39], showing that the 4f TMs are energetically more favorable on the Bi sites, which reveals an improvement against the impurity disorders as in the 3d TM doped case, due to the relatively large sizes of the 4f TMs that better match Bi than the 3d TMs do.
Next, we examine eight selected TMBi impurities, which are Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er.
The calculated formation energies are shown in Fig. 1, as a function of the Se chemical potential.
Except for EuBi, SmBi and HoBi, the calculated formation energies are always negative, regardless of the growth conditions.
This is in line with experimental observation that a number of the 4f elements can form continuous alloys with Bi2Se3 and/or Bi2Te3 [48–51].
Note that Eu and Gd have a signiﬁcantly large formation energy difference (>1.3 eV), even though they are adjacent neighbors 054113-2REALIZATION OF STABLE FERROMAGNETIC ORDER IN . . .

in the periodic table.
As this difference cannot be understood solely by the atomic-size difference, we have studied the effect of atomic chemical potentials on the formation of these impurities (see Fig. 2).
We found that to avoid the formation of secondary phases, in particular, TM selenides, the maximum chemical potential of Eu is −4.11 eV, which is 0.43 eV lower than that of Gd (−3.68 eV) at equilibrium.
The reason for a lower chemical potential of Eu lies in its exceptionally stable secondary phase EuSe, where Eu has a valence +2, leaving behind a very stable half-occupied f band, according to Hund’s rule.
The lower chemical potential for Eu here is consistent with the larger impurity formation energy.
The remaining formation energy difference between Eu and Gd may be attributed to their different electronic structures; while GdBi has occupied f bands deeply buried inside the valence band, EuBi has its partially occupied bands near the Fermi level; hence, EuBi cannot be nearly as stable as GdBi. IV.
MAGNETIC CHARACTERS OF THE 4 f IMPURITIES Due to the crystal ﬁeld splitting [52,53] in Bi2Se3, the f bands of the TMBi impurities may split by coupling to the p states of the host, which lowers the f band degeneracy.
At the same time, if the system has a spin-degenerate ground state, the spin-up levels will have an exchange interaction with the spin-down levels, leading to an exchange splitting between the two, thereby lowering the total energy of the system.
Assuming that the exchange splitting is larger than the crystal ﬁeld splitting, the f orbitals are most likely to be occupied by electrons of parallel spin, leading to a high-spin conﬁguration with large magnetic moment; otherwise, the electrons will have higher tendency to occupy the levels with antiparallel spin, giving rise to a low-spin ground state.
To investigate such magnetic behavior, we calculated the magnetic moments for all 4f TMs and listed the results in Table I.
These results suggest that while the crystal ﬁled splitting of those 4f impurities is generally weak in Bi2Se3, the corresponding exchange splitting is relatively large, which is preferred for the QAHE.
We note that among all the candidates, GdBi and EuBi have the largest magnetic moments, 7 and 6.33 μB, respectively, in the direction perpendicular to Bi2Se3 QLs.
These values are greater than the maximum of 5 μB ever possible for 3d TM impurities [39].
A stable long-range magnetic order depends not only on the local magnetic moment but also on the coupling of the magnetic moments in the same direction.
To estimate the magnetic coupling in a solid, one usually places two TM impurities in a supercell, with a set of different distances, and then calculates the magnetic coupling strength EFM-AFM/2 (deﬁned here as a half of the energy difference between the FM and AFM states).
In this paper, the magnetic conﬁguration for ferromagnetic states is achieved by setting the two magnetic ions with the same and parallel spin, while the antiferromagnetic conﬁguration is realized by setting the two magnetic ions having the same spin but with an antiparallel direction.
By using this approach, we found that the strongest magnetic coupling between TM impurities typically happens at the second-nearest-neighbor distance within the same QL (whose energy difference, when signiﬁcant, is given in Table I) and decays at the third-nearest-neighbor distance (by about 15% per neighbor-distance, suggesting an effective doping concentration of 7.5%), while the coupling of impurities between QLs can be noticeably smaller.
The results show that the FM coupling is favorable in Sm and Eu doped Bi2Se3 and moderately favorable in Tb and Dy doped Bi2Se3, while the Er and Gd doped Bi2Se3 favors a weak AFM coupling.
Note that massive Dirac fermion has been observed experimentally in Dy doped Bi2Te3 up to room temperature [51], implying the TRS breaking due to the existence of an FM order.
Nd in Table I represents a different case in which the nearest-neighbor FM coupling (21 meV) is the strongest, but the second nearest-neighbor coupling is only 1 meV. To further our understanding, we then focus on the elec- tronic band structure and projected density of states (PDOS), shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(f), for Eu and Gd.
Note that while the Gd doping preserves the insulating nature of the Bi2Se3 host, the Eu doping leads to a p-type character.
Correspondingly, the band gap is calculated to be 79 and 30 meV, respectively, for Gd and Eu doped systems, larger than the reported 22 meV for the Cr doped case [39].
This can be understood as a combined result of the p-f couplings near the valence band maximum (VBM) and the SOC.
It is known that the 4f states are normally more localized than the 3d states, with a weaker coupling to the p states near the VBM.
This is typiﬁed by the localized impurity states inside the band gap for Eu, as TABLE I. Magnetic moments and magnetic coupling strengths (EFM-AFM/2) of eight 4f TM impurities.

can be seen in Figs. 3(b) and 3(e).
Moreover, for Gd, the impurity bands are much deeper, about −3.5 to −4.5 eV below the Fermi level, as revealed by Fig. 3(f), due to the extra f electron of Gd.
While according to the Hund’s rule, having seven electrons half occupying the f shell makes the Gd impurity very stable, the lower f bands also make the p-f coupling less signiﬁcant than the Eu doped case, so the band gap of Bi2Se3:GdBi is also noticeably larger than Bi2Se3:EuBi.
Besides, with their larger atomic mass the 4f TMs, in contrast to 3d TMs, have a reasonably stronger SOC with the host, which is also responsible for the obtained larger gaps.
We note that while the electron correlation in GGA functional may underestimate the band gap, the implementation of on-site Coulombic correction U could further enhance the gap, yet it may reduce the magnetic coupling [23,54].
To verify this, we have considered an on-site Coulombic correction (GGA + U) to the 4f states of Eu.
The on-site Coulombic term was parametrized with U = 7 eV and J = 0.75 eV, respectively [55].
The electronic structure provided in Fig. 4 shows that the band gap is enhanced to 45 meV with the Coulombic correction.
However, simultaneously the magnetic coupling strength will undergo a reduction of about 17%, FIG.
4. Calculated (a) band structure and (b) projected density of sates for Eu doped Bi2Se3, using GGA + U approach.
The Fermi level is set to zero, as indicated by the dashed line.
The SOC is also taken into account in the calculations.
The above band structures provide us with a qualitative picture for the obtained FM and AFM states in Eu and Gd doped Bi2Se3, which could also be extended to other systems.
The strong FM coupling in the Eu doped system is suggested to originate from the exchange coupling between Eu impurities via the intervening Se atoms.
The 4f states of Eu will exhibit splitting by coupling to the 4p states of Se under the approximate Oh symmetry of the crystal ﬁeld of Bi2Se3, resulting in higher-lying p-f hybridized t1u states and lower-lying t2u and a2u states, and then the t1u states could be further mixed with the higher relativistic 4f7/2 states, and the t2u and a2u could be mixed with the lower relativistic 4f5/2 states, due to the spin-orbital coupling.
Then, the exchange splitting will give them a rigid shift, resulting in two impurity bands.
In the FM states, the coupling between the impurity bands and the p states near the VBM lowers the lower-lying majority-spin states [see Fig. 5(a), the outmost panels] and raises the partially occupied higher-lying majority-spin states near the Fermi level [see Fig. 5(a), the second outmost panels].
Then, coupling between the higher-lying impurity states across the impurities [see Fig. 5(a), the middle panel] lowers the total energy of the system.
In the AFM states, in contrast, coupling between the low-lying majority-spin states [i.e., those 054113-4REALIZATION OF STABLE FERROMAGNETIC ORDER IN . . .

in Fig. 5(b), the outmost panels] and the high-lying unoccupied minority-spin states (in the conduction band) takes place [see Fig. 5(b), the middle panel].
While such a coupling can also lower the total energy of the system, the exchange splitting between the majority and minority spins is quite large for the 4f impurities, which counteracts and leads to a smaller energy gain.
Therefore, the FM state is the ground state in Eu doped Bi2Se3.
This, however, does not happen in the Gd doped system, because the majority-spin states of Gd are deep inside the valence band and merely weakly coupled to the p states near the VBM, so an FM coupling on such fully occupied states cannot gain the system much energy.
Instead, the AFM coupling will be more favorable.
This rationale is supported by the calculated weak AFM state for Gd doped Bi2Se3 in Table I, which also supports the recent experiment [48].
Moreover, we noticed here that Sm also favors a strong FM state, with a large magnetic moment of 5.06 μB and low formation energy of 0.12 eV. Also, the FM coupling strength for Sm ions is 44 meV, even stronger than for Eu.
From a previous calculation by Chen et al. [56] and in conjunction with the calculated PDOS in Fig. 3(e) for EuBi, we see that SmBi has an electronic structure similar to EuBi but with one less f electron.
The coupling between the lower-lying fully occupied impurity bands and the higher-lying partially occupied impurity bands with one less electron generally should lead to a larger energy gain.
These results provide strong evidence for the recent experiment [56], where the stable FM state in 5% Sm doped Bi2Se3 samples was observed at 52 K. V. THE MAGNETIC CODOPING Successful QAHE in a TI system requires that the mag- netically doped system remains to be insulating and that the magnetic impurities have a sufﬁcient concentration to achieve a long-range order.
Therefore, for Eu or Sm doped Bi2Se3 to realize QAHE, it is essential to be able to raise the Fermi level into the band gap.
One possible strategy is to incorporate with the TM the right amount of n-type dopants, such as group VII anions or group IV cations.
As such, a codoping can also change the band occupations, the magnetic moments, and the magnetic coupling for the TM impurities.
Its overall effect needs be addressed. FIG. 6.
The calculated electronic (a) band structure and (b) density of states for the Eu-I codoped Bi2Se3.
The Fermi level is set to zero, as indicated by the dashed line.
The SOC is included in the calculation.
We then performed calculations on the Eu and donor codoped Bi2Se3 system.
For the Eu and I codoped system, the calculated electronic structures are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b).
We noted that accompanied with the lowering of the f bands of Eu, the Fermi level of the system shifts up into the band gap, and the gap is further enhanced to 55 meV (80 meV, with the inclusion of U), which is strongly preferred for the QAHE.
This is attributed to the charge transfer from the donor’s (I) p states to the acceptor’s (Eu) f states, which lowers the energy position of thef bands and, in turn, stabilizes the electronic structure of the system.
Also, the lowering of the f bands reduces the p-f coupling at the VBM, which accounts for the obtained larger gap.
Simultaneously, the Eu substitution will have relatively larger magnetic moments but reasonably lower ferromagnetic coupling strength (see Table II), suggesting that the magnetic moments and their coupling can be sensitive to charge compensation induced by the donors.
However, by our results, the isolated donors cannot create magnetic moment in the absence of Eu; thus, the enhanced magnetic moment cannot be interpreted in terms of the spin-spin interaction between the donors.
Instead, we note that there is a charge transfer from the p states of the donors to the s, as well as the majority-spin f states of Eu, leading to different band occupations.
A larger occupation of the EuBi majority-spin states results in the larger magnetic moment.
On the downside, however, this charge transfer also leads to a larger occupation of the partially occupied impurity states, raising the total energy of the magnetically coupled system and, in turn, lowering the coupling strength.
This explains why the FM coupling strength of Eu is always lowered upon the codoping.
Nonetheless, the donor-compensated Eu still has a reasonably strong FM coupling strength above 054113-5DENG, ZHANG, ZHANG, WANG, HE, AND ZHU PHYSICAL REVIEW B 94, 054113 (2016) TABLE II.

This insensitivity is due to the exchange coupling being mediated by spin-polarized holes localized at the impurity states, subject to bounded magnetic polarons (BMPs) [57–59], and the magnetism is further enhanced by the Van Vleck mechanism.
To verify this, we subsequently performed calculations on a donor-compensated Sm impurity.
The obtained FM coupling strength is also on the order of 20 meV, in line with the Eu results.
In our view, however, SmBi may not be as promising as EuBi for realizing QAHE in Bi2Se3, because Sm has one less f electron than Eu and behaves as a double donor, so two electron donors are needed to fully compensate one Sm.
A recent experiment has demonstrated a ferromagnetism induced TRS breaking at the Bi2Se3-EuS interface [60], due to the strong exchange ﬁled introduced by the magnetic proximity with the insulating EuS layer, so we believe that such FM states can also be established by Eu doping.
The remaining issue to be addressed is the incorporation of Eu, which is suspected to be more difﬁcult than Cr, given that the calculated formation energy minimum is 0.54 eV, higher than that of Cr (about −0.25 eV) [39].
This, as we discussed earlier, can be understood in terms of the competitive secondary phase and the energy position of the f bands as well.
Within the same way of codoping, unsurprisingly, the +2 valence of Eu can be retained, yet lower formation energy may be achieved.
In particular, the formation energy of Eu can be lowered by 0.02–0.30 eV when codoped with cation donors, and can be lowered by 0.78–0.95 eV when codoped with anion donors.
This is attributedtothechargetransfer fromthedonor’s p states to the acceptor’s (Eu) f states combined with a strain effect [61], which stabilizes the electronic structure of the doped system and, in turn, improves the impurity solubility, and this can be further evidenced by analogical experiments [62–64].
Note that the formation energy of Eu generally can be lowered more when codoped with anion donors.
A more signiﬁcant reduction in the formation energy by the anion donors is because they have shorter distances to Eu, which is on the cation Bi site.
Thus, the anion donors can form a stronger binding with Eu due to Coulombic attraction, which is the strongest for F. After all, Eu is still slightly smaller than Bi.
Hence, a compressive stress on the host can be beneﬁcial for its incorporation.
In this regard, F has the smallest atomic radius and is expected to bring in the largest local compression effect on the host to enhance Eu incorporation. VI.
CONCLUSIONS In summary, our paper conﬁrms several 4f TMs as promis- ing magnetic impurities for stable ferromagnetism in Bi2Se3.
In startling contrast to widely used 3d TMs, the 4f TMs can introduce higher magnetic moments with larger exchange splitting, stronger FM orders, and lower impurity disorders.
The observed magnetic order is proposed to originate from the p-f exchange coupling further combined with the Van Vleck mechanism.
To establish insulating FM states for QAHE, codoping TMs with nonmagnetic donorlike impurities was proposed as a means to tune the Fermi level into the gap and to enhance the solubility of the TM ions inside Bi2Se3.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 94, 054113 (2016) APPENDIX: THE GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE Cr SUBSTITUTION AND Nd SUBSTITUTION IN Bi2Se3 As observed by the recent experiment [37], the introduced 3d TM magnetic impurities, for instance Cr, tend to aggregate with each other to form a trimmerlike structure in Bi2Se3, giving rise to deterioration to the long-range ferromagnetic order.
Our ﬁrst-principles calculation further conﬁrms such a phenomenon, given that the trimmerlike structure of Cr is energetically more stable than the long-range structure in which the Cr ions are uniformly distributed, with the total energy lower on an order of 10 meV. The reason for this can be understood as follows.
First, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the substitution of Cr ions on the Bi site typically leads to a local distortion and a geometric symmetry breaking in the surround- ing ions, due to the large lattice mismatch, and such distortion can be suppressed by forming the aggregation structure [see Fig. 7(b)].
Second, the 3d bands of the Cr atoms are not sufﬁciently localized and are considered to be more active, so these atoms have a tendency to bind together via the interaction between the 3d bands, which can lower the total energy of the system.
However, such a phonemenon does not happen on the 4f TM impurities.
Taking Nd, for instance, in contrast with the above results, our calculation shows that the Nd atoms are energetically more favorable to be uniformly distributed in Bi2Se3, rather than forming the aggregation trimmers, with the energy gain being on the order of 20 meV. The reason for this, as can be seen from Figs. 7(c) and 7(d), is that the 4f Nd substitutions do not introduce such a large distortion in Bi2Se3, as in the 3d Cr doped case, because the Nd atoms reasonably match the Bi2Se3 lattice better.
Moreover, the 4f bands of the Nd atoms are more localized and less interactive, with the long-range magnetic coupling further enhancing their stability.
