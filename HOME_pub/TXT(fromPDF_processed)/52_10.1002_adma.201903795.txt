In this study, we present a route toward the patterning of  TMDs based on the effects of low-energy proton irradiation[17]  on the structural and electronic properties of bulk WS2, WSe2,  WTe2, MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2.
Suitable irradiation conditions  trigger the production and accumulation of H2 just beneath  the first X–M–X basal plane, leading to the localized exfoliation  of the topmost monolayer and to the formation of spherically  shaped domes.
Structural and optical characterizations confirm  that these domes are typically one ML-thick and contain H2 at  pressures in the 10–100 atm range, depending on their size.
Such  high pressures induce strong and complex strain fields acting  on the curved X–M–X planes, that are evaluated by means of a  mechanical model.
The domes’ morphological characteristics can  be tuned by lithographically controlling the area of the sample  basal plane participating in the hydrogen production process.
This  results in the unprecedented fabrication of robust domes with  controlled position/density and sizes tunable from the nanometer  to the micrometer scale, that, by virtue of their inherently strained  nature and geometry, might prompt a variety of applications.
The samples, consisting of thick (tens to hundreds of MLs)  TMD flakes, were obtained by mechanical exfoliation, deposited  on Si substrates, and afterwards proton-irradiated using a  Kaufman source (see the Experimental Methods).
Differently  from the other works in the literature concerning proton- irradiation of TMDs—where beams with energies ≥105 eV are  used,[18] aiming at the controlled formation of defects in the  irradiated samples—here we irradiate the flakes with low energy  At the few-atom-thick limit, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit  strongly interconnected structural and optoelectronic properties.
The possibility  to tailor the latter by controlling the former is expected to have a great impact  on applied and fundamental research.
As shown here, proton irradiation deeply  affects the surface morphology of bulk TMD crystals.
Protons penetrate the top  layer, resulting in the production and progressive accumulation of molecular  hydrogen in the first interlayer region.
This leads to the blistering of one- monolayer thick domes, which stud the crystal surface and locally turn the dark  bulk material into an efficient light emitter.
The domes are stable (>2-year life- time) and robust, and host strong, complex strain fields.
Lithographic techniques  provide a means to engineer the formation process so that the domes can be pro- duced with well-ordered positions and sizes tunable from the nanometer to the  micrometer scale, with important prospects for so far unattainable applications.

The top-right inset of Figure 1a displays the  optical microscopy image of a large bulk WS2 sample after irradi- ation with an impinging dose dH = 8 × 1016 protons cm−2.
Unex- pectedly for indirect-gap bulk WS2, the sample exhibits strong  photoluminescence (PL, see the Experimental Section) in the red  wavelength region (λ ≈ 690 nm), as displayed in the main part of  Figure 1a and Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
The bottom- left inset shows that the luminescence originates from circular  spots with diameters varying between less than one (which is  an upper limit due to the finite resolution of our optical setup;  see the Experimental Section) to few microns.
As is evident  from the atomic force microscopy (AFM, see the Experimental  Section) image in Figure 1b, these spots signal the presence of  dome-shaped features, protruding from the irradiated crystal  surface, with virtually perfect spherical shape (see Figure S2 in  the Supporting Information).
The average footprint radius of  the features displayed in Figure 1b is R = (1.43 ± 0.12) mm—with  maximal height hm = (230 ± 20) nm—but the dome size can be  controlled by the irradiated proton dose: with dH  = 1.0 × 1016  protons cm−2 we obtained nanometer-sized structures, with  average R = (164 ± 40) nm and hm = (25.6 ± 5.6) nm (Figure 1c).
Figure  1d shows an AFM image encompassing three domes  formed on a WS2 sample analogous to that shown in Figure 1c.
The corresponding room temperature micro-PL (μ-PL, see the  Experimental Section) intensity map, detected at λdet = 689 nm  and displayed in Figure  1e, demonstrates the perfect match   between the domes and the light-emitting spots.
The µ-PL spec- trum of one dome (singled out from the ensemble of Figure 1a)   is provided in Figure 1f.
The luminescence of an untreated WS2  ML measured under the same excitation/collection conditions  is shown for comparison.
The PL intensity of the domes is typi- cally larger than that of the exfoliated WS2 MLs, indeed sug- gesting a one-ML thickness for the domes.
This hypothesis is  confirmed by measuring the μ-PL spectrum and the thickness  of the outer layer of exploded domes, which are both fully con- sistent with that of the monolayer (as exemplified for a MoSe2  dome in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).
This is  further supported by the strong circular dichroism measured  for the PL emission of the domes (in a WS2 dome the degree  of circular polarization is >50% at 130 K, see Figure S4A,   Supporting Information), which is a property stemming directly  from the hexagonal symmetry of the first Brillouin zone of  monolayered TMDs (see Figure S4B in the Supporting Informa- tion).[19] Likewise, evidence of the one-ML nature of the domes  is also provided by second-harmonic generation measurements,  Adv. Mater.

Albeit rare, the formation of two- layer thick domes and of Russian-doll-like structures can also  be observed, as exemplified and discussed in Figure S5 in the  Supporting Information.
Based on the percentage of visible domes that double as strong  light emitters (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), at  least 85%–90% of the domes can be estimated to be one-ML thick.
The energy of the PL peak (corresponding to the free-exciton  recombination involving electrons and holes at the K point of the  first Brillouin zone, named as A exciton, as in TMD MLs[1,2]) of a  typical (single-layer) WS2 dome is 200 meV lower than that of the  ML (see Figure 1f), mainly because of the strain exerting on the  dome’s surface,[7,8] as we will discuss in more detail in the fol- lowing.
Notably, no significant linewidth broadening is observed  when many such domes are measured together, as demonstrated  by the PL spectrum of a dome ensemble, displayed in Figure 1f  as a dashed line.
The spectral homogeneity of the light emitted  by the domes suggests that the same average strain is present in  each dome, irrespective of the dome size.
The evidence shown in  Figure 1 demonstrates that indirect-gap bulk WS2 can be turned  into an efficient light emitter with no size restrictions, like those  typically affecting exfoliated flakes or samples grown by chemical  vapor deposition.
We point out that the reported phenomenon  is substantially independent of the specific MX2 composition  (see measurements on H+-treated MoSe2, MoS2, MoTe2, WSe2,  and WTe2 in Figures S6 and S7 in the Supporting Information)  and is exclusively induced by the interaction of the material with  protons.
No effect was found in samples exposed to molecular  hydrogen or ionized helium atoms under the same temperature  and gas flow conditions.
Clues on the internal make-up of the domes can be derived  by following their low-temperature evolution.
Figure  2a,b  shows, respectively, the 300 and 4 K optical microscopy images  of a bulk WS2 sample irradiated with dH = 8 × 1016 protons cm−2.
At 300 K, many domes—featuring iridescence, as accounted for  below—are visible.
For T ≲ 30 K the domes disappear, and the  sample surface looks conspicuously flat.
As T is increased, at  ≈30 K, the domes bulge suddenly (within our system resolution  equal to 10 mK, see insets of Figure 2c and Movie 1 (Supporting  Information)).
As illustrated in Figure  2c, the transition tem- perature distribution was sampled over more than 500 domes  obtained on several proton-irradiated flakes deposited on dif- ferent substrates (see the Experimental Section).
The resulting  average transition temperature is (32.2 ± 2.4) K, a number close  to the critical temperature of H2 (33.18 K) and thus compatible  exclusively with the presence of molecular hydrogen inside the  domes (see Note S1 in the Supporting Information): when T is  sufficiently low/high, H2 liquefies/boils, and the domes deflate/ inflate always in the same position.
The fluctuations observed in the liquid-vapor transition tem- perature (T HLV) are chiefly due to the spread in the size (and  hence in the internal pressure) of the domes.
To reinforce our  hypothesis, we considered the study of isotopic effects in our  system and we repeated our analysis on 500 more WS2 domes,  obtained by deuteron irradiation.
The (p–T) phase diagrams of  hydrogen and deuterium[20] show an isotopic shift in the tem- perature at which the liquid-vapor phase transition occurs of  about 2.9 K (the exact value depending on the pressure of the  gas).
The details of our measurements are discussed in Note S1   in the Supporting Information.

KGaA, Weinheim 1903795  (4 of 8) www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com deuteron-irradiated samples is displayed in Figure  2c (see  Figure SN1A for the histogram in the Supporting Information):  differently from proton-irradiated samples, the behavior is in  this case characterized by a composite shape, corresponding  to the three different steps that are apparent in the cumulative  function.
We ascribe empirically these three steps to the pres- ence of H2, HD, and D2 molecules[21] within the domes.
There  are several possible explanations why H may be present also  in deuterium-treated samples: (1) even the highest purity deu- terium bottles contain a 0.25% of H2 and HD molecules; (2) it  has been reported that deuterons permeate through graphene  and BN monolayers much slower than protons: At room tem- perature the areal conductivity of deuterons results to be 1/10  of that of protons.[22] This effect could be even much stronger  in the case of TMDs, whose single layer is constituted by three  atomic planes; (3) the hydrogen evolution reaction is expected  to be remarkably faster with respect to the deuterium evolution  reaction because of the high mass difference between the two  isotopes.[23,24] For deuteron-irradiated samples, a sigmoidal fit  was thus performed only to the high-temperature data of the  cumulative function shown, where no effect from hydrogen is  expected.
The fit estimates a transition temperature of T DLV =  (35.7 ± 4.3) K, resulting in a difference between the centers of  the distributions equal to (3.5 ± 0.4) K, consistent with the (p–T)  diagram of the two isotopes.
Indeed, the measured transition  temperatures are consistent only with the presence of H2 (or its  isotopes) within the domes (see Figure SN1B in the Supporting  Information).
We can therefore hypothesize that, during irra- diation, accelerated protons penetrate through the top MX2  basal plane (Figure 2d top), becoming confined in between two  X–M–X layers.
The penetration process is indeed ruled by the  potential barrier met by protons at the interface with the bulk  flake, which should be determined by both the binding energy  profile of protons[25] and the electric fields/charges establishing  at the sample surface.[26] Therein, likely triggered by the cata- lytic activity of TMDs, which might be similar to the electro- catalysis in aqueous solution,[14–16] the following reaction takes  place 2H 2e H2 + → + −  (1) with electrons e− being supplied from the ground contact  or possibly also from the bulk flakes themselves (Figure  2d  middle).
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the for- mation of domes is strongly quenched in flakes deposited on  an insulating substrate (Kapton tape).
The subsequent build-up  of H2 molecules, stored just beneath the top surface, leads to  the local blistering of one X–M–X plane, and eventually to the  formation of the domes (Figure 2d bottom).
The above scenario  is supported by theoretical studies, which showed that thermal  protons remain trapped in the metal plane of X–M–X layers  and do not diffuse, thus favoring the accumulation of H2 mole- cules in the interlayer regions.[25] An estimation of the number  of molecules accumulated after irradiation (via AFM measure- ments and the mechanical model described in the following)  indicates that <3% of the impinging protons penetrate and lead  to the formation of molecular hydrogen, the remaining part  likely being rejected by the potential barrier met at the sample  surface, in agreement with previous studies concerning proton  irradiation of solid matrices.[27] The formation of localized  nucleation sites (i.e., the domes), rather than the establishment  of a uniform H2 distribution underneath the top layer, is due  to the van der Waals (vdW) forces existing between adjacent  planes, which prevent H2 molecules from moving freely.
The  shape of the domes itself—i.e., their height-to-radius ratio— results from the interplay between: (i) the vdW forces that tend  to keep the TMD layers together, thus minimizing the dome  radius; (ii) the stiffness of the top TMD layer, which limits the  dome height; and (iii) the tendency to expand of the trapped  gas, which results in the application of a constant pressure  on the dome’s walls.[6] We estimate such pressure to be about  10 atm for R ≳ 500 nm, given the average T HLV = 32.2 K and  the H2 phase diagram (see Note S1 and Ref. [20]).
Therefore,  the multicolored appearance of the large domes in Figure  2a  can be ascribed to Newton’s rings caused by the interference of  the light reflected inside the H2-filled spherical volume.[28] As noted earlier and shown in Figure 1f, the average PL peak  energy of the domes is about 200 meV lower than that of the  corresponding material in the ML form (see also Figure S7 in  the Supporting Information).
This is ascribable to the pres- ence of tensile strain, ε , which reaches its maximum εm at the  domes’ summit.
As predicted by Hencky’s model[7,29,30] / m m 2 f h R ε υ ( ) ( ) = ×  (2) where f only depends on the material’s Poisson ratio, v, while  R and hm are the dome footprint radius and maximum height,  respectively; see Note S2 in the Supporting Information.
As  reported in Ref.
[6], the dome’s height-to-radius ratio is largely  independent of the dome’s dimensions: hm scales linearly with  R, and the value of εm in a given material can be estimated by  Equation (2).
As shown in Figure 3a, wherein the experimental  (i.e., obtained by AFM) values of  m h  are plotted as a function  of R for six different chemical compositions, the expected  linear dependence is verified over a wide span of dome sizes  (R between 100 nm and ≈3 µm).
The average values of hm/R  estimated for each of the investigated materials are: 0.16 ± 0.02  (MoS2), 0.18 ± 0.02 (MoSe2), 0.17 ± 0.02 (MoTe2), 0.16 ± 0.02  (WS2), 0.15 ± 0.01 (WSe2), and 0.13 ± 0.02 (WTe2) yielding the  values of εm shown in Figure  3a and in Note S2 in the Sup- porting Information.
The height profile of the dome and the evolution of the  strain tensor across the dome’s surface can both be computed  via finite-element method (FEM) calculations, performed  within the framework of nonlinear membrane theory (see  Note S3 in the Supporting Information).[29] As an illustrative  case, Figure  3b (left) shows the comparison between these  calculations and the AFM profile of a MoS2 dome with R  =  (3.76 ± 0.12) µm and hm = (618 ± 15) nm, formed after irradia- tion of a flake with 8 × 1016 protons cm−2.
As summarized in Figure SN3A in the Supporting Informa- tion, FEM simulations correctly reproduce the experimental  profile for all the investigated materials.
The calculated spatial  dependences (0 ≤ r  ≤ R) of the principal components of the  strain tensor—namely, along the circumferential (εt) and radial  (εr) in-plane directions[29] and along the perpendicular (εz) out- of-plane direction—are also displayed in Figure SN3A (right)  (Supporting Information): interestingly, strain is isotropic  Adv.

KGaA, Weinheim 1903795  (5 of 8) www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com biaxial (εt  = εr  = 1.97% for the dome in Figure  3b) only at  the very top of the dome, gradually becoming uniaxial as the  circumferential component goes to zero near the dome’s edge.
In between these two limits, strain is anisotropic (εt  ≠  εr), with  a negative perpendicular component accounting for a compres- sion in the out-of-plane direction (as detailed in Note S3 in the  Supporting Information).
The complex spatial dependence of  the strain tensor across the domes is reflected by the spatial  evolution of μ-Raman measurements where, as a general fea- ture, a progressive softening of the in-plane and out-of-plane  vibrational modes is observed with increasing strain over the  dome.
Due to the diffraction-limited size of our laser spot  (directly measured and modeled by a Gaussian with standard  deviation σ  = 0.23 ± 0.01 µm, see the Experimental Section),  the finer details of this evolution can only be appreciated on  large (R > 2 µm) domes: μ-Raman measurements were there- fore performed on WS2, MoS2, and WSe2, where large domes  were fabricated, giving results in good agreement with the lit- erature[7] discussed in Figures S8–S10 in the Supporting Infor- mation.
Our results agree well also with Hencky’s model,[7,29]  yielding εm = εt  = εr  =  1.95% for the MoS2 dome shown in  Figure 3b (the same applies to the other MX2 compounds inves- tigated; see Note S3 in the Supporting Information).
Moreover,  the pressure values used in the calculations match rather well,  for µm-sized domes, with the ≈10 atm estimated from the  average T HLV obtained in the previous section (see Figure 2c).
For smaller (R << 1 µm) domes, the model results in internal  pressures in excess of 100 atm—as shown in Figure SN3B in  the Supporting Information and reported in Ref.
[6]—for which  H2 should enter a supercritical fluid phase.[31] The strain tensor evolution described by our model and con- firmed by Raman measurements also allows the remarkable PL  emission intensity characteristic of our domes as well as the  PL energy position to be justified.
The observed redshift is in  fact quantitatively consistent with the estimated strain, as dis- cussed for the WS2, MoS2, WSe2, and MoS2 domes in Figure S7  in the Supporting Information.
Due to the seamless reduction  of the excitonic gap with increasing strain, on the other hand,  the formation of domes results in the creation of a deformation  potential landscape for both electrons and holes, able to funnel  the carriers towards the potential minima before recombining  and thus giving rise to an enhanced PL emission.
Such pro- cess, being at the origin of the bright luminescence observed in  large electron–hole plasma droplets in locally strained germa- nium,[32] was also similarly observed in TMDs,[33,34] where exci- tons were demonstrated to drift for hundreds of nanometers  before recombining.[34] The detailed knowledge of the evolution of the strain tensor  across the domes’ surface is particularly relevant since strain is  known to alter profoundly the electronic properties—and hence  the optical and transport properties—of TMDs, which can lead  to, e.g., the emergence of giant pseudo-magnetic fields and to  the generation of persistent currents.[10–13] For this to happen,  specific and stable configurations of the strain field need be  achieved, and spatial control and durability are therefore neces- sary.
In fact, other methods for the creation of strained TMD  bubbles either allow size/position controllability but lack dura- bility (as in Refs.
[7,9]) or permit to create durable structures  lacking any spatial ordering (as in Ref.
[6]), in both cases con- siderably limiting their potentiality for applications.
As shown in Figure S11A in the Supporting Informa- tion, indeed, the domes created via proton-irradiation remain  intact—and keep exhibiting strong light emission—for tem- peratures up to 510 K. In addition, the shape and size of  these nano/microstructures remain unchanged with time— in the best cases over more than two years—as illustrated by  Figure S11B–F in the Supporting Information.
This confirms  the notable absence of gas-permeable, nanometer-scale pores  in TMD materials, as already reported in the literature;[7]  moreover, the exceptional durability of our domes is likely also  aided by the strong adhesion forces existing between the ML  forming the dome and its parent substrate, as well as by the  low permeability to H2 of the latter.
In the bulging devices com- monly employed to induce strain in TMD membranes[7–9] the  ML is usually laying directly on a SiO2 substrate.
As a result,  the devices typically deflate within weeks, mostly due to leaks  Adv. Mater.

The domes’ formation process via low-energy  proton-irradiation is indeed characterized by a high yield, the  domes usually forming over the entire irradiated flakes, as  shown in Figure S12 in the Supporting Information.
This allows  the dome formation process to be engineered, as illustrated  in Figure  4 that can be achieved by depositing an H-opaque  masking layer prior to proton irradiation.
The sample displayed  in Figure  4, for example, was patterned by electron-beam  lithography with arrays of circular openings with diameter   S = 1, 3, and 5 µm (see Figure S13 in the Supporting Informa- tion and Ref.
[35]), followed by proton irradiation (dH = 4 × 1016  protons cm−2) and by the removal of the H-opaque mask (see  the Experimental Section).
Figure 4a displays the AFM image  of a WS2 array of neatly arranged single domes with average  R = (0.93 ± 0.07) µm and hm = (0.13 ± 0.02) µm, obtained for  S = 3 µm.
The µ-PL signal emitted by the same array is imaged  in Figure 4b (see also the µ-PL map in the inset).
The ability to  fabricate ordered arrays of light-emitting domes is an inherent  advantage of our system with respect to, e.g., the bubbles  forming because of the accidental incorporation of contaminant  gases between monolayers and their supporting substrates,[6,36]  which have been shown to be durable[37] but lack any spatial  ordering.
The dome dimensions can also be engineered by  varying the size of the openings in the H-opaque mask.
In fact, Figure  4c shows the distributions of the dome foot- print radii grouped into randomly formed and ordered dome  subsets obtained during the same proton-irradiation process.
It is worth noting that the domes formed using the litho- graphic approach are characterized by a remarkably narrower  size distribution, where the size is clearly determined by the  diameter of the aperture.
Such distribution gets even nar- rower with decreasing the dome size.
Finally, in the ordered  arrays, the average dome volume scales with the surface area  (0.25πS2) available to the reaction  (1) (see Figure S14 in the  Supporting Information), thus supporting the hypothesis of  the dome formation as a catalysis-driven process.
We point  out that controlling the dome position and size over large  areas is valuable for the creation of efficient site-controlled  photon emitters, as well as in many other situations.
For  example, TMD MLs have been shown to give rise to efficient  second-harmonic generation (SHG), due to their broken inver- sion symmetry.[38,39] This property is retained by our domes  —as demonstrated in Figure  4d for an ordered array of WS2  domes excited at 900 nm, which could thus conceivably act as  site-controlled SHG “hot spots,” ideal for the integration with  specifically designed photonic crystal cavities.[40,41] One should  also notice that the intense second-harmonic signal featured  Adv.

The distribution of randomly formed domes during the same process is given by gray bars.
The distribution width is illustrated on top of the figure by horizontal bars.
The inset is an optical microscopy image comparing random versus ordered  (S = 3 µm) domes.
The much narrower distribution of the ordered domes with respect to the random ones can be appreciated.
d) Second-harmonic  (SHG) map collected on an array of ordered WS2 domes obtained after proton irradiation (dose dH = 1.5 × 1017 protons cm−2) of a flake patterned with  an H-opaque mask.
The mask had elliptical openings with 2 and 1 µm semiaxes and 4 µm center-to-center distance.

ML TMDs have been demonstrated to possess intriguing opto- electronic and mechanical properties, which render them suitable  for flexible and innovative optoelectronic devices.
Furthermore,  they have emerged as a fascinating class of materials for catal- ysis.[15] While irradiation of these materials with energetic (MeV)  beams has been shown to modify their properties due to the  creation of defects,[18] here we demonstrated that irradiating bulk  TMD flakes with a low energy proton flux leads to the formation  and accumulation of hydrogen and enables the control of the  electronic properties of ML TMDs at the nano- and micro scale  through the creation of light-emitting, highly strained domes.
The irradiation process proposed here therefore allows the  morphological and optical properties of the flakes to be altered  without the creation of defects (as demonstrated by the stability  of the domes, see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information,  and by optical measurements, see Figure S15 in the Supporting  Information), resulting into relatively large areas characterized by  efficient light emission, due to the creation of the domes.
These  structures can be formed at the desired location and with con- trollable size on six different compounds.
Since we can precisely  control the amount of H2 in single domes, they can act as micro- scopic calibration gauges for H2 sensors or for controlled delivery  of reactive gas (see Figure S16 in the Supporting Information) in  nanoreactors[42] with unprecedented accuracies.
The engineered  formation of domes also allows the creation of arrays of linear  and nonlinear light emitters and of periodic strain fields, as here  demonstrated.
Finally, it should be noted that several other 2D  crystals—such as graphene, h-BN, and phosphorene—have  been found to be virtually transparent to protons, according to  both experiments[43] and theoretical calculations.[25] Therefore,  their deposition on top of bulk TMD samples before proton irra- diation should not hinder the dome formation process, and the  controlled formation of (ordered) TMD domes could thus be  exploited to define a template for modulating strain in a much  wider range of 2D materials, leading, e.g., to the emergence of  giant pseudo-magnetic fields in graphene.
Thanks to the spatial  control enabled by our method, these latter could be created in  the desired periodic configurations, which have been predicted to  result in the generation of dissipation-less electrical currents.[10–13] Experimental Section An extensive description of sample preparation and proton irradiation  procedure, of phase transition, optical, and structural measurements,  and of sample patterning can be found in the Supporting Information.
