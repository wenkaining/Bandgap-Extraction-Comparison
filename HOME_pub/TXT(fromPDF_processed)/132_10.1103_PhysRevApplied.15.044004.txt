The microcavity consists of a curved dielectric distributed Bragg reﬂector with radius of approximately 10 μm paired with a GaAs-based heterostructure.
The heterostructure consists of a semiconductor distributed Bragg reﬂector followed by an n-i-p diode with a layer of quantum dots in the intrinsic region.
Free-carrier absorption in the highly-n-doped and highly-p-doped layers is minimized by our positioning them close to a node of the vacuum electromag- netic ﬁeld.
The surface, however, resides at an antinode of the vacuum ﬁeld and results in signiﬁcant loss.
These losses are much reduced by surface passivation.
The strong dependence on wavelength implies that the main eﬀect of the surface passivation is to eliminate the surface electric ﬁeld, thereby quenching below-band-gap absorption via a Franz-Keldysh-like eﬀect.
An additional beneﬁt is that the surface pas- sivation reduces scattering at the GaAs surface.
These results are important in other nanophotonic devices that rely on a GaAs-vacuum interface to conﬁne the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevApplied.15.044004 I. INTRODUCTION Concepts in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) can be implemented with use of semiconductors.
A semiconductor-based microcavity can be created with a micropillar [1–3], a photonic crystal cavity [4,5], a whispering-gallery resonator [6], and an open microcavity [7–9].
Quantum dots (QDs) within these structures mimic atoms.
In the limit of a single QD, a single-photon source can be realized by exploiting the weak-coupling regime of cavity QED [10].
The strong-coupling regime of cavity QED has been accessed with three diﬀerent microcavity platforms [1,4,9].
In all these semiconductor-based applications of cav- ity QED, minimizing the absorption and scattering losses in the microcavity is very important.
For single-photon sources operating in the weak-coupling regime, eﬃcient *richard.warburton@unibas.ch †These authors contributed equally to this work.

photon extraction from the microcavity is essential [2,3].
In the strong-coupling regime, a coherent exchange between an exciton in the QD and a photon in the micro- cavity is possible only if the exciton-photon coupling exceeds the rate of photon loss.
Typically, this requires the development of low-mode-volume, high-Q-factor micro- cavities.
A recurring theme in the development of such microcavities is the role of the GaAs surface.
At the semi- conductor surface, the symmetry of the lattice is broken.
The GaAs surface is quite complex—there are a num- ber of possible surface reconstructions—and a thin oxide layer typically forms on exposure to air [11].
Reducing surface-related absorption is crucial in the development of GaAs-based cavity QED.
Recently, considerable success in implementing cavity QED was reported with a QD in an open microcavity [7–9,12].
The “bottom” mirror is a semiconductor dis- tributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR) and the “top” mirror is a curved dielectric DBR.
The position of the bottom mir- ror can be tuned in situ with respect to the position of the top mirror, allowing a single QD to be brought into resonance with the microcavity mode.
In the latest devel- opments, the QDs are embedded in an n-i-p diode [9,12].
Both n-doped GaAs and p-doped GaAs result in free- carrier absorption [13].
To minimize the absorption within the microcavity, the n-doped and p-doped layers are made 2331-7019/21/15(4)/044004(11) 044004-1 Published by the American Physical SocietyDANIEL NAJER et al. PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 15, 044004 (2021) as thin as possible and are positioned close to the node of the vacuum electric ﬁeld.
This technique, positioning an absorbing layer at a node of the vacuum electric ﬁeld, can also be used to reduce losses at the GaAs surface.
But in this case it involves a serious compromise.
If there is a node at the surface, the largest vacuum electric ﬁeld lies in the vacuum gap and not in the GaAs material on account of interferences in the device.
This reduces considerably the coupling of a QD to the vacuum electric ﬁeld.
An accept- ably large coupling is possible only if there is a vacuum ﬁeld antinode at the surface.
Success with n-i-p devices in an open microcavity was possible only after passivation of the surface [9,12].
The role played by the passivation is elucidated here.
We probe the surface-related absorption in an open microcavity.
The main diagnostic tool is a measurement of the wavelength dependence of the Q factor.
With an untreated surface, we ﬁnd that the Q factor is modest, approximately 104 at the stopband (SB) center, much lower than the value expected from the mirror designs.
Following surface passivation, we ﬁnd that the Q factor increases to approximately 106 at the stopband center, close to the value expected from the mirror designs.
This shows, ﬁrst, that the dominant loss mechanism in the untreated case is related to the GaAs surface and, second, that surface passivation remedies this loss.
For the untreated surface, the Q factor has a very strong dependence on wavelength, increasing rapidly on tuning to lower wavelengths.
By comparing the Q factor with the result of model calculations, we ﬁnd that we can account quantitatively for the Q factor by ascribing the loss to absorption in the capping layer, the ﬁnal 55-nm- thick GaAs layer of the heterostructure.
The absorption in the capping layer is an exponential function of the photon energy, pointing to Franz-Keldysh-like absorption induced by a strong electric ﬁeld at the surface [14–18].
In turn, this demonstrates the main role of the surface-passivation layer in this device: it reduces the surface electric ﬁeld, thereby much reducing the Franz-Keldysh absorption.
The stan- dard analytic result for the Franz-Keldysh eﬀect describes the absorption at the unpassivated surface but with an elec- tric ﬁeld much higher than in the standard picture (midgap pinning). II.
THE OPEN, TUNABLE MICROCAVITY The microcavity [7,19] consists of a curved dielec- tric DBR—the template is produced by CO2-laser abla- tion [20]—paired with a “nip-DBR” semiconductor het- erostructure.
InAs QDs are embedded in the intrinsic part of the n-i-p diode; the diode resides on top of a semicon- ductor DBR [Fig. 1(a)].
We use two top dielectric DBRs.
The ﬁrst (DBR I) is composed of 22 pairs of SiO2(λ/4) and Ta2O5(λ/4) (where λ depicts the wavelength in each mate- rial) and is terminated with SiO2; the SB center [21] is at 973 nm.
The second (DBR II) is composed of 15 pairs of 400 300 200 100 0 0 15 30 0 15 30 0 15 30 |Evac| (kV/m) z (nm) + AlAs/GaAs DBR Vg InAs QDs n+ GaAs p++ GaAs Al.33Ga.66As GaAs capping layer X-Y-Z nanopositioner Laser in (a) (b) SiO2/Ta2O5 DBR Photodetector Passivation layer R = 10 µm λC = 920 nm 6.2% MCF = 0.9% 0.9% (c) FIG.

(b) Simulated reﬂectance of the nip-DBR with SB center λC = 920 nm.
(c) Calculated vacuum ﬁeld amplitude across the heterostructure for three diﬀerent wavelengths, −30, 0, and +30 nm with respect to the SB center.
As the antinodes of the vacuum ﬁeld shift in position with wavelength, thereby changing the MCF in the GaAs capping layer, surface-related absorption in the capping layer (10−10–10−8 cm−1) can be probed via the microcavity by our measuring its Q factor across the SB.
At λC, where the coupling to the QDs is maximized, free-carrier absorption in the highly-p-doped and highly-n-doped gates is minimized by our placing them close to a vacuum ﬁeld node.
Note also that the highly reduced vacuum ﬁeld at λ −λC = −30 nm arises because at this wavelength the largest vacuum electric ﬁeld is located in the vacuum gap.
SiO2(λ/4) and Ta2O5(λ/4) and is terminated with Ta2O5; the SB center is at 930 nm.
The semiconductor DBR consists of 46 pairs of AlAs(λ/4) and GaAs(λ/4).
The het- erostructure is a 1.5λ layer of GaAs including doped layers acting as a top gate (p++, 1019 cm−3) and a back gate (n+, 2 × 1018 cm−3).
The QD layer is placed at an antinode of the vacuum electric ﬁeld (at a distance λ below the sur- face).
The intrinsic region between QDs and the back gate acts as tunnel barrier for electrons and ensures that the QDs operate under Coulomb blockade at low temperature [22].
Using a piezoelectric-based X -Y-Z nanopositioner, the microcavity features full in situ tunability at cryogenic temperatures.
A measurement of the Q factor across the SB of the nip-DBR [Fig. 1(b)] reveals possible sources of loss in the heterostructure because the standing wave inside the cav- ity shifts with wavelength [Fig. 1(c)].
For instance, losses 044004-2SURFACE-PASSIVATED GaAs MICROCAVITY PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 15, 044004 (2021) in the capping layer depend on the exact wavelength: at a wavelength detuning of −30, 0, and +30 nm with respect to the nip-DBR’s SB center, the calculated modal conﬁne- ment factor (MCF; deﬁned as the vacuum electromagnetic energy conﬁned in the layer of interest divided by the zero- point energy, ℏω/2, i.e., the total energy of the vacuum ﬁeld mode) of the capping layer is 0.9%, 6.2%, and 0.9%, respectively.
Therefore, if the dominant loss mechanism in the microcavity occurs within the capping layer, then the change in MCF will result in a strong dependence of the Q factor across the stopband.
Furthermore, by careful char- acterization of the mirrors and by simulation of the entire structure with transfer-matrix calculations, measurements of the Q factor not only reveal the location of the domi- nant loss process but can also be used to determine the loss quantitatively. III.
GaAs SURFACE PASSIVATION Surface passivation of GaAs replaces the native oxide with a thin Al2O3 layer [6,23].
The surface-passivation recipe follows in the ﬁrst part of the procedures described in Ref. [24].
As a ﬁrst cleaning step, the processed semi- conductor sample (already containing Au contact pads) is successively immersed in acetone, 2-propanol, and ethanol inside an ultrasonic bath at 40 ◦C. To prevent surface treat- ment of the contact pads, they are covered with a manually applied drop of photoresist (AZ1512HS, Microchemicals GmbH) and baked for 10 min at 100 ◦C. At room tem- perature, the sample is dipped into an HCl solution (25%) for 1 min to remove the native oxide [24,25].
The sam- ple is then rinsed with deionized water for approximately 1 s and immediately immersed in an (NH4)2S solution (20%) for 10 min.
This procedure passivates the sur- face with sulfur [26,27], preventing the native oxide from reforming.
The sulfur layer is, however, not robust.
For this reason, it is removed and replaced with an Al2O3 layer.
To achieve this, on its emerging from the (NH4)2S solution, the sample is blown dry with nitrogen and imme- diately transferred into an atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) chamber (Savannah 100, Cambridge NanoTech Inc.).
The following ALD recipe is chosen to deposit approx- imately 8 nm of Al2O3 onto the sample surface: T = 150 ◦C, ﬁrst pulse 50 ms (water), wait for 12 s, second pulse 40 ms (trimethylaluminium), wait for 10 s; the cycle is repeated 80 times.
The Al2O3 layer acts as a diﬀusion barrier for oxygen [29], thus preventing reoxidation of the etched GaAs surface.
After surface passivation, the remaining challenge is to remove the photoresist that has been cross-linked due to the high temperature, 150 ◦C, inside the ALD cham- ber.
The use of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at elevated temperatures is shown to remove successfully the cross- linked photoresist.
The sample is immersed in NMP for 9–20 h (20 h yields the best result) at 40 ◦C and then suc- cessively cleaned for 5 min in NMP, acetone, 2-propanol, and methanol in an ultrasonic bath at approximately 56 ◦C. As a ﬁnal step, a polymeric strip coating (First Contact, Photonic Cleaning Technologies) is used to remove any ﬁnal residues from the sample surface. IV.
INDIVIDUAL-MIRROR CHARACTERIZATION Each DBR has high reﬂectance for wavelengths within the stopband.
Outside the stopband, there are oscillations in the reﬂectivity as a function of wavelength.
These oscillations are sensitive to the exact layer thicknesses in the particular mirror—this dependence is exploited to characterize the layers in each DBR.
As depicted in Fig. 2, the cavity’s top and bottom mir- rors are characterized at 4.2 K by a broadband light source (white-light-emitting-diode or halogen lamp) and a dark- ﬁeld confocal microscope [28].
The light from the source is coupled into a single-mode optical ﬁber, the output of which is collimated and focused onto the sample surface with an objective lens (NA 0.55).
Cross-polarizing ele- ments are used in the beam path to reject all but the light reﬂected from the sample surface.
The detection ﬁber is connected to a spectrometer [28].
The reﬂected light from a metallic mirror, the Au contact pad in the case of the nip-DBR, is used to record a reference spectrum.
The nip- DBR’s reﬂectance spectrum is obtained by dividing its reﬂected spectrum by the reference spectrum.
Because of the absence of a metallic reference surface on top of dielec- tric DBR I in Fig. 2(a) , an exponential ﬁt of the reference spectrum from Fig. 2(b) is used instead, and the maximum reﬂectance is normalized to 1.
Via one-dimensional (1D) transfer-matrix methods (ESSENTIAL MACLEOD, Thin Film Center Inc.) the design layer thicknesses can be reﬁned to ﬁt the reﬂectivity oscil- lations outside the stopband.
The models obtained for each DBR (solid red lines in Fig. 2) provide a convincing description of these oscillations.
These mirror descriptions are then used to simulate the cavity performance, in par- ticular the Q factors and transmittance values at resonance as a function of the vacuum gap between the mirrors (see Sec. IX).
The slight discrepancy between experiment and the model arises from the diﬃculty of recording precisely a reference spectrum for the white-light source.
V. MICROCAVITY CHARACTERIZATION: Q FACTORS A microcavity is constructed with use of passivated and unpassivated semiconductor DBRs and a curved dielectric DBR (radius of curvature approximately 7–16 μm) similar to the ones characterized in Fig. 2.
Via narrowband-laser transmission measurements , each microcavity is character- ized by our determining its Q factor across the SB of the semiconductor DBR.
The transmission signal is measured 044004-3DANIEL NAJER et al. PHYS. REV.

2. Mirror characterization via reﬂection measurements.
Each mirror is investigated by our recording the spectrum of white light reﬂected oﬀthe sample using a dark-ﬁeld confocal microscope [28].
Via 1D transfer-matrix methods (ESSENTIAL MACLEOD), the designed layer thicknesses can be reﬁned to ﬁt the experimentally observed oscillations.

The reﬂected signal is recorded on a ﬂat surface away from the curved part of the mirror and normalized by the white-light spec- trum.

as a function of laser frequency with our keeping the cavity length ﬁxed [Fig. 3(a)].
To change the cavity’s resonance frequency, the mirror separation is changed by means of the Z nanopositioner.
A Q factor is obtained for every pair of longitudi- nal (TEM00) modes at the minimum mirror separation (approximately 2–4 μm, depending on the wavelength and mirror-crater depth [19]) by our ﬁtting a double Lorentzian.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the results for an electrically contacted passivated sample (black dots), an electrically uncontacted unpassivated sample (blue trian- gles), and an electrically contacted unpassivated sample (red squares), paired with DBR I as the top mirror [30].
Without passivation, the Q factor is around 105 for the electrically uncontacted unpassivated sample at the SB center, and is too low to measure precisely for the elec- trically contacted unpassivated sample.

Mean values and standard deviations originate from data from two cavity modes and up to six measurements.
Two surface-loss mechanisms are mod- eled: absorption and scattering.
The solid lines are calculated Q factors with our taking into account free-carrier absorption (absorption coeﬃcients from Ref.
[13]) and Franz-Keldysh (FK) absorption [17,18] for electric ﬁelds in the capping layer Fcap = (200, 320, 470) kV/cm.
The dotted lines are calculated by our taking into account surface scattering only [31].
For the pas- sivated case, the dotted black line is modeled with roughness at both the GaAs-alumina interface and the alumina-vacuum interface σ = (σGaAs-Al2O3, σAl2O3-vac), and is found to be σ = (0.14, 0.14) nm; alternatively σ = (0.0, 0.55) nm yields similar results.
In the unpassivated cases, the dotted blue and red lines are modeled with σGaAs-vac = 0.5 nm and σGaAs-vac = 1.0 nm at the GaAs-vacuum interface, respectively.
The solid gray line is the model without any surface losses.
(c) By comparing mea- sured and simulated Q factors, and assuming that the scattering losses are negligible, one can deduce the absorption coeﬃcient α as a function of photoenergy.
α is ﬁtted to the Franz-Keldysh result with Fcap as a ﬁtting parameter.
044004-4SURFACE-PASSIVATED GaAs MICROCAVITY PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 15, 044004 (2021) 10 nm from the SB center, the Q factor is on average 3.8 × 104 for the electrically contacted unpassivated sam- ple and 1.28 × 105 for the electrically uncontacted unpas- sivated sample [Fig. 3(a)].
These values are much smaller than the values expected from the DBRs—they signify that there is a signiﬁcant loss mechanism.
Around the SB center, where the coupling to the QD layer is maximized (λC = 915–925 nm), the Q factors are strongly decreased by this loss mechanism—the loss impacts signiﬁcantly the performance of a QD in the microcavity.
As the wavelength approaches the red end of the SB, the Q factors for the unpassivated samples increase.
There is a pronounced asymmetry with respect to the SB center: the Q factors decrease monotonically as the wavelength shifts to the blue with respect to the SB center.
These results imply that the loss mechanism is a strong function of wavelength.
After passivation, the Q factor around the SB center increases.
At a redshift of 10 nm from the SB center, the Q factor increases to a very large value, 6.34 × 105 [Fig. 3(a)].
Furthermore, the dependence of the Q factor on wavelength is much more symmetric with respect to the SB center.
The decrease on the blue side reﬂects the decrease in reﬂectivity of the dielectric mirror, which, for fabrica- tion reasons, has a maximum reﬂectivity at a wavelength of 973 nm.
The passivation procedure changes the properties of the surface but leaves the rest of the microcavity unchanged.
The drastic increase of the Q factors after surface pas- sivation leads therefore to the conclusion that the losses limiting the Q factors of unpassivated microcavities are related to the semiconductor surface.
Speciﬁcally, the loss, either an absorption or a scattering mechanism, originates at the GaAs surface itself or in the GaAs layer immediately below the surface.
These results are veriﬁed in a second experiment using a diﬀerent piece of wafer material from the nip-DBR.
The passivation is performed in a separate run; the cavity is constructed with DBR II as the top mirror.
The results are shown in Fig. 4.
The results follow closely those of the ﬁrst experiment, with the advantage that the Q factors can be determined also on the blue side of the SB center.
To quantify the loss, the entire microcavity is modeled (see Sec. IX) using accurate descriptions of the two DBRs, including the free-carrier absorption in the doped layers in the heterostructure.
Absorption is added to the capping layer (GaAs between the p doping and the surface) and adjusted to match the experimentally determined Q fac- tors at each wavelength.
This is a robust procedure as the surface-related loss dominates other loss channels.
The extracted absorption coeﬃcients α from this procedure are plotted as a function of wavelength in Fig. 3(c).
In both cases shown in Fig. 3(c) the absorption coeﬃ- cients α are extremely small.

4. Determination of surface-related losses via Q-factor measurements using DBR II with a nip-DBR.
We probe the double role of surface passivation.
Four positions in the con- tacted sample are probed: three passivated areas, A, B, and C (circles), and an unpassivated region (red squares).
Mean val- ues and standard deviation result from the measurements on the two cavity modes.
We implement a mixed model to ﬁt the data: Franz-Keldysh-like absorption and reasonable values of surface roughness are probed together.
For the passivated regions, sur- face roughness alone explains the observed data.
We estimate a roughness σ = (σGaAs-Al2O3, σAl2O3-vac) for each region: at region A σ = (0.5, 0.5) nm, alternatively σ = (0.0, 1.0) nm; at region B σ = (0.25, 0.8) nm, alternatively σ = (0.0, 1.4) nm; at region C σ = (0.5, 3.0) nm, alternatively σ = (0.0, 3.75) nm.
For the unpassivated region, surface roughness alone cannot account for the Q-factor dependence on wavelength alone: with a surface roughness of σGaAs-vac = 0.3 nm, an electric ﬁeld Fcap = 400 kV/cm is still needed to ﬁt the data.
for detecting very weak absorption or scattering events.
In a single-pass experiment, these losses would be very diﬃcult to detect.
Signiﬁcantly, we ﬁnd that α depends exponentially on photon energy in the unpassivated case, a dependence that rules out scattering or broadband absorp- tion as the main loss mechanism at the surface, as these processes would have a much weaker dependence on wavelength.
Instead, the exponential dependence points to below-gap absorption in an electric ﬁeld. VI.
INVESTIGATION OF LOSS VIA SURFACE ROUGHNESS To conﬁrm that the measured losses on the heterostruc- ture with doping are indeed a consequence of the doped layers and to quantify losses via surface scattering, we compare our results with those for a microcavity consist- ing of a semiconductor heterostructure without doping.
The heterostructure in this case is a λ layer of GaAs 044004-5DANIEL NAJER et al. PHYS. REV.

Undoped semiconductor heterostructure: reﬂectance and Q-factor measurements.
(a) Reﬂectance measurement of a semiconductor heterostructure without doping (λC = 956 nm) at 4.2 K. The heterostructure contains a λ layer of GaAs on top of 33 pairs of AlAs(λ/4)/GaAs(λ/4).
A layer of QDs is included at the center of the GaAs layer.
To record a reference spectrum, parts of the sample are covered by a Au ﬁlm by means of electron-beam evaporation.
(b) Q factor of a microcavity at 4.2 K consisting of this heterostructure without doping paired with dielectric top mirror DBR I: experimental results (circles) and simulation with surface roughness σGaAs-vac = 0.5 nm (solid red line).
The dotted red line is the expected Q factor upon passivation of the surface with a 8.0-nm-thick Al2O3 layer.
The solid gray line corresponds to expected Q factor without any surface losses.
(with embedded InAs QDs in the center) on top of a 33- pair AlAs/GaAs DBR [7,8,32].
It is a high-quality sample but may not match the ultrahigh quality of the semicon- ductor heterostructure with doping.
Initially, we repeat the mirror-characterization procedure described above and ﬁnd a suitable model for the semiconductor layer thick- nesses [Fig. 5(a)].
Subsequently, we pair this mirror with dielectric top mirror DBR I. Figure 5(b) depicts the measured Q factors as a func- tion of wavelength for the semiconductor heterostructure without doping.
The Q factor reaches approximately 105 at the stopband center, and remains constant within mea- surement error over a wavelength range of approximately 20 nm.
This behavior is quite diﬀerent from that of the unpassivated semiconductor heterostructure with doping [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) and 4].
The conclusion is that the strongly-wavelength-dependent loss process is related to the doping.
In the absence of losses, the heterostructure-without- doping-top-mirror combination should yield a Q factor of 2 × 105 in the stopband center [Fig. 5(b)], solid gray line], about a factor of 2 higher than that determined experimen- tally [Fig. 5(b), black circles].
The wavelength dependence of the Q factor [Fig. 5(b)] is, as before, a useful diagnostic of the scattering process.
We ﬁnd that in this case scat- tering alone at the GaAs-vacuum interface can account for the measured Q factors, with surface roughness σGaAs-vac = 0.5 nm [Fig. 5(b), solid red line].
We simulate as well the possible outcome of passivating the undoped sample, with σ = (σGaAs-Al2O3, σAl2O3-vac) = (0.5, 0.5) nm, shown in Fig. 5(b) as the dotted red line: the addition of a thin alu- mina layer would diminish the eﬀect of surface scattering due to surface roughness, increasing slightly the expected Q factor.
A surface roughness σ translates into a total inte- grated scatter of approximately (4πσ/λ)2 [33], and can be modeled by an extinction coeﬃcient k (for the 1D transfer-matrix methods) according to Ref.
[31], k = π(n1 −n2)2(n1 + n2)d λ  8(n2 1 + n2 2) , (1) where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two layers surrounding the scattering layer of thickness d = 2σ, and λ is the free-space wavelength.
Including this loss in the simulations reproduces the measured Q fac- tors convincingly.
Furthermore, atomic-force-microscopy (AFM) measurements (tapping mode, Bruker Dimension 3100) indicate that surface roughness is present in dif- ferent amounts across the samples, as shown in Fig. 6.
The undoped wafer has root-mean-square surface rough- ness 0.3 nm ≤σ ≤0.7 nm, the unpassivated bare sample (without contacts) has 0.2 nm ≤σ ≤0.9 nm, the unpassi- vated contacted sample has 0.4 nm ≤σ ≤7.3 nm, and the passivated sample has 0.3 nm ≤σ ≤1.9 nm.
The native surface roughness at the GaAs-vacuum interface, imme- diately after growth of the samples, is on the order of 0.15–0.30 nm.
However, increased roughness is caused by processing of the samples (e.g., via passivation, clean- ing and gluing, and bonding).
We speculate that in the unpassivated contacted samples, the high values of surface roughness might be induced by remnant traces of photore- sist from the processing procedure (which in turn have a lower scattering power than pure GaAs, due to the reduced refractive index).
The passivated doped sample also provides an opportu- nity to test the applicability of the total integrated scatter result for loss at a rough interface.

Diﬀerent sample locations exhibited surface roughness in the range 0.2 nm ≤σ ≤0.9 nm.
in contrast to the results in the unpassivated region.
The model with σ = (0.5, 0.5) nm, σ = (0.25, 0.8) nm, and σ = (0.5, 3.0) nm for regions A, B, and C, respectively, reproduces these Q factors precisely, with reasonable val- ues of roughness at each interface (Fig. 4).
Furthermore, the model captures the symmetric inﬂuence of roughness on the Q factor with respect to the SB center.
This results from the reduction in the MCF at the sample’s surface, as presented in Fig. 1(c).
Agreement between the Q factors and the simulation gives us conﬁdence that the description of loss via surface scattering is quantitatively correct.
The conclusion from this measurement and analysis is that passivation of the surface not only quenches surface- related absorption but also has the beneﬁcial eﬀect of reducing loss via surface scattering.
The original GaAs surface and the passivated surface have a similar range of values of surface roughness.
In the passivated case, the sur- face loss via scattering is about 60% with respect to that of the unpassivated sample.
The passivation procedure cre- ates a layer with an intermediate refractive index: it avoids the large jump in refractive index at a GaAs-vacuum interface.
This reduces the total scattering loss.
In the case of the doped unpassivated sample, the wave- length dependence of the Q factors is too strong to be accounted for by scattering loss [Figs. 3(b) and 4].
A diﬀerent mechanism is clearly at play. VII.
MICROSCOPIC EXPLANATION FOR THE NIP-DBR LOSSES We give a possible microscopic explanation for the losses in the investigated nip-DBR structure and why sur- face passivation signiﬁcantly reduces them.
In Fig. 7(a), the calculated valence-band and conduction-band edges in the heterostructure are shown, a solution to the 1D Poisson equation (obtained via nextnano software, nextnanomat, nextnano GmbH).
In the unpassivated case, we simulate the midgap Fermi-level pinning at the surface via a Schot- tky barrier of 0.76 eV. This yields an electric ﬁeld in the capping layer (“capping ﬁeld”) Fcap of 140 kV/cm.
An electric ﬁeld in a semiconductor leads to Franz- Keldysh absorption below the band gap of the material [14,15]: owing to the position dependence of the band edges, the electron and hole wave functions can be described by Airy functions (similar to a particle in a trian- gular well [34]) and acquire an exponential tail at energies within the band gap.
The electric ﬁeld therefore creates an absorption processes at photon energies Ephoton < Eg.
The situation is schematically depicted in Fig. 7(b).
According to the standard model [16], Franz-Keldysh absorption at photon energy E due to the presence of an electric ﬁeld F can be described via the absorption coeﬃcient: α(E, F) = β F1/3 E  i=lh,hh  μi m0 4/3 |Mi|2 ×  |Ai′(xi)|2 −xi|Ai(xi)|2 , (2) where xi = e  Eg −E 	 ℏθi (3) and ℏθi = (eFℏ)2 2μi 1/3 .

7. Band structure and Franz-Keldysh eﬀect.
(a) Simulation of the conduction and valence bands in the n-i-p diode (nextnanomat) at 4.2 K.
The surface is modeled via a Schottky barrier of Eg/2 = 0.76 eV reﬂecting the midgap Fermi-level pin- ning at the GaAs surface [24].
The eﬀect of surface passivation is to eliminate the electric ﬁeld at the capping layer.
(b) Schematic of the Franz-Keldysh eﬀect [14,15].
An electric ﬁeld applied to a semiconductor allows both electrons and holes to tunnel into the forbidden energy, leading to below-gap absorption processes.

The solid lines correspond to the calculated absorption coeﬃcients according to Refs.
[16,17] [Eqs. (2)–(6)].
reduced Planck constant (in SI units), m0 is the free electron rest mass (in kilograms), μlh = 0.037m0 (μhh = 0.058m0) is the reduced mass of an electron–light-hole pair (electron–heavy-hole pair), F is given in kilovolts per cen- timeter, the energies Eg and E are given in electronvolts, and |Mlh|2 (|Mhh|2) the momentum matrix elements for the light-hole (heavy-hole).
Ai(xi) is an Airy function [35].
We use of the momentum matrix elements derived in Ref.
[17] for diﬀerent polarizations of the radiation ﬁeld.
For light polarized in the x-y plane, the momentum matrix elements for the light and heavy holes read |Mlh|2 = P2/3, (5) |Mhh|2 = P2, (6) where P = 0.692 (arbitrary units) is a typical value for GaAs [17].
We use this model for Franz-Keldysh absorption to describe previously reported room-temperature experi- ments on a p-i-n double heterostructure [18] [Fig. 7(c)], and extract the value of β in Eq. (2), which is found to be 2.5 × 104 (arbitrary units).
These experiments extend to photon energies far below the band gap, the case of inter- est here.
There is a compelling overlap between theory and experiment.
To estimate Franz-Keldysh absorption coeﬃcients in our nip-DBR at 4.2 K [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) and 4], we use Eqs.
(2)–(6), taking the low-temperature GaAs band gap of 1.519 eV and β extracted from ﬁtting the data in Fig. 7(c).
We compare the results of the model for low-temperature Franz-Keldysh absorption with the experimental data pre- sented in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), taking the electric ﬁeld F as a ﬁtting parameter.
The exponential dependence of the absorption on the photon energy is well described by Franz-Keldysh absorption.
However, in the unpassivated case, the capping ﬁeld Fcap = 470 kV/cm when we do not account for any surface roughness (Fig. 3) and Fcap = 400 kV/cm when we account for a realistic value of surface roughness (Fig. 4).
These values are, respectively 3.4 and 2.8 times greater than the values expected from the 1D Poisson equation [Fig. 7(a)].
The origin of this discrep- ancy is not understood at this time, but we note several points.
First, there are no Franz-Keldysh-absorption experi- ments reported in the literature at low temperature (4.2 K) and at photon energies far below the band gap Eg of GaAs (at E −Eg ∼−0.17 eV, corresponding to λ ∼920 nm).
Our approach here is to ﬁt the theory presented in Refs.
[16,17] to the room-temperature experimental results reported in Ref.
[18] [Fig. 7(c)] and then to extrapolate the absorption coeﬃcients to photon energies approximately 0.17 eV below the band gap.
The change in temperature, from room temperature to low temperature, is accommo- dated by a rigid shift in the absorption spectrum to account for the increase in the band gap.
It is conceivable that the standard Franz-Keldysh theory is inadequate at photon energies far below the band gap—this point has not been tested experimentally.
044004-8SURFACE-PASSIVATED GaAs MICROCAVITY PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 15, 044004 (2021) Secondly, there are room-temperature experiments on Franz-Keldysh oscillations in doped GaAs heterostructures (a 25–80-nm-thick, undoped GaAs capping layer on top of an n+-doped Al0.32Ga0.68As layer [36]) that also report sur- face electric ﬁeld values a factor 1.8–3.8 greater than the expected ones [37].
Thirdly, the Franz-Keldysh model describes a bulk semiconductor in a uniform electric ﬁeld.
Obviously, it does not take into account the microscopic details of the surface; for instance, surface reconstructions and oxida- tion.
It is possible that the details of the surface layer are important here.
In the light of this analysis, our proposal is that surface passivation quenches surface-related absorption primar- ily by reducing the electric ﬁeld in the capping layer, thereby eliminating the Franz-Keldysh absorption (within the sensitivity of the experiment).
A remaining question is why the bare-wafer sample without passivation shows higher Q factors than the elec- trically contacted sample also without passivation [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)].
The contacting process may change the sur- face roughness, as revealed by the AFM measurements (Fig. 6).
The surface roughness per se does not, how- ever, account for the Q factors of the various samples.
The main point is that surface scattering does not account for the exponential dependence of the loss process on photon energy [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)].
Instead, we speculate that the change in GaAs surface on forming the contacts results in a change of surface pinning, thereby increasing the capping ﬁeld.
One possibility is that the degradation of the surface on contacting spreads the available surface states to lower energies. VIII.
MODEL FOR THE CURVED DIELECTRIC MIRRORS An interpretation of the microcavity Q factors in terms of losses in the semiconductor heterostructure rests on an understanding of the top mirror.
The top mirrors, dielec- tric DBRs, are of very high quality with very low loss.
To prove this point, we investigate a microcavity formed from DBR I and a planar version of DBR I.
The coatings for the plane mirror and concave mirrors are applied to the sub- strates in the same run and are nominally identical.
Figure 8 shows the measured Q factors.
At the stopband center of the top mirror (λC = 976 nm), the Q factor is extremely high, 1.5 × 106.
To describe the dielectric mirror accu- rately at the stopband center of the semiconductor DBR, we analyze the dependence of the dielectric-dielectric Q factor and transmission as a function of wavelength.
To describe the high transmission at short wavelengths, we are forced to shift the stopband center of the bottom mir- ror by 3 nm to the red [38].

Measured Q factors and cavity transmittance of a purely dielectric microcavity.
A dielectric top mirror (λC = 973 nm) paired with a dielectric bottom mirror (shifted to λC = 976 nm, nominally the same coating) at 300 K. The cavity trans- mittance is measured by our relating the transmitted power at the cavity resonance to the laser power before the objective lens multiplied by a ﬁtted in-coupling eﬃciency of 59%.
The solid black line (dashed red line) corresponds to the calculated Q factor (cavity transmittance) with our taking into account mate- rial extinction coeﬃcients kSiO2 = 4 × 10−7 and kTa2O5 = 4.5 × 10−7 [39].
Additionally, an interface roughness of σ = 0.25 nm above each of the ﬁve-last-grown Ta2O5 layers and k = 4kTa2O5 in the last-grown Ta2O5 layer are introduced heuristically to ﬁt the experimental data.
in Fig. 1 (extinction coeﬃcients corresponding to an inter- face roughness of 0.25 nm [31]) and increased absorption within the “lowest” Ta2O5 layer (extinction coeﬃcient k = 4kTa2O5, where kTa2O5 is deﬁned in Sec. IX) are heuristically introduced in the model so as to describe the measured Q factors.
This ﬁt is very convincing (Fig. 8).
This descrip- tion of dielectric top mirror DBR I is used to interpret the measurements on microcavities formed with the semicon- ductor DBRs as the bottom mirror [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) and 5(b)]. IX.
1D TRANSFER-MATRIX CALCULATION OF THE MICROCAVITYQ FACTORS We list the relevant parameters used for the Q-factor calculations via a one-dimensional transfer-matrix method.
The extinction coeﬃcients in the diﬀerent materials are as follows.
For DBR I, kSiO2 = 4 × 10−7 [39], kTa2O5 = 4.5 × 10−7 [39], and k = 4kTa2O5 is used for the “low- est” (i.e., the last-grown) Ta2O5 layer (the layer closest to the vacuum gap).
For DBR II, kSiO2 = 4 × 10−6 and kTa2O5 = 4.5 × 10−6 (from ﬁtting data taken with curved DBR II and planar DBR I microcavity).
For the semi- conductor nip-DBR, kp++ = 5.2 × 10−4 for p++-doped GaAs, kp+ = 1.9 × 10−4 for p+-doped GaAs, and kn+ = 0.7 × 10−4 for n+-doped GaAs [13].
An extinction coef- ﬁcient of k = αFKλ/(4π), where αFK is a Franz-Keldysh absorption coeﬃcient, is introduced in the capping layer; αFK depends on the electric ﬁeld.
Surface roughness is 044004-9DANIEL NAJER et al. PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 15, 044004 (2021) described by our introducing an additional layer of thick- ness d = 2σ, where σ is the root-mean-square surface or interface roughness [31].
In analogy to the experiment, a Q factor is determined for a ﬁxed “vacuum-gap” layer thickness by our calculat- ing a cavity transmittance spectrum.
A Lorentzian ﬁt to the calculated spectrum is used to determine the resonance fre- quency as well as the Q factor.
This procedure is repeated for diﬀerent vacuum gaps, yielding a plot of Q factor ver- sus wavelength.
The resulting Q factors are presented in Figs. 3–5 and 8.
X. CONCLUSION Signiﬁcant surface-related losses in an open microcav- ity consisting of a nip-DBR and a dielectric DBR are much reduced by passivation of the GaAs surface.
The passivation works primarily by eliminating the Franz- Keldysh-like absorption in the capping layer.
A secondary beneﬁt of the passivation is to reduce loss by surface scat- tering.
With passivation, Q factors close to 106 can be achieved.
