Following Tomita and Murakami (Research of Pattern Formation  ed R Takaki (Tokyo: KTK Scientiﬁc Publishers) pp 197–203) we propose an  analytical model to predict the critical probability of percolation.
It is based  on the excursion set theory which allows us to consider N-dimensional bounded  regions.
Details are given for the three-dimensional (3D) case and statistically  representative volume elements are calculated.
Finally, generalisation to the  N-dimensional case is made.

Introduction The mass transfer properties of randomly distributed porous media are of major inter- est since they are involved in countless applications.
Derived from chemistry [5] but  ﬁrst expressed by [3] as a statistical-geometry model, percolation on random stochastic  patterns was used to study a ﬂuid ﬂow through a rock assumed to be a network of  channels, randomly open or close.
These problems are often treated through a lattice  discretisation of space and a set of arbitrary rules (often referred to as bond or site  percolation) in order to deﬁne an inﬁnite cluster, which are paths for the mass transfer.
Here the quantity of interest is the critical (or percolation) probability pc that deﬁnes,  according to a statistical point of view, whether an inﬁnite cluster exists or not.
For materials science, considering inﬁnite size domains as well as inﬁnite clusters  is not the most convenient.
In percolation theory, classical upscaling procedures use,  for example, cluster statistics to overcome this limitation [11].
Following [30] and  extending it to bounded regions in space, we propose using excursion sets of correlated  Random Fields (hereafter noted RFs) and their underlying predictable properties [2] in  order to tackle this problem by means of topology quantiﬁcation via the Euler charac- teristic (or Euler number, and hereafter noted EC).
The concepts of percolation and topological quantiﬁcation are intrinsically dierent.
The former raises the question of the existence of a percolating cluster of the size of  the system, whereas the latter is a measure of the connectivity.
However, without  exactly knowing why, it has been observed many times in the continuum case that  the topological information carried by the EC is linked to percolation ([14, 15, 18]),  the critical behaviour taking place when it changes sign.

(2016) 033306 systems such as lattices, dierences can occur between the critical probability pre- dicted with percolation theory and its topological estimation [16, 17].
In addition, the  present work investigates ﬁnite systems for which the phenomenon is less understood.
Thus, to avoid confusion, it is knowingly assumed by the authors that, in the present  context, the topological measure predicts percolation.
Analysis of the link between both  is beyond the scope of this article, but it is the authors’ point of view that the strong  similitudes between their results and known percolation probabilities (namely pc  =  1/2  in two dimensions (2D) [27] and p 0.16 c ≈  in three dimensions (3D) [23]) justify further  investigations with, for example, Monte-Carlo numerical simulations.
Hence, a relation can be made between excursion sets and the percolation probabil- ity, using a theoretical framework.
In the early 1990s this was highlighted by [30] and  [19], and they deduced a critical volume fraction for inﬁnite size problems analytically.
We propose following the same path adding some bound corrections introduced by [32],  aptly representing ﬁnite size domains.
To the authors’ knowledge, no analytical solu- tion is known for these problems, leading to an expensive need for numerical resources  when trying to evaluate percolation probability.
The outline of this paper is as follows: section 2 presents the essential ingredients  we use in terms of RFs and excursion sets.
The attention is drawn to the expectation  of the EC.
Section  3 then turns to the evaluation of percolation probabilities over  bounded regions in three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space.
Section 4 shows how these  results may lead to a new deﬁnition of the so-called representative volume element  (RVE), which is a major concept dealing with heterogeneous materials.
Finally, sec- tion 5 extends our result on critical probabilities for N-dimensional space.
2. Measures of excursion sets Excursion sets are the results of a thresholding operation on a correlated RF.
In the  present three-dimensional case, if g M : 3 ⊂  R R is such a ﬁeld then, for a given  threshold κ ∈R, the excursion set is deﬁned by: κ = ∈ ⊂ | > x x E M g .
s 3 R {     ( ) }  (1) Obviously, the morphology of the excursion strongly depends on the properties of  the underlying RF (marginal distribution, covariance function, ) and the value of the  threshold (see ﬁgure 1).
However, a probabilistic link between these parameters and the  morphological characteristics of the excursion is established [1, 2].
Among the dierent  measures that can deﬁne a given morphology [13], here attention is drawn to the vol- ume fraction Φ, which is a geometrical measure, and the EC χ which is a topological  one.
Obviously Φ and χ are Random Variables.
Thus, the link we invoke is a probabi- listic one, giving the expected values ( { } • E ) of the two measures as a function of the  excursion parameters.
Two important aspects are worth noting.
First, the excursion set theory provides  the model with a control of the morphologies through the analytical knowledge of the  measure’s probability.
Second, by its predictable aspect, this theory avoids the need  for any actual realisation of the random morphologies and the numerical resources that  it implies.

(2016) 033306 EC is used here to detect percolation when it changes sign (null values) [19].
From  [2], its expected values are known (see equation (2)).
For a Gaussian RF  0, 2 N ( ) σ  of  Gaussian covariance function and correlation length lc and deﬁned over a cube M of  size l is given by: F 2 1 3 2 3 2 e / , 3 2 2 2 2 3/2 /2 2 2 { } ( ) ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ χ β π κ σ β π κ σ β π κ σ = − + + + κ σ − E (2) where  l l/ c β =  is a length ratio, κ is the threshold of equation  (1), σ the standard  deviation of the normal distribution and F x t : e d , x t 1 2 ∫ π ∞ −   its tail probability.
Full  details of the derivation of equation (2) are given by the authors in [22].
It is worth  noting that the asymptotic behaviour  → β ∞, which corresponds to inﬁnite domains,  lets equation (2) with a single term that remains proportional to the volume times  1 e 2 2 ( ) κ − κ − (for unit variance).
This term, introduced by Robert Adler in 1976, is the  result of dierential topology where excursions could not touch the boundaries.
Later,  applying the Integral geometry’s Kinematic Fundamental Formula on excursions,  Keith Worsley was able to add the three other terms (see [32] for details).
These terms  are the so-called bound corrections which allow us to consider ﬁnite size problems.
Volume fraction plays directly the role of the critical volume of percolation c Φ and  thus the critical probability pc.
Indeed, due to the deﬁnition of excursion sets of equa- tion (1), it is rather straightforward that its expected value is simply the tail probability: F / . { } ( ) κ σ Φ = E (3) The simple aspect of equation (3) comes from the absence of spatial information  in the measure of volume fractions.
As a function of the threshold, Φ is monotonically  increasing.
From 1 for inﬁnity large negative κ to 0 for inﬁnitely large positive ones.
However, the behaviour of the EC equation (2) is rather more complicated.
The next  section explains this along with the link to percolation phenomena.
More detail on the  excursion set theory is beyond the scope of the article.
As mentionned in [1, 2], it has  to be kept in mind that this equation still holds for: Figure 1.  Excursion sets of a Gaussian RF.

Interested read- ers can consult [21, 22].
The authors would like to emphasise the very similar aspect of equations (2) and (3)  with known results on the expected values of Minkowski functionals of Boolean models  for inﬁnite [14] and ﬁnite [24] domains.
3. Percolation criterion The link between percolation and the EC is considered when, for variations of the  threshold, the EC switches signs [14].
As depicted in ﬁgure (2), where the expected  value of the EC of equation (2) is plotted as a function of the threshold value κ for  three dierent length ratios β, most of the time it occurs two times and represents two  dierent percolation states.
The two roots of { ( )} χ κ E  equation (2) noted c κ+ and c κ− correspond to the following  situations: Percolation of the excursion at  0 c { ( )} χ κ = + E By considering a high threshold  value, the corresponding excursion set is made of small disconnected components.
As the threshold value decreases, these components grow and others appear, making  the EC increase to a certain maximum point.
It corresponds to the coalescence of  the biggest components.
The critical point of interest c κ+ is for a threshold value  just below the latter states, where the χ is null.
It is stated that at this stage, the  excursion set is percolated.
Percolation of the voids  0 c { ( )} χ κ = − E The same reasoning can be made in order  to define the other percolation point.
This time, increasing thresholds starting at  a very low value has to be considered.
The percolation point c κ− is also for the first  null value of the EC and corresponds to the percolation of the voids.
It can be noted in ﬁgure 2 that, for some values of β, percolation cannot be deﬁned  ( 2 β =  for example).
Since the EC is always positive, the volumes considered are too  small to bring any relevant statistical information in terms of percolation states.
This  observation can naturally be understood by considering the asymptotic case  0 → β ,  where equation (2) simply becomes the tail probability F  of the underlying distribu- tion.
In this speciﬁc case, correlation is inﬁnite compared to domain size, meaning that  the RF is constant leading to excursions without any other topological meaning than  being completely full  1 χ =  or completely empty  0 χ = .
This explains why the fraction  volume and the EC are equivalent.
Increasing β brings back the spatial structure of the  correlated RF (and with it the dierentiation between the fraction volume and EC) until  the volume is representative enough to have critical behaviour, e.g. null values of χ.
Attention is now drawn to the corresponding critical volume for percolation:Critical probability of percolation over bounded region in N-dimensional Euclidean space 6 doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2016/03/033306 J. Stat. Mech. (2016) 033306 and .
c c c c { ( )}      { ( )} κ κ Φ = Φ Φ = Φ + + − − E E  (4) Even if not taken into account in the notation, the critical volumes of equation (4)  have to be considered as expected values.
Figure (3) shows them both as a function of  the length ratio β.
It can be seen that a frontier is created between two states, one with positive val- ues of χ (outside) and the other with negative values (inside).
As the topology of an  excursion can be determined whether it is inside or outside, this graph can be seen as  a ﬁnite size approximation of a phase diagram.
The fact that the two curves go away  Figure 2.  Expected values of the ECs as a function of the threshold value κ  for dierent length ratios β for the Gaussian RF with the Gaussian covariance  function.

(2016) 033306 from their asymptotic values and ﬁnally meet is a direct representation of side eects  analytically taken into account by the bound corrections present in equation (2) [32].
It is this feature that grants the model the possibility of predicting percolation over  bounded regions.
The asymptotic values in ﬁgure 3 can easily be calculated.
Indeed, when → β ∞, the  two roots of equation (3) are c κ σ = +  and c κ σ = − − .
Injecting them into equation (3) the  two critical volumes: F lim 1 0.1584 c ( ) → Φ = = … β ∞ +  (5) and F lim 1 0.8413 c ( ) → Φ = − = … β ∞ −  (6) Furthermore, from the properties of the tail probability function in this case, the  symmetry between the void and excursion percolation is proven by the fact that: lim 1 lim .
c c → → Φ = − Φ β β ∞ + ∞ −  (7) These results are consistent with some values from the literature obtained ﬁrst by  computer simulations of the potential model (0.17 0.01 ±  in [25]) or by speculation on  lattice problems (0.16 0.02 ±  in [34]).
They are also consistent with the symmetrical  assumption  1 c c Φ + Φ = + − .
However, based on numerical simulations [6, 20] or analytical  approximations [33], three-dimensional continuum models are often based on overlap- ping ideal geometrical objects (sphere, ellipsoids, squares,...) leading to a signiﬁcant  variation of the results (see [35] for a more in-depth analysis).
Now, still in ﬁgure 3, as β decreases, the critical volume fraction of the excursion  set c Φ+ increases.
It agrees with remarks made in [20] stating that simulations in larger  domains lead to smaller results.
This rather unintuitive feature can be interpreted by  the fact that, in a ﬁnite size domain, there are fewer possible paths to link two distant  points than in an inﬁnite one.
Hence, a higher volume fraction is needed.
Table 1 shows  some approximations of  c Φ+ and  c Φ−.
First, it can be observed that the present prediction model possesses a limitation  for small scales ( lim β β <  with  2.7766 lim β ≈  see table 1), where no percolation can be  deﬁned.
As mentioned in the previous section, it corresponds to an absence of root in  the EC function.
Then, table 1 shows that for ﬁnite size domains we observe the loss of  the symmetrical relationship 1 c c ⩾ Φ + Φ + − , meaning that the symmetry hypothesis (that  exists on inﬁnite size problems) does not apply anymore.
Finally, when looking at the  Table 1.  Critical volumes of percolation of excursion sets of the Gaussian RF with  the Gaussian covariance function for speciﬁc scale ratios.

(2016) 033306 variation of the critical volumes as a function of the scales, it can be seen that the side  eects play a signiﬁcant role for rather small scales.
Actually, as a ﬁrst part of the next  section, a quantiﬁcation of the contribution of side eects leads to the deﬁnition of the  morphological RVE for percolation.
Then an extension of the predictive model is made  for N-dimensional spaces.
4. Possible extensions 4.1.
Percolation representative volume elements Dealing with heterogeneous media, traditional approaches to deﬁning the RVE are  based on a set of realisations and an averaging procedure.
Theoretically, if the domain  M is an RVE for a given property, the discrepancy of the results must vanish to zero.
However, these RVEs are usually too large to be handled numerically.
Smaller realisa- tions are thus made and from average values over all the realisations, lower and upper  bounds can be deﬁned [9, 10].
Herein, this statistical approach is embedded in the  theoretical framework that gives the excursion set expected characteristics.
Hence, no  actual realisation is computed.
Due to its monotonic shape, the RVE is deﬁned with regard to the critical volumes  of percolation of the excursion set (now noted c Φ instead of  c Φ+) , the ‘reference’ value  being the asymptotic value on inﬁnite domains: lim .
c c → Φ = Φ β ∞ ∞  ( 8) The relative error c c c = Φ −Φ Φ ∞ ∞ ε (9) gives the RVE precision.
Hence, a value of β can be associated with a given error.
Table 2 shows that, for a given heterogeneity size lc, a region with a size larger than 80  times lc is needed for  0.05 = ε  and 400 times for  0.01 = ε .
As far as the authors can tell, no RVE for percolation can be found in the literature.
However, it can be compared to classical mechanical problems linked to percolation  issues such as diusivity phenomena or permeation in cement paste.
On these matters,  the results are rather consistent and tend to deﬁne an RVE corresponding to a scale  ratio of  100 β = .
Among the vast literature on that subject, in [36] the authors deﬁne  a cement paste RVE for water diusivity of 100 100 100 × ×  μm3 with heterogeneities  Table 2.  Length ratio and corresponding critical volume of = ε 0.01 and = ε 0.05  error RVE for percolation of excursion sets of the Gaussian RF with the Gaussian  covariance function.

(2016) 033306 represented by polydisperse spheres from 1 μm to 50 μm.
The RVE is then smaller than  what we predict.
Several considerations can explain this dierence.
First, the property  of interest diers.
When the latter RVE is based on a mechanical property (diusivity),  the theoretical approach suggested in this article only takes into consideration the  topological aspect of the morphology.
Secondly, a size distribution of spheres is com- pared to an excursion set with one characteristic length only. 4.2.
N-dimensional percolation As presented in the previous sections, equations (2) and (3) link the marginal distribu- tion of the RF and its spatial structure to the geometrical and topological character- istics of the excursion.
These theoretical results come from [28, 29] in a rather more  general aspect than presented in the paper.
It is especially valid for RF (and thus,  excursions) deﬁned over N-dimensional spaces.
In this space, any morphology can be characterised by N  +  1 independent math- ematical measures ([4, 8]).
In the present case, the base made of the N  +  1 Lipschitz– Killing curvatures  j L  is used [2].
As a measure of Euclidean spaces and ignoring a  factor of scale, they are equivalent to the more commonly used Minkowski functionals,  and can be seen as j-dimensional sizes.
For example, for an N-dimensional hypercube  C a 0 N i N 1[   ] = Π = , they read  C N j a j N j ( ) ⎜ ⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ = L , for j  =  [0..N ].
In 3D they will represent the  volume, half of the surface, twice the calliper diameter and the EC, for j  =  3, 2, 1 and 0,  respectively.
As before, the necessary conditions for the RF is to be twice dierentiable and have  a constant second moment.
Now, let g M : N ⊂  R R be a Gaussian RF and 2 λ  be its  second spectral moment.
If  x x E M g s N {     ( ) } ⊂ κ = ∈ | > R  is the corresponding excursion  set, expectation of the Lipschitz–Killing curvatures can be computed, for j  =  [0..N ], as  follows [2]: E i j i M 2 , j s i N j i j i j i i j i 0 2 /2 { ( )} ( ) ( ) ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ ∑ ω ω ω λ π κ = + γ = − + + L L M E (10) where  N / 1 /2 j N/2 ( ) ω π = Γ +  are the jth volume of the unit ball and, carrying the infor- mation of the RF distribution,  i γ M  are the ith Gaussian Minkowski functionals1.
It is  worth noting that only the latter functionals depend on the threshold κ (see appendix  for their analytical deﬁnitions and [21, 22] for more general cases).
The EC is the ‘0th’  topological measure  Es 0( ) χ = L , whereas the equivalent of the fraction volume is the  speciﬁc Nth measure  E M / N s N ( ) ( ) Φ = L L .
With this generalisation of equations (2) and (3), the same methodology as in sec- tion 1 can be applied for any N.
It is in this spirit that ﬁgure 4 draws the critical vol- umes for percolation (for N  =  2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10).
The critical volumes are now deﬁned  for the percolation of the excursion.
Thus, c c { ( )} κ Φ = Φ + E , with c κ+ being the larger root  of the expected EC.
1 Minkowski-like functionals are used here to measure the probabilistic space, whereas usually Minkowski function- als are used to measure Euclidean spaces.
Herein the Lipschitz–Killing curvatures do this task.
Critical probability of percolation over bounded region in N-dimensional Euclidean space 10 doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2016/03/033306 J. Stat. Mech.
(2016) 033306 According to the literature for inﬁnitely large domains and extended to all  scale ratios, the critical volumes decrease along with increasing spatial dimensions.
Furthermore, increasing the spatial dimensions leads to a larger RVE (see section 4.1).
In other terms, the asymptotic behaviour is obtained for larger domains.
However, it  has to be kept in mind that ﬁgure 4 draws only the percolation probability corresp­ onding to the largest root c κ+.
As noted in [30], in N-dimensional inﬁnite spaces the EC  has N  −  1 roots corresponding to N dierent ‘states’ of percolation and N  −  1 trans­ ition times (the EC roots).
In two dimensions there is one transition time between two  states, namely when it changes, for increasing thresholds, from a percolated excursion  and non-percolated voids to a non-percolated excursion and percolated voids.
In three  dimensions two transitions occur: ﬁrst from a percolated excursion and non-percolated  voids (closed porosity type of morphology) to a percolated excursion and voids (open  porosity type of morphology) and second from the latter state to a non-percolated  excursion to percolated voids (connected components type of morphology).
Since it  goes beyond the standard deﬁnitions it is not clear to us what the other states mean in  higher dimensions.
We think that, as three-dimensional topological entities (handles)  allow us to yield additional percolation states compared to the two-dimensional case,  higher topological entities can produce the same eect.
However, it is because we only  consider the higher EC root that we assume it detects the percolation of the excursion.
Finally, attention is drawn to the asymptotic behaviour of the critical volumes for  very large domains.
For that matter, ﬁgure 5 shows  c Φ∞ as deﬁned in equation (8) as a  function of N.
As was already noticeable in ﬁgure 4, it can be seen in ﬁgure 5 that, for N  =  2, the  critical percolation probability of bond lattices pc  =  1/2 [12] is retrieved.
However,  going further in dimensions increases drastically the dierence between the models.
A  comparison is made here, ﬁrst with the results from [31], where percolation threshold  Figure 4.  Critical volume for percolation Φc as a function of the scale ratio β for  hypercubes in dierent spatial dimensions in the case of excursion sets of the  Gaussian RF with the Gaussian covariance function.

For the sake of  comparison, the data drawn are the equivalent critical volume  1 e c c Φ = − η −.
Then  comparison is made with bond percolation probability pc on the lattice from [7].
The  dierence between these results comes from the rather dierent physical natures of the  models and even the deﬁnition of percolation.
However, the tendency of a smaller criti- cal percolation probability with a higher dimension seems to be conﬁrmed.
5. Concluding remarks We propose an analytical model that determines the critical probability of percolation  over bounded regions in N-dimensional Euclidean space through topological estima- tion.
It is based on the probabilistic knowledge of the measures of excursion sets based  on the correlated RF.
First, the EC is used to detect percolation through its null val- ues and then, the corresponding N-dimensional volume fraction is the so-called critical  volume c Φ that links the continuum aspect of excursions and the well-known critical  probability pc.
Analysis has mainly been made through 3D examples.
The model is able to retrieve  results from the literature such as the critical volume  0.16 c Φ ≈  for inﬁnite regions.
But, more importantly, since the model can predict percolation for bounded regions  the percolation probability is considered as a function of a scale ratio (or domain size)  and the results stated just above are their asymptotic values.
This feature is used in a  concrete example where statistically Representative Volume Elements for percolation  have been analytically determined.
An extension to N-dimensional spaces is proposed,  showing the general aspect of this analytical framework.

(2016) 033306 other frameworks, this model does not provide information on the subcritical and  supercritical behaviour.
Several lines of investigation can come out from these results.
For example, an anal- ysis between topological prediction and the critical behaviours in the case of excursion  sets can be made with Monte-Carlo simulations in order to see how well the EC pre- dicts continuum percolation.
Another useful way is to compare the present approach  with average concentrations of spanning clusters from ﬁnite-size scaling frameworks  (see chapter 4.1 of [26]) where the impact of the size of the observation window can be  analysed. Appendix.
Gaussian Minkowski functionals By explaining how the Minkowski functionals are linked to the probability of the Random  Field to be greater than the threshold  x g( ) κ > , or in other words, the probability of  the Random Field to be in the so-called hitting set  x g , ( ) [ [ κ ∈ ∞, this appendix gives  the analytical deﬁnition of the Gaussian Minkowski functionals  i γ M  in equation (10). A.1.
Taylor expansion of the tube Gaussian volumes In contrast to Lipschitz–Killing curvatures, the Minkowski functionals are not intrinsic.
Therefore, they depend on the measure associated with it.
Herein, the measure of a  Gaussian distribution is of concern.
Let kγ  be such a measure in the Euclidean space  k R .
If X Xi { } =  is a standard Gaussian vector of size k in which X i k 0, , 1.. i 2 N ( ) [ ] σ ∼ =   are independent and A k ⊂R : X x A P A 1 2 e d .
x k k k A /2 /2 2 2 ( ) { } ( ) ∥∥ ∫ γ σ π = ∈ = σ −  (A.1) Associated with this measure, the functionals are now called Gaussian Minkowski func- tionals (hereafter GMFs).
In a k-dimensional space, k  +  1 GMFs are deﬁned, noted  j kγ M , j  =  [0..N ].
The main results of [28] is to yield the following Taylor expansion of tube  probability: A j A , ! .
k j j j 0 k ( ( )) ( ) ∑ γ ρ ρ = γ = ∞ K M  (A.2) for small enough ρ, where  A, ( ) ρ K  is the tube of A of ray ρ.
It can be seen as an exten- sion of the Steiner–Weyls formula, in which kγ  represents the volume in the sense of the  Gaussian measure (Gaussian volume).
By taking  0 ρ = , it can be concluded that the  ﬁrst Gaussian Minkowski functional is the Gaussian volume of A itself, A A k 0 k( ) ( ) γ = γ M .
Other GMFs can be identiﬁed in speciﬁc cases. A.2.
Application to scalar-valued Gaussian random ﬁelds Even though the presented formulae work for more general cases, it suces in this  case to take k  =  1, corresponding to a scalar-valued RF g : 3 → R R and excursion sets  deﬁned as:Critical probability of percolation over bounded region in N-dimensional Euclidean space 13 doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2016/03/033306 J.
