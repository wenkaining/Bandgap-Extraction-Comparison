By utilizing a ﬁrst-order phase transformation of the material, a pyroelectric device can generate an adequate amount of electricity from small temperature ﬂuctuations.
However, most pyroelectric capaci- tors leak during energy conversion.
In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamics of pyroelectric energy conversion with consideration of electric leakage.
Our thermodynamic model is veriﬁed by experiments using three phase-transforming ferroelectric materials with diﬀerent pyroelectric properties and leakage behaviors.
We demonstrate that the impact of leakage on electric generation is prominent, and sometimes may be confused with the actual power generation by pyroelectricity.
We discover a material candidate, (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Zr, Ce)O3, that exhibits a large pyroelectric current and an extremely low leakage current.
A pyroelectric converter made of this material generates a pyroelectric current density of 1.95 μA/cm2 and a pyroelectric work density of 0.2 J/cm3 even after 1389 thermodynamic-conversion cycles.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.064079 I. INTRODUCTION Energy harvesting from waste heat is an emerging research ﬁeld in sustainable-energy science [1].
This heat, particularly in the low-grade regime (i.e., below 250 ◦C), is abundant in nature and can be obtained from solar radiation and geothermal activity.
Industry and human daily activities generate an immense amount of waste heat below 200 ◦C. Ferroelectric materials with a temperature- dependent polarization have attracted increasing attention in recent years for electricity generation from tempera- tures from 40 to 150 ◦C [2–5].
The mechanism of this energy conversion is commonly characterized as a pyro- electric eﬀect.
Many reported energy converters are made from a capacitor with a dielectric layer whose pyroelec- tric properties are designed for harvesting low-grade heat.
Most of them are thin-ﬁlm devices [4,5] working under a bias electric ﬁeld, provided by external power.
The electric energy generated by these devices is usually confused with the applied bias electric ﬁeld.
Without such a bias electric ﬁeld, the performance of the energy conversion becomes rather marginal [2,4].
Removal of the bias electric ﬁeld redeﬁnes the thermo- dynamic cycle for pyroelectric energy conversion based on small temperature ﬂuctuations.
Several thermodynamic models, depending on the initial conditions, have been *xianchen@ust.hk proposed for analyzing the power output of power-source- free pyroelectric generators [6–8].
In our previous study of phase-transformation pyroelectric energy conversion, the initial state of the thermodynamic system is chosen as (PL, EL, TL), where the temperature TL is lower than the transition temperature, the working conjugate of the polarization is PL, and the electric ﬁeld is EL > 0 in the ferroelectric phase.
The initial polarization is achieved by use of an external dc voltage source.
For a bulk capaci- tor with a thickness between 0.5 and 1 mm, the applied dc voltage is usually in the range of 30–50 V [6,7].
When the ferroelectric capacitor is balanced with its charge reservoir, the external dc voltage source is removed and the system is assumed to be electrically isolated.
When the ferroelec- tric material undergoes a phase transformation, the charge starts ﬂowing.
Therefore, this is a constant-current-output energy-conversion device.
Ideally, the total charge in the isolated system is preserved, if the phase-transforming dielectric layer is a perfect insulator.
However, charge leakage is unavoidable and non-negligible, especially at elevated temperature, for perovskite oxides [8–13].
Over numerous energy-conversion cycles, the performance of the device degrades signiﬁcantly, which greatly hinders the practical application of this energy-conversion technol- ogy.
For thin-ﬁlm capacitors, the leakage current is a more critical problem for electricity generation [10,13,14].

The charge leaks inside the dielectric layer as the energy conversion begins.
Unlike the case for an ideal insulation system, the electric ﬁeld in the phase- transforming planar capacitor cannot reach its initial value again after each of the energy-conversion cycles, as illus- trated in Fig. 1(b). II.
THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS We consider the phase-transforming capacitor as a ther- modynamic system.
When the system ﬂuctuates thermally about the phase-transformation temperature Tc, the charge Q held by the capacitor falls and rises accordingly due to the alternation of the capacitance caused by the ﬁrst-order phase transformation between the ferroelectric and para- electric phases.
The charge can be expressed as a function of the temperature of the phase-transforming capacitor, T, and the voltage on the capacitor, V, i.e., Q = Q(V, T).
Dur- ing the cyclic thermodynamic processes between the states (QL, VL, TL) and (QH, VH, TH), where TL < Tc < TH, all three state variables (Q, V, T) change simultaneously with- out the application of a bias electric ﬁeld [6].
If we consider a planar capacitor, the voltage is proportional to the electric ﬁeld in the capacitor.
Let t = 0 mark the time of the begin- ning of the ﬁrst thermodynamic cycle [cycle 1 in Fig. 1(b)].
The electric ﬁeld in the capacitor is E(0) = E0 = V0 d , where V0 is gained by connecting the whole electric cir- cuit in Fig. 1(a) to an external dc source.
Let t > 0 mark the time period of the energy-conversion processes after the removal of the external dc source.
Because of electric leakage, the stored charge Q(V, T) cannot reach the ini- tial state of the previous thermodynamic cycle, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
In this case, the relative starting state of the next cycle drifts down along the polarization curve.
As a result, the thermodynamic system is cycle-dependent.
Let the time tn label the starting state of the nth cycle: E(tn+1) < E(tn) < E(tn−1) < · · · < E0.
Consequently, the stored charge in the ferroelectric phase decreases after every cycle.
If such leakage continues, there is no charge left after a ﬁnite number of energy- conversion cycles, which causes the electricity-generation process to cease.
A. Governing equations of energy conversion At t = 0, the total charge in the system is calculated from Qtot = CrefV0 + Q(V0, TL), (1) where Cref denotes the capacitance of the nontransform- ing capacitor, considered as a reference capacitor in our experiment.
At t > 0, the charge balance can be expressed as Qtot −  t 0 Ic(ξ) dξ = Qref(t) + Q(V(t), T(t)), (2) where Qref is a time-dependent function deﬁning the charge held by the reference capacitor for t > 0, and the func- tion Ic represents the charge-leakage current in the phase- transforming ferroelectric capacitor, which is nonzero after energy conversion starts.
Considering the electric circuit in Fig. 1(a), we have V(t) = Vd(t) + Qref(t) Cref , (3) where Vd is the voltage on the load resistor.
Substitut- ing Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) and taking the ﬁrst-order time derivative, we get ˙Q + Cref ˙V + Ic −˙VdCref = 0.
(4) Since Q is a function of V, Eq. (4) is a ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) for the variables V and Vd.
The voltage on the load resistor is attributed to the generation 064079-2IMPACT OF LEAKAGE FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION... PHYS. REV.
APPLIED 14, 064079 (2020) of a current −˙Q and the leakage current Ic, as follows: Vd = −( ˙Q + Ic)R. (5) Therefore, the governing equation can be written as RCref ¨Q + ˙Q + Cref ˙V + Ic + RCref ˙Ic = 0.
(6) Equation (6) is a second-order ODE for the variable V. We assume that the voltage applied across the thin-plate phase- transforming pyroelectric capacitor is linearly related to the electric ﬁeld E by V = Ed, where d denotes the thick- ness of the thin plate.
The constitutive relations for Q and Ic can be also characterized as Q(E, T) = Aq(E, T) and Ic(E, T) = AJ(E, T), where A is the area of the planar capacitor, and q(E, T) and J(E, T) are the charge density and leakage-current density.
Modulated by the area A, Eq. (6) becomes RCref¨q + ˙q + d ACref ˙E + J + RCref ˙J = 0.
(7) B. Characterization of ferroelectric properties According to the constitutive relation [15], the charge density of the phase-transforming pyroelectric capacitor is a function of the electric ﬁeld E and the temperature T, q = ε0E + P(E, T), (8) where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and the constitu- tive function P(E, T) is the polarization of the phase- transforming ferroelectric material.
The ﬁrst- and second- order time derivatives can be calculated directly from Eq. (8) using the partial diﬀerential quantities P,E = ∂P/∂E, P,T = ∂P/∂T, P,EE = ∂2P/∂E2, P,TT = ∂2P/∂T2, and P,TE = ∂2P/∂T∂E, among which κ = P,T is an impor- tant ferroelectric property and is deﬁned as the pyroelectric coeﬃcient.
This coeﬃcient has been widely used to judge the performance of pyroelectric generators [3,5,16].
Note that when a ﬁrst-order phase transformation is coupled with the pyroelectric properties, these derivatives vary with the temperature and electric ﬁeld.
The constitutive relations P(E, T) and J(E, T) are exper- imentally characterized with a ferroelectric-analyzer sys- tem (aixACCT TF Analyzer 2000E).
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature-dependent ferroelectric polariza- tion and leakage-current density in polycrystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) under diﬀerent electric ﬁelds from 0 to 2 kV/cm.
At room temperature under a small applied ﬁeld, the leakage-current density is about 0.1 μA/cm2.
The elec- tric leakage of the material becomes more prominent at elevated temperatures under a larger applied electric ﬁeld.
In our energy-conversion experiment, the working elec- tric ﬁeld in the pyroelectric capacitor is between 0.5 and 1.2 kV/cm.
When the applied electric ﬁeld is higher than (a) (b) (c) (d) FIG.
2. Temperature-dependent (a) polarization and (b) leakage-current density of phase-transforming BaTiO3 under electric ﬁelds from 0 to 2 kV/cm in the temperature range from 380 to 410 K, corresponding to the derivatives (c) P,T (red), P,TE (blue) and (d) P,E (red), P,EE (blue).
1.2 kV/cm, the increase in the leakage current becomes much rapid in the elevated-temperature regime.
In a thin- ﬁlm capacitor, the leakage is more problematic than in the bulk.
For example, the leakage current of a barium titanate thin-ﬁlm capacitor is about 5–10 times larger under sim- ilar electric and thermal conditions [17].
Compared with barium titanate, PbTiO3-based thin-ﬁlm capacitors exhibit even larger leakage [17,18].
In the temperature regime characterized, the polarization of the material decreases as the temperature increases, with an abrupt drop at 395 K, which reveals the ﬁrst-order phase transformation between the tetragonal and cubic phases.
Evidently, Fig. 2(c) shows a singularity in the pyroelectric coeﬃcient (i.e., P,T) at 395 K. Similarly, the derivative P,E is also singular at the phase-transformation temperature.
Because of this singu- larity, the conventional formula for the pyroelectric current [16] cannot be applied in the vicinity of the ﬁrst-order phase transformation when a ﬁrst-order phase transfor- mation occurs.
Instead, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation needs to be considered in a thermodynamic analysis of the energy-conversion process [6–8].
The second-order derivatives P,EE and P,TE are calculated numerically, as shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), and are very small com- pared with the ﬁrst-derivative functions.
For simplicity, we neglect these second-order derivatives in the numeri- cal solution of the governing equation (7).
Note that we keep the second-order derivative P,TT in all computations.
After dropping terms P,TE and P,EE, the governing equation (7) becomes (ε0 + P,E) ¨E + C1 ˙E + C2 = 0, (9) 064079-3ZHANG, ZENG, ZHU, KARAMI, and CHEN PHYS. REV.

(11) This can be solved numerically for the initial conditions E(0) = E0 = V0 d , ˙E(0) = 0.
(12) In order to benchmark materials of diﬀerent geometry in various experimental settings, dimensionless variables are used in the governing equation; these are represented by symbols with an overbar, ¯·.
For a speciﬁc phase- transforming pyroelectric planar capacitor with thickness d and an initial charging voltage V(0) = V0 associated with an electric ﬁeld E0 = V0/d at a temperature TL lower than the phase transition temperature, the nondimensional voltage, electric ﬁeld, temperature, and time are deﬁned as ¯V = V V0 , ¯E = E E0 , ¯T = T −TL TH −TL , ¯t = t τ , (13) where the working temperature range of the device is between TL and TH, such that TL < Tc < TH.
The process takes τ seconds per cycle, which fully covers the dura- tion of the phase transformation.
According to Eq. (13), the values of ¯V, ¯E, ¯T, and ¯t are all between 0 and 1.
Let PL = P(E0, TL) be the initial polarization in the fer- roelectric phase, and let JH = J(E0, TH) be the highest leakage-current density.
The nondimensional polarization and leakage-current density are deﬁned as ¯P = P PL , ¯J = J JH ∈[0, 1].

EXPERIMENT We use three barium titanate–based ferroelectric mate- rials to investigate the inﬂuence of electric leakage on pyroelectric energy conversion, and to verify our numerical model expressed by Eq. (17).
These materi- als are polycrystalline BaTiO3, Ba(Ti, Zr0.01)O3 (BZT), and (Ba, Ca0.05)(Ti, Zr0.01, Ce0.01)O3 (tridoped BTO).
The BTO and BZT are synthesized by a conventional ceramic sintering method; the detailed procedure is described in Ref. [6].
Their ferroelectric properties are summarized in Fig. 3(a).
This shows that the addition of Zr increases the polarization in the ferroelectric phase.
As shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b), the two materials exhibit similar trends in the leakage as the temperature increases under diﬀerent elec- tric ﬁelds.
From the point of view of energy conversion, the ﬁgure of merit for BZT is higher than that for BTO, but the leakage is much smaller in BTO than in BZT.
The elements Ca and Ce have been experimentally proven to be eﬀective dopants for preventing electric leakage in barium titanate [19,20].
The mechanism is via a reduction in the number of oxygen vacancies, which consequently enhances the insu- lation [21,22].
The Ca dopant was found to narrow the temperature range of the phase transformation [19], which potentially improves the pyroelectric coeﬃcient.
Based on the BZT material, we design the tridoped BTO, which may give a small leakage while the pyroelectric performance is still maintained.
The tridoped BTO is synthesized by the ﬂoating-zone method, which is commonly used for grow- ing single crystals and textured polycrystals [23,24].
The addition of cerium to BTO may increase the grain size and change the photorefractive properties at high temper- ature [25,26], which facilitates the growth of crystals with 064079-4IMPACT OF LEAKAGE FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION... PHYS. REV.

In this study, we aim at synthesizing a pyroelectric material with better ferroelectric properties than those of BTO but with lower electric leakage than BZT to verify our thermodynamic model of pyroelectric energy conversion.
Powders of CaCO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), CeO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), ZrO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), BaCO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.8%), and TiO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.8%) are weighed out according to the stoichiometric formulation Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.98Zr0.01Ce0.01O3, dissolved in ethanol, and milled with zirconia balls in a planetary ball miller at 630 rpm for 24 h. The ball-milled solution is dried and calcined at 1000 ◦C for 10 h to obtain the tridoped barium titanate powder through solid-state reaction.
Under 30 MPa hydro- static pressure for 30 min, the powder is hot-pressed into a rod-shaped green body of diameter 6 mm and length 10 mm.
The green body is sintered to form feed and seed rods in a four-mirror infrared furnace (Quantum Design IRF11-001-00) by passing it through the focal point slowly with an axial speed of 3 mm/h and an angular speed of 3 rpm.
The feed and seed rods are aligned vertically for a ﬂoating-zone experiment using the same infrared furnace at a growth speed of 10 mm/h and a relative angular speed of 50 rpm in air.
A molten zone is created and is monitored throughout the entire growth period.
Finally, the as-grown rod is solidiﬁed and sliced along the growth direction.
The composition of the as-grown bulk material is charac- terized by energy-dispersive x-ray-spectroscopy analysis.
The measured atomic composition is close to the nominal one to within 0.01 at. %.
The microstructures of our samples are characterized by use of a dual-beam-shear diﬀerential-interference-contrast microscope [27].
The surfaces of three samples are pol- ished well with a 1-μm diamond suspension and etched with a 37% HCl solution for 10 min to reveal the grain morphology.
Various crystallographic textures are distin- guished by their brightness in the micrographs, since their reﬂectivity and phase contrast are diﬀerent, as shown in Fig. 4.
For BTO and BZT, the grain size is relatively ﬁne, i.e., about 70 μm, while for the tridoped BTO, the grains grow about 5–8 times larger.
The signiﬁcant grain coarsening may be due to the ﬂoating-zone growth process [24].
Twinned structures are observed inside the grains for all three materials.
Compared with the BTO and BZT samples made by the traditional synthesis approach, the tri- doped BTO has many fewer pores.
Consequently, it has the highest density, 5.774 g/cm3, compared with BTO (5.325 g/cm3) and BZT (5.248 g/cm3). IV.
RESULTS Figure 3(a) compares the temperature-dependent polar- ization of BTO (red), BZT (blue), and tridoped BTO (green) under diﬀerent electric ﬁelds from 0 to 2 kV/cm.
Within the temperature range tested, all samples undergo a ﬁrst-order phase transformation accompanied by an abrupt polarization jump from ferroelectric phase to paraelectric phase.
Among these materials, the tridoped BTO exhibits the largest polarization (11 μC/cm2) in the ferroelectric phase, making it a good candidate for pyroelectric energy conversion.
In Fig. 3(c), the electric leakage is reduced greatly in tridoped BTO; its value is about 1/6 of that for BTO and 1/200 of that for BZT in the ferroelectric phase.
The benchmark of the leakage-current density under the working conditions for energy conversion is shown in Fig. 3(d).
In sharp contrast to BZT and BTO, the leakage in the tridoped ferroelectric material is much suppressed even in the temperature regime higher than the phase-transition temperature.
In addition, we observe that the ﬁrst-order phase transformation of tridoped BTO is more gradual than that of BZT, which indicates that the pyroelectric coef- ﬁcient at the phase transformation is moderate compared with that of BZT.
The measured pyroelectric coeﬃcients are 0.42 μC/cm2 K for BTO, 1.89 μC/cm2 K for BZT, and 0.87 μC/cm2 K for tridoped BTO.
We use these three materials as dielectric layers to fab- ricate planar capacitors with geometries of 37.44 mm2 × 0.74 mm for BTO, 59.44 mm2 × 0.257 mm for BZT, and 66.59 mm2 × 0.445 mm for tridoped BTO.
Using the energy-conversion electric circuit in Fig. 1(a), each of the phase-transforming capacitors is connected to a 100-k load resistor and a 50-μF reference capacitor in series.
Before energy conversion, we use an external dc 064079-5ZHANG, ZENG, ZHU, KARAMI, and CHEN PHYS. REV.

voltage source (Tektronix PS280) to charge the entire sys- tem so that both the phase-transforming capacitor and the reference capacitor are at a voltage of 30 V, and no electric charge ﬂows in the circuit.
Then, the external dc voltage source is disconnected at a temperature TL < Tc.
During the demonstration of pyroelectric energy conver- sion, the phase transformation is induced by passing the material through the transformation temperature under an electric ﬁeld.
The ferroelectric phase is polarized by the applied electric ﬁeld at low temperature.
The temperature- dependent polarization follows the constitutive relation in Fig. 3(a) with application of the external ﬁeld.
We use a custom-made thermal stage to drive the tem- perature of the phase-transforming capacitor in a periodic pattern around its transition temperature.
For each of the phase-transforming capacitors, we collect ﬁve consecu- tive thermal cycles, as shown in Figs. 5(a), 5(c), and 5(e), corresponding to TL = 360 K and TH = 410 K. The total durations of all thermal cycles are 175 s for BTO, 133 s for BZT, and 120 s for tridoped BTO; these values are used to derive the nondimensionalized time variable.
The aver- age transformation times per cycle for them, that is, the value of τ in Eq. (13), are calculated as 17.5 s for BTO, 13.3 s for BZT, and 12 s for tridoped BTO.

APPLIED 14, 064079 (2020) temperature patterns for these materials are plotted as blue curves in Figs. 5(a), 5(c), and 5(e).
The pyrocurrent is characterized by the current passing through the load resistor, of resistance R, calculated as Ip = ipA, (21) where ip = −(˙q + J) = −  (ϵ0 + P,E) ˙E + P,T ˙T + J  (22) is the pyrocurrent density for an area A.
This current is attributed to a charge ﬂow driven by the change in polarization and the internal leakage in the pyroelectric capacitor.
As a result, the electric ﬁeld across the pyro- electric capacitor decreases continuously throughout the energy-conversion process.
The pyrocurrent measured in the experiments (red) is shown in Figs. 5(b) for BTO, 5(d) for BZT, and 5(f) for tridoped BTO, corresponding to numerical solutions (blue) of Eq. (17).
The generation of a pyrocurrent in consecutive thermal cycles is well cap- tured by our thermodynamic model for the three samples with diﬀerent ferroelectric properties.
We conjecture that three factors play an important role in pyroelectric energy conversion by use of a ﬁrst-order phase transformation: (1) the polarization jump between the states before and after the phase transformation, (2) the pyroelectric coeﬃcient at the transition temperature, and (3) the leakage-current density within the range of thermal ﬂuctuations applied to the sample.
For the BTO sample, all three factors are low, which indicates that it is a good insulator but a bad pyroelectric-conversion material, corresponding to a very small pyrocurrent density (66.8 nA/cm2) in all ﬁve cycles.
The BZT sample is a good energy-conversion material, having the largest pyroelectric coeﬃcient among the three samples, and enhanced polarization in the ferroelectric phase.
But it is a bad insulator, with a non-negligible leakage.
Considering a full loop of the phase transforma- tion, its averaged pyrocurrent density for the ﬁrst cycle is 1.17 μA/cm2, which degrades to 0.34 μA/cm2 after ﬁve cycles.
Since the charge leakage is unidirectional, both the measured and the computed pyrocurrent for BZT are biased toward the negative direction with respect to the neutral point.
The contribution of the leakage current to the work done in the load resistor sometimes hides the true amount of electric energy converted by the pyroelectric material [28–30].
For the tridoped BTO, both the pyroelec- tric capability and the insulation are enhanced greatly.
As a result, it shows a pyrocurrent density of 1.95 μA/cm2 without degradation at the end of the ﬁfth cycle.
The pyrocurrent achieved in tridoped BTO is around 3 times larger than the largest pyrocurrent reported so far for single-crystal barium titanate with a narrow transition win- dow (5 K) when the polar axis is aligned with the electric ﬁeld [7].
V. DISCUSSION We use the least leaky pyroelectric capacitor (i.e., the tridoped-BTO capacitor) to conduct more cycles under dif- ferent working conditions.
Figure 6 compares the pyrocur- rent given by the tridoped BTO capacitor in a fully discharged state and a 30-V charged state.
In the same experiment setup as used for energy conversion, the gen- erated pyrocurrent strongly depends on the initial state QL(VL, TL).
A fully discharged pyroelectric capacitor with VL = 0 produces a much smaller amount of electricity than that produced by the same capacitor with VL = 30 V.
If the pyroelectric material is leaky, the capacitor continues to discharge while converting energy cyclically.
This intrinsic discharging eventually causes the production of electricity in the system to cease, even though the material itself is pyroelectrically functional.
This opens up a discussion of the eﬀective life of a pyroelectric energy converter with intrinsic leakage.

Material N ∗ W(N ∗) (J/cm3) Wπ(N ∗) (J/cm3) W(N ∗) Wπ(N ∗) (%) BTO 502 6.24 × 10−4 8.36 × 10−4 75 BZT 9 8.92 × 10−4 0.0049 18 Tridoped BTO 1389 0.1997 0.2018 99 [TL, TH] fully covers the ﬁrst-order phase transformation from ferroelectric to paraelectric.
We assume that the cool- ing process from TH is time-symmetric with respect to the ﬁrst thermodynamic half cycle.
Then the electric ﬁeld in the Nth thermodynamic cycle is E(2Nτ) < · · · < E(2τ) < E(0) = V0 d .
(23) By solving Eq. (17), we can calculate the electric ﬁeld E(2Nτ) for N ∈Z+.
The eﬀective life is deﬁned as the number of thermodynamic cycles N ∗such that E(2(N ∗+ 1)τ) < V0 2d < E(2N ∗τ).
(24) This means that after N ∗cycles, the electric ﬁeld in the pyroelectric capacitor has been reduced to half of the value that it had when the capacitor was initially charged.
If we consider only the current output from pyroelectric energy conversion, the output electric energy density in the load resistor can be calculated as W(N) = AR d  2Nτ 0 ˙q2 dt, (25) where ˙q denotes the current density passing through the load resistor R. Considering the work done by the electro- static force in the pyroelectric capacitor during the cyclic thermodynamic processes, we deﬁne the pyrowork as Wπ(N) = −  2Nτ 0 E ˙P dt.
(26) Here the electric ﬁeld should satisfy the governing equation (17) for the driving temperature proﬁle T(t).
The polarization is evaluated by use of the experimentally characterized constitutive relations (Figs. 2 and 3).
We calculate the eﬀective life, the output work density, and the pyrowork density for BTO, BZT, and tridoped BTO capacitors; the results are summarized in Table I. Without leakage, the output electric energy is expected to be the same as the electrostatic energy produced by the pyroelectric capacitor [6].
The loss of energy captured by our thermodynamic model is due to the internal loss of charge during cyclic energy-conversion processes.
For the most leaky capacitor, made from BZT, the pyroelec- tric energy conversion ceases at the end of the ninth cycle.
Until it is recharged by an external battery, it will not then produce electricity by the pyroelectric eﬀect even if the pyroelectric material is still functional.
Overall, the BZT capacitor outputs 8.92 × 10−4 J/cm3 of electric energy converted purely from heat.
For the BTO-based capaci- tors, the energy-conversion performance does not degrade much over hundreds to thousands of cycles.
Particularly, the Ce-, Ca-, and Zr-doped BTO capacitor generates 0.2 J/cm3 of electric energy in a total of 1389 cycles, that is, 3 orders of magnitude larger than the amount of energy produced by the other two materials.
More importantly, the electric energy collected in the external circuit is almost equal to the electrostatic work done during the pyroelec- tric energy conversion.
With such a value, a pyroelectric device can be actually useful in real energy applications. VI.
CONCLUSION This paper underlines the inﬂuence of leakage on the performance of pyroelectric energy conversion using ﬁrst- order phase-transforming ferroelectrics.
Through experi- ments and numerical simulations done for BTO, BZT, and tridoped BTO, we show that tridoped BTO is the most suitable material for pyroelectric energy conversion because of its singular polarization properties and much reduced leakage.
Our model conﬁrms that the degradation of the energy-conversion performance strongly depends on the leakage-current density of the pyroelectric mate- rial.
To design a power-source-free pyroelectric energy- conversion system that can continuously harvest electricity from waste heat, both the pyroelectric properties and the leakage-current density need to be taken into account.
Our work should provide a useful reference for the future development of high-performance ferroelectric materials and the design of energy-conversion systems.
