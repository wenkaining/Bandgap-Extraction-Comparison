In most of the current excitonic materials there exists a direct connection between the exciton robustness to thermal fluctuations and the strength of the exciton−exciton interaction, making materials with the highest levels of exciton nonlinearity applicable at cryogenic temperatures only.
Here, we show that strong polaronic effects, characteristic for perovskite materials, allow overcoming this limitation.
Namely, we demonstrate a record-high value of the nonlinear optical response in the nanostructured organic−inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI3, experimentally detected as a 19.7 meV blueshift of the polariton branch under femtosecond laser irradiation.
This is substantially higher than characteristic values for the samples based on conventional semiconductors and monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides.
The observed strong polaron-enhanced nonlinearity exists for both tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of MAPbI3 and remains stable at elevated temperatures.
KEYWORDS: exciton-polaritons, polariton nonlinearity, polarons, planar cavity, nanoimprint, perovskites E xcitons are solid state analogues of a hydrogen atom, appearing due to the Coulomb attraction between an electron in a conduction band and a hole in a valence band.
In direct band-gap semiconductors they can be created optically by resonant absorption of photons.
If the energy of an exciton−photon interaction exceeds all characteristic broad- enings in a system, the regime of strong light−matter coupling is achieved.
It is characterized by the emergence of hybrid half- light half-matter elementary excitations, known as exciton- polaritons.
To drive a system into this regime, one needs to reach an efficient confinement of the electromagnetic field, which can be achieved in semiconductor microcavities,1 optical waveguides,2 photonic bound states in a continuum,3 or leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs.4 Exciton-polaritons demon- strate a set of remarkable properties, which makes them ideal candidates for both the fundamental study of a variety of quantum collective phenomena5 and modern optoelectronic applications.6 In particular, from their photonic component they inherit an extremely small effective mass and long decoherence time, while the presence of the excitonic component allows for efficient polariton−polariton interac- tions, leading to the onset of a robust nonlinear optical response.
The latter is experimentally revealed as a blueshift of a polariton line with the increase in pumping power.
From a technological perspective, it is clearly highly desirable to have a material platform that combines the thermal stability of excitons and polaritons with a strong degree of their optical nonlinearity.
For more than a decade, the study of the nonlinear excitonic response was focused on conventional semiconductor platforms, including both narrow- band-gap (e.g., CdTe7 and GaAs8−11) and wide-band-gap materials (e.g., GaN12−14 and ZnO15,16), where excitons are well described by the hydrogen model.
Essentially, while the blueshift per single polariton tells us about how well the nonlinear polariton systems perform at low excitation density, the maximum value of the blueshift enabled by a polariton system characterizes its nonlinear optical response at high density.
For wide-band-gap materials excitons have a much smaller effective size aB (exciton Bohr radius), which decreases the exciton−exciton interaction constant VXX (often referred to as g and defined mostly by the processes of electron and hole exchange17), and thus the blueshift per polariton is reduced also.
At the same time the reduction of the Bohr radius substantially increases the Mott transition density.
This, in general, allows reaching greater values of the maximum possible blueshift of an excitonic line.

The blueshift value can be evaluated as E V n V n /2 XX XX max max 2 max 2 | | (1) Here nmax = VXX/|4VXX2| is the inflection point, defining the applicability range of eq 1, which is tentatively below the Mott transition density.
The parameter VXX2 corresponds to higher- order (three-body) interactions, which have an opposite sign and strongly suppress the blueshift at large densities.18 This tendency is illustrated in Figure 1a, where linear scaling of ΔEmax with the exciton binding energy EB can be clearly seen for the cases of both bulk excitons (green line) and 2D quantum well excitons (orange line).
It should be noted that experimentally reported blueshifts are essentially smaller than the values given by this simple estimate.
This is connected with practical problems of approaching the Mott transition limit without substantial heating of the sample and other undesired side effects.
The observed values of polaritonic blueshift for various materials are summarized in Table 1.
To our knowledge, the maximum values reached so far are about 13 meV, observed in microcavities with active media consisting of WS2 monolayers.
Further details of the Coulomb-interaction- induced exciton blueshift in different systems are discussed in Sections 5.1−5.3 and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information.
The deviation from the discussed tendency is possible, if the electron−electron interaction differs substantially from the Coulomb law.
One of the notorious examples of such materials are monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD), where the dimensional reduction makes an exciton state different from that described by the hydrogen model.19 This results, among others, in a strong deviation (Figure 1a) of its nonlinear behavior from the general trend.3,20,21 Note, however, that from the point of view of excitonic nonlinearity the case of TMD monolayers is suboptimal, as the corresponding points lie below the line describing the case of the quantum wells of conventional semiconductors.
Moreover, it is still challenging to find a way to boost the excitonic nonlinearity for 3D materials.
In turn, it is well-known that hybrid halide perovskites possess strong electron−phonon interactions, which are defined by high softness of their crystalline lattice22 (see Figure 1b).
Moreover, excitons in these materials are characterized by a relatively high exciton binding energy and oscillator strength23 and high defect tolerance,24 which make perovskites highly attractive for studying room-temperature exciton-polariton dynamics and even Bose−Einstein con- Figure 1.
(a) Estimated values of the maximum blueshift induced by exciton−exciton interactions in the quadratic approximation, ΔEmax = VXXnmax/2 −|VXX2|nmax 2 , where nmax = 0.05/aB d and d = 2, 3 are the densities corresponding to the maximum blueshift for 2D and 3D materials, respectively.
The values corresponding to the hydrogen model, applicable to the vast majority of conventional semiconductors (GaAs, CdTe, GaN, ZnSe, and CuBr are taken as examples), lie on straight blue (3D) and orange (2D) lines.
The points below these lines correspond to materials that are suboptimal for optical nonlinearity (e.g., TMD monolayers, red circle) and the points above these lines, such as the MAPbI3 perovskite considered in the present work (dark blue circles), to optimal materials.
The values of nmax for the exciton-polarons in perovskites and excitons in TMD monolayers are distinct from those of 3D and 2D hydrogen models and depend on particular material parameters.

2022, 22, 9092−9099 9093densation.25−30 An analysis of the corresponding nonlinearities thus seems to be an important task.
Here we present clear experimental evidence, supported by theoretical modeling, that exciton−phonon coupling leading to the formation of exciton-polarons in hybrid halide perovskites substantially modifies exciton−exciton interactions and allows a dramatic increase in the nonlinear optical response (Figure 1d), which is characterized by a record high value of the polariton blueshift up to 19.7 meV, remaining robust at elevated temperatures (170 K).
The big technological advantage of the use of halide perovskites for photonic applications41 is the variety of low- cost wet chemistry synthesis protocols to get high-quality thin films,42 for which additional nanostructuring can be routinely carried out by well-developed and efficient methods such as nanoimprint lithography.43 In particular, in order to achieve the strong exciton−photon coupling regime, instead of using vertical Bragg cavities to confine photons, one can realize a 1D photonic crystal slab by directly imprinting a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film.
Since perovskites have a relatively high refractive index contrast with both air and the glass substrate (nMAPbI d3 ≈2.2−2.5, nglass ≈1.5), the well-localized leaky modes supported by the grating are characterized by local field enhancement, enabling their strong coupling with excitons possessing a high optical oscillator strength.
In the current work, thin and smooth films of MAPbI3 were fabricated by a spin-coating method in a nitrogen drybox.43 The obtained films were patterned by means of nanoimprint lithography using a periodic mold with a rectangular profile, as is schematically shown in Figure 1c.
The resulting MAPbI3 photonic crystal slab is characterized by a thickness of 150 nm, Table 1.

To confirm the formation of exciton-polaritons, we performed angle-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectros- copy measurements (see Methods) of the sample at T = 170 and 6 K (Figure 2a,b): i.e. above and below the temperature of the MAPbI3 phase transition (∼160 K) between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively.44,45 In both high-temper- ature tetragonal I4/mcm and low-temperature orthorhombic Pnma phases, MAPbI3 exhibits a robust excitonic response, which manifests itself in the PL spectra as a broad-band angle- independent peak at energies of 1598 and 1655 meV, respectively.
As well, in both phases, the TE-polarized photonic mode exhibits clear anticrossing with the corresponding exciton resonances.
Fitting the dispersions of lower polariton branches (LPB) using the coupled oscillator model46 (Figure 2a,b) allowed us to estimate the Rabi splitting ΩR = 35.2 meV and coupling strength Ω0 = 35.8 meV for the high-temperature tetragonal phase and ΩR = 35.7 meV and Ω0 = 39.2 meV for the low-temperature orthorhombic phase (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 in the Supporting Information for the details).
The extracted Hopfield coefficients |Xk|2 and |Ck|2 representing, respectively, the angular dependence of excitonic and photonic fractions in the polaritons are shown in Figure2c,d.
The estimated values of Ω0 and ΩR for intermediate temperatures are described in Section 7.2 in the Supporting Information.
It is well-known that the linear excitonic response in organic−inorganic lead halide perovskites is strongly affected by the polaron effects.47−49 It thus becomes interesting to investigate how the polaron effects will modify polariton nonlinearities.
To do so, we measure the blueshifts of polariton branches in both crystal phases under resonant femtosecond- pulsed excitation depending on pump fluence and excitonic fraction in the polariton mode, defined by the angle of incidence (Figure 1d).
In the experiment, the laser pump central frequencies and angles of incidence are chosen to resonantly probe each polariton branch with different excitonic fractions, as is shown in Figure 3a,b.
In each measurement, the spectral position of the polariton mode is extracted using Fano line shape fitting of the reflectance spectrum obtained within the spectrum of the pulse (see Section 2.3 in the Supporting Information).
Polariton mode spectra under a resonance pump with fitted Fano line shape at the lowest detuning for 170 and 6 K are shown in Figure 3c,d.
The resulting fluence-dependent polariton mode blueshifts obtained at T = 170 and 6 K for various exciton fractions |Xk|2 are shown in Figure 3e,f.
The most pronounced blueshifts reaching ΔE = 13 meV for T = 170 K and ΔE = 19.7 meV for T = 6 K are expectedly observed at smaller angles of incidence, corresponding to larger exciton fractions |Xk|2.
In both cases, the fluence dependence of the blueshifts is sublinear, clearly demonstrating effects of the saturation similar to those reported for TMD-based samples.18 A careful analysis of the line width of the polariton branch at T = 6 K reveals its broadening at k∥/k0 ≈0.31 (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).
We assume this to be the exciton resonance corresponding to the tetragonal phase, which coexists with the orthorhombic Pnma phase at T = 6 K Figure 3.

2022, 22, 9092−9099 9095in the polycrystalline thin film and is weakly coupled to the photons.45,50 It gives rise to resonant absorption that leads to the reduction of the pump efficiency and, thus, the magnitude of polariton blueshifts observed for kx/k0 = 0.329.
In order to unveil the physical origin of the observed fluence-dependent blueshift of the polariton spectrum, we develop a microscopic model of exciton-polariton response in the considered structure.
Our model includes the quantum mechanical description of exciton−polaron state in MAPbI3 perovskite, the calculation of excitonic nonlinearity rates, the quantitative description of polariton gas temporal dynamics, and the many-body renormalization of polariton resonance energy.
As shown in Figure 3, the calculated spectrum demonstrates an excellent agreement with experimental data.
We attribute the minor deviation observed for low excitonic fractions to the uncertainty in the estimation of the Hopfield coefficients (see Section 2 in the Supporting Information).
The excitonic properties of the considered material are strongly mediated by polaron effects, associated with coupling to the longitudinal optical phonon (LO) mode.48 Indeed, the static dielectric permittivity of MAPbI3 is εs = 25.51 In the 3D hydrogen-like model this corresponds to an exciton binding energy of about 3 meV, which makes excitons even less stable than in GaAs.
In direct contradiction to this, we experimentally found the resonance energies of the exciton transition as EX = 1598 meV in the tetragonal phase and EX = 1655 meV at orthorhombic phase.
This is in perfect agreement with previous measurements,47 where the corresponding exciton binding energies are reported to be Eb = 19 and 25 meV, respectively.
Fixing the high-frequency dielectric permittivity to ε∞= 5 and altering the phonon energy, we reproduce these values within the Pollmann−Büttner model for exciton- polarons44,52 (see Sections 4.1 and 6 in the Supporting Information).
The resulting Bohr radius is on the order of aB ≈ 2.5 nm.
The nonlinear optical response in the regime of strong light−matter coupling is governed by two effects.
The first is a repulsive exciton−exciton exchange interaction, which shifts the position of the excitonic mode with an increase of the pump.
The reduction of the Bohr radius due to the polaronic effects discussed above leads to a decrease of overlap of excitonic wavefunctions and thus to the reduction of exciton− exciton Coulomb interactions calculated within the Born approximation.17 On the other hand, the small radius of the excitons boosts the density of the Mott transition by 1−2 orders of magnitude as compared with conventional semi- conductor materials, such as GaAs.
In turn, this allows reaching the regime of elevated particle densities, where the strong interparticle interactions are quite pronounced and result in particular in potentially giant blueshifts (see Figure 1a).
Thus, the polaron-induced gain in the particle density overcomes the polaron-induced reduction of the Kerr nonlinearity per particle.
The second mechanism of polariton nonlinearity is associated with the composite quantum mechanical statistics of excitons, which leads to the saturation of the optical absorption and corresponding quenching of the Rabi splitting.
This mechanism of optical nonlinearity is inherent for exciton- polaritons and is distinct from the nonlinear response emerging in the domain of other types of polaritons, such as the vibrational polaritons.53−55 We also note that the near- resonant excitation predominantly leads to the formation of exciton-polaritons, with negligible free carrier concentration.
Therefore, we neglect the other third-order nonlinear effects, related to the collective response of free carriers.56,57 Both mechanisms can be treated on an equal footing in the coupled oscillator model, which results in the following expression for the blueshift as a function of the wavevector- resolved polariton density nLk, which can be estimated with use of the input−output formalism: E k n U k n U k n O n ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) LP Lk Lk 2 Lk 2 Lk 3 + (2) Here the expansion coefficients U(k) and U2(k) account for both Coulomb interactions and phase space filling effects and are calculated within the coboson formalism.18,58 Their expressions are given in Section 5.2 in the Supporting Information.
We stress that the nonlinearity associated with the phase space filling scales as aB 3 and under certain conditions is comparable with the Coulomb contribution (see Section 8 and Figure S13 in the Supporting Information).
Notably, the quadratic in density term has an opposite sign as compared to the linear term, which leads to the saturation of the blueshift at elevated densities, as it is indeed in the experiment for both the tetragonal phase (Figure 3e) and the orthorhombic phase (Figure 3f).
The comparison of exciton Coulomb-induced nonlinearity in the two phases and the temperature depend- ence is presented in Sections 6 and 7.1 in the Supporting Information, and the results are summarized in Figures S9 and S10.
In both cases, the reduction of the blueshift with the growth of the wavevector illustrated by Figure 3a,b is caused by the corresponding reduction of the exciton fraction (see Figure 2c,d).
For the orthorhombic phase we report additional suppression of the blueshift observed at intermediate values of the wavevector (red and olive dots in Figure 3f).
We attribute this effect to the residual fraction of the tetragonal phase, having an exciton with reduced oscillator strength lying about 50 meV lower in energy.
The presence of this exciton plays a parasitic role, as it becomes unintentionally excited when pumping near its resonance.
Further details of the theoretical treatment are given in Section 4 in the Supporting Information.
In summary, we have demonstrated the formation of the robust nonlinear polariton response in the patterned bulk hybrid halide perovskite slabs.
It has been shown that polaronic effects stemming from strong exciton−phonon interactions dramatically increase the stability of the excitons in perovskites and enhance the corresponding nonlinear optical properties.
A record high value of 19.7 meV for the polariton blueshift, which is about 50% higher than the values for other materials, has been reported.
The experimental data are in good quantitative agreement with the results of the micro- scopic theoretical treatment.
The observed polaronic enhance- ment of the polariton nonlinear blueshift can be directly expanded to the room-temperature domain for the MAPbBr3 material, supporting a robust exciton−polaron response at room temperature.59 Large values of blueshift allow for the realization of deeper nonlinear potential profiles for polaritons by means of a spatially inhomogeneous pump.
Moreover, since the observed blueshifts are almost equal to the polariton line width, this allows for the realization of nonlinear polariton switches based on perovskite structures.
Our research opens the route to further exploration of the phonon-mediated polariton interactions for future energy-efficient and thermally stable polaritonic devices.

2022, 22, 9092−9099 9096■METHODS Sample Fabrication.
The MAPbI3 thin film was synthesized by a solvent engineering method.60 A solution of the perovskite was prepared in a nitrogen drybox in the following way: 79.5 mg of methylammonium iodide (MAI) from GreatCell Solar and 230.5 mg of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) from TCI was dissolved in 1 mL of a DMF/DMSO solvent mixture in the ratio 9/1.
The resulting 0.5 M solution of MAPbI3 was stirred for 1 day at 27 °C.
Film fabrication was performed in a nitrogen drybox by a spin-coating method.
SiO2 substrates (25 × 25 mm) were washed consecutively with sonication in deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 10 min and afterward cleaned in an oxygen plasma cleaner for 15 min.
The perovskite solution (40 μL) was deposited on the substrate and spin-coated in one step at 4000 rpm for 40 s. At 11 s 500 μL of toluene was dripped on top of the rotating substrate.
The substrate with MAPbI3 at the intermediate phase was placed under vacuum for 3 min at room temperature to evaporate the residues of the solvents and toluene.
The resulting thin film was structured by a nanoimprint lithography method.61 We used a DVD disk grating with a period of 750 nm, a 120 nm ridge height, and a fill factor (dridge/dperiod) of 0.67 as a mold.
The mold was cleaned in methanol and deionized water and then dried before the imprinting.
The imprint process was carried out under 4.8 MPa for 10 min after the mold was removed.
As the adhesion of SiO2 substrates was quite large after the plasma cleaning, no antiadhesive layer was needed.
Imprinted perovskite samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
After the nanoimprint process was finished, a perovskite nanograting was formed with negative replication of the DVD disk mold used.
Optical Measurements.
Angle-resolved reflectance spec- troscopy was performed using a back-focal-plane imaging setup with a slit spectrometer coupled to a liquid-nitrogen-cooled imaging CCD camera (Princeton Instruments SP2500+Py- LoN) and a halogen lamp employed for white-light illumination.
Angle-resolved PL measurements were performed in the same setup with off-resonant excitation by mono- chromatic light from a femtosecond (fs) laser (Pharos, Light Conversion) coupled with a broad-bandwidth optical para- metric amplifier (Orpheus-F, Light Conversion) and com- pressor at a wavelength of 680 nm, 40 fs pulse duration, and 100 kHz repetition rate.
The pulsed regime at 100 kHz was confirmed by the measurements at 1 kHz (see Section 3 in the Supporting Information for details).
For pump-dependent reflectivity measurements, the sample was excited by 40 fs pulses from the same wavelength-tunable laser.
The angle of incidence was controlled via focusing of the laser beam within the back focal plane of the objective lens.
The sample was mounted in an ultralow-vibration closed-cycle helium cryostat (Advanced Research Systems) and maintained at a controllable temperature in the range of 7−300 K. The cryostat was mounted onto a precise XYZ stage for sample positioning.
Spatial filtering in the detection channel was used to avoid parasitic signals originating from the reflections from the optical elements of the setup.
