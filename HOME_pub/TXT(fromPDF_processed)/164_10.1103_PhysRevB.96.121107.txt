DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.96.121107 I. INTRODUCTION Weyl fermions originate from Dirac states by breaking either time-reversal symmetry or space-inversion symmetry [1–12].
In addition to type-I [3,6,10] Weyl points with a close pointlike Fermi surface, novel type-II [4,11] Weyl fermions appear at the boundaries between electron and hole pockets violating Lorentz invariance.
This results in an open Fermi surface and anisotropic chiral anomaly.
Most of the reported type-II Weyl semimetals exhibit characteristic extraordinary magnetoresistance (XMR), observed, for example, in materials that crystallize in the C2/m space group of OsGe2-type structure, such as NbSb2, TaAs2, and NbAs2 [13,14].
WP2 crystallizes the nonsymmorphic space group Cmc21(36), which favors new topological phases with Dirac states [15–18].
Indeed, WP2 was recently predicted to be a type-II Weyl semimetal with four pairs of type-II Weyl points and long topological Fermi arcs [19].
In this work, we have successfully grown single crystals of WP2, and have in- vestigated its magnetotransport properties.
Magnetoresistance (MR = [ρ(B) −ρ(0)]/ρ(0) × 100%) exhibits a nonsaturating ∼H 1.8 ﬁeld dependence up to 14 300% at 2 K and 9 T. WP2 shows a systematic violation of Kohler’s rule and large magnetic-ﬁeld-induced nonmetallic resistivity that cannot be explained by orbital magnetoresistance of multiband metals.
Fermi surface studies of WP2 by quantum oscillations reveal a complex electronic structure.
The T -H phase diagram is consistent with the universal phase diagram for XMR materials [20].
However, the Weyl points in WP2 have little inﬂuence on the effective mass and mobility of the Fermi surfaces detected by quantum oscillations. II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Single crystals of WP2 were grown by chemical vapor transport method using I2 as the transport agent.
First, WP2 polycrystals were obtained by annealing stoichiometric W and P powder at 500 ◦C for 24 h, and then 750 ◦C for 48 h. WP2 polycrystals were mixed with I2 (15 mg/ml), and then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube.
Single crystals were grown in a temperature gradient 1180 ◦C (source) to 1050 ◦C (sink) for a month.
Shiny needlelike single crystals with typical size 1.5 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm were obtained.
X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Rigaku Miniﬂex powder diffractometer.
The element analysis was performed using an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a JEOL LSM 6500 scanning electron microscope.
Heat capacity and magnetotransport measurements up to 9 T were conducted in a Quantum Design PPMS-9.
Magnetotrans- port measurements at high magnetic ﬁelds up to 18 T were conducted at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee.
Resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe conﬁguration.
Hall resistivity was measured by the four-terminal technique by switching the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld to eliminate the contribution of ρxx due to the misalignment of the voltage contacts. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Figure 1(a) shows the powder x-ray diffraction pattern of WP2.
The data can be ﬁtted quite well by the space group Cmc21 with lattice parameter a = 0.3164(2) nm, b = 1.184(2) nm, and c = 0.4980(2) nm, consistent with a previous report [15].
The average atomic ratio determined by the EDX is W : P = 1:2.
Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity in WP2 in different ﬁelds.
The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld is ρ(300 K)/ρ(2 K) = 279 with ρ(2 K) = 0.19 μ cm, indicating small defect scattering in the crystal.

where ρ0 is the residual resistivity and D is the Debye temperature, indicating phonon scattering in the whole temper- ature range.
The ﬁtting results in D = 546(5) K.
As shown in Fig. 1(b), with the application of the magnetic ﬁeld, the ρ(T ) shows a large upturn which saturates below ∼15 K. Similar resistivity behavior was observed recently in XMR materials such as WTe2, TaAs, LaSb, PtSn4, ZrSiSe, and Ta3S2, but also in graphite, bismuth, and MgB2 [22–31].
The heat capacity of WP2, shown in Fig. 1(c), is best described at low temperatures with a C(T )/T = γ + βT 2 + δT 4 where γ = 1.50(5) mJ mol−1 K−1, β = 0.0324(5) mJ mol−1 K−2, and δ = 3.0(2) × 10−5 mJ mol−1 K−4 [Fig. 1(d)] [32].
The Debye temperature D = 564(±11) K is obtained from D = (12π4NR/5β)1/3 where N is the atomic number in the chemical formula and R is the gas constant.
Based on the ﬁeld dependence of ∂ρ/∂T [Fig. 1(e)] we plot the temperature-ﬁeld (T -H) phase diagram in Fig. 1(f), where Tm and Ti are taken as the sign change point and minimum in ∂ρ/∂T .
The phase diagram is consistent with extreme magnetoresistance materials [20].

temperatures with B∥b.
MR exhibits a nonsaturating ∼H 1.8 dependence and reaches 14 300% at 2 K and 9 T. It decreases quickly with increasing temperature, and becomes negligibly small above 100 K. The MR of WP2 is about one order of magnitude smaller than in WTe2 and LaSb, but comparable even larger than those in LaBi, Ta3S2, and TaIrTe4 [22–25,33].
The MR of solids only responds to the extremal cross section of the Fermi surface along the ﬁeld direction.
Thus, angular dependence of MR in a material with a two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface should be proportional to |cos(θ)| [34].
As shown in Fig. 2(b) , MR in different magnetic ﬁelds shows twofold symmetry which can be ﬁtted well with |cos(θ)|, indicating a 2D Fermi surface.
Field-induced nonmetallic resistivity and XMR in topo- logical materials has been discussed lately in the literature; however, its origin was ascribed to different mechanisms.
In WTe2 it was suggested that the band structure of a compensated semimetal with perfect electron-hole symmetry is important, whereas in LaBi and LaSb the proposed mechanism involves a combination of compensated electron-hole pockets and particular orbital texture on the electron pocket [20,35–38].
There is also evidence for exotic and multiple surface Dirac states in other materials.
MR in PtSn4 has been considered within the model of orbital MR in the long mean-free-path metals with single dominant scattering time [28].
However, Dirac node arcs are also found in PtSn4 and ZrSiSe(Te), suggesting that XMR could be connected with suppressed backscattering of Dirac states [39,40].
Semiclassical transport theory based on the Boltzmann equation predicts Kohler’s rule  ρ/ρ(0) = F[H/ρ(0)] to hold if there is a single type of charge carrier and scattering time in a metal [41].
Violation of Kohler’s rule is common in XMR materials, such as LaBi, TaAs, TaAs2, NbAs2, and NbSb2 [13,14,23,42].
As shown in Fig. 2(c), MR in WP2 systematically deviates from Kohler’s rule above 10 K.

The temperature dependence of carrier densities (b) and mobilities (c) of electrons and holes obtained by ﬁtting using the two-band model.
(d) Measured temperature dependence of ρ(T,B) at various ﬁelds (solid lines), and ρ(T,B) calculated using the temperature dependence of ne,h and μe,h derived from the two-band model (scatter symbols).
ﬁeld dependence of MR at different temperatures can be well ﬁtted with MR = A × H n; n is 1.8 at 2 K. The exponent n systematically decreases to 1.5 with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 2(d).
The temperature evolutions of A and n are similar to the temperature dependence of MR(9 T).
A common violation of Kohler’s rule in metals is multiband electronic transport, i.e., the existence of multiple scattering times.
WP2 was predicted to be a type-II Weyl semimetal; therefore there is a possibility that high mobility bands with Dirac states contribute to small residual resistivity in zero magnetic ﬁeld and strong magnetoresistance.
In the two-band model MR is [43] MR = neμenhμh(μe + μh)2(μ0H)2 (μenh + μhne)2 + (μhμe)2(μ0H)2(nh −ne)2 .
For the compensated semimetal, where ne ≃nh, we obtain MR = μeμh(μ0H)2, since the MR = A × H n (n = 1.5–1.8) [Fig. 2(c)] compensated two-band model cannot completely explain the MR.
Next, we discuss electronic transport in WP2 from the perspective of the two-band model when ne ̸= nh.
Figure 3(a) shows the ﬁeld dependence of Hall resistivity ρxy at different temperatures.
Clear quantum oscillations were observed at low temperatures.
The frequencies and effective mass derived from ρxy are consistent with that of ρxx, and we discuss this below.
The ρxy can be ﬁtted by the two-band model: ρxy μ0H = RH = 1 e (μ2 hnh −μ2 ene) + (μhμe)2(μ0H)2(nh −ne) (μenh + μhne)2 + (μhμe)2(μ0H)2(nh −ne)2 , where ne (nh) and μe (μh) denote the carrier concentrations and mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively.
We ﬁnd that ρxy can be well ﬁtted by the two-band model.
The obtained ne (nh) and μe (μh) by ﬁtting are shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively.
WP2 shows relatively high carrier density and the dominant carrier is electronlike.
The mobility is similar to other Dirac materials such as AMnBi2 (A = Sr, Ca), LaBi, and doped WTe2 [23,44–46].
The large carrier density indicates that WP2 is different from a compensated semimetal.
We calculate the ρ(T,B) using carrier concentrations ne (nh) and mobilities μe (μh) obtained by a two-band model ﬁtting of ρxy, as shown in Fig. 3(d).
A similar temperature dependence between calculated and measured MR argues in favor of the va- lidity of multicarrier electronic transport [Fig. 3(d)].
However, in contrast to LaBi, the ρ(T,B) from two-band orbital mag- netoresistance is several orders of magnitude smaller than the measured ρ(T,B).
When considering the multiband behavior, further ﬁts of ρxy using a three-band model [47] reproduced ρxy equally well.
Moreover, nearly identical MR is obtained.
Therefore, in either case multiband MR is much smaller than experiment results.
This suggests possible contribution beyond the conventional orbital magnetoresistance that ampliﬁes MR.
MR for H∥b, and cantilver for H∥a at different temper- atures up to 18 T are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
MR shows nonsaturating H n up to 18 T, consistent with the results in Fig. 2.
Clear oscillations were observed above 10 T. The oscillatory components are plotted as a function of 1/B in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d).
Both Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) exhibit beat patterns, indicating that multiple frequencies contribute to oscillations.
The fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra of the oscillatory components are shown in Figs. 4(e) and 4(f).
Four frequencies are observed in Fig. 4(e): 1384, 1799, 3183, and 3806 T. There are several peaks around Fα = 1384 T, suggesting the contribution of several extrema.
According to the calculated Fermi surface of WP2 [19,48], Fα = 1384 T and Fβ = 1799 T can be ascribed to hole pockets, and Fγ = 3183 T and Fη = 3806 T are from electron pockets.
From the Onsager relation, F = (0/2π2)AF, where 0 is the ﬂux quantum and AF is the orthogonal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface, the Fermi surface is estimated to be 13, 17, 30, and 36 nm−2, corresponding to 5%, 7%, 12%, and 14% of the total area of the Brillouin zone in the ac plane.
Assuming the circular cross section of Fermi surface AF = πk2 F, the band splitting induced by spin-orbital coupling can be estimated to be kγ −kη = 0.03 ˚A −1, which is larger than that in MoP, and about half of that in giant Rashba effect material BiTeI [49,50].
Strong spin-orbital coupling in WP2 indicates that spin texture, which could forbid backscattering, might play an important role in large magnetoresistance, similar to that in WTe2 [51].
For de Haas–van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation along the a axis, the Fermi surfaces from three frequencies 1217, 2949, and 3417 T are 12, 28, and 32, corresponding to 18%, 42%, and 48% of the Brillouin zone.
In order to obtain the cyclotron mass for the main frequencies, the FFT amplitude A versus temperature was ﬁtted using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula [34], A ∼[αm∗(T /B)/ sinh(αm∗T /B)] where α = 2π2kB/e¯h ≈ 14.69 T/K and m∗= m/me is the cyclotron mass ratio (me is the mass of free electron).
As shown in Figs. 4(e) and 4(f), the cyclotron mass along the b axis is close to the mass of free electron me, while the cyclotron mass along the a axis is reduced to about 0.5me, which can be attributed to anisotropy of the Fermi surface.
We estimate the Dingle temperatures from the FFT frequency with highest FFT peaks to be 2.4 and 4.7 K for H∥b and H∥a, respectively.

scattering times are 5.0 × 10−13 s and 2.6 × 10−13 s.
Then, the mobility estimated by μq = eτq/mc is 880 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 458 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to Fig. 3(c).
The effective mass and mobility suggest that the Fermi surfaces detected by quantum oscillation are not under signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the Weyl points which are located below the Fermi level [19].
The angle dependence of Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) in the bc plane, and dHvA in the ac plane provides further insight into the shape of the Fermi surface.
The FFT spectra of the SdH is presented in Fig. 5(a), and dHvA in Fig. 5(b).
For the SdH measurement, four main peaks are observed; the FFT peaks increase with the angle tilt from zero, and disappear above 60◦.
The solid lines in Fig. 5(c) are ﬁtted using the 2D Fermi surface [F(0)/cos(θ)].
Hence low angle quantum oscillations reveal quasi-2D character at low angles below 50◦.

the a axis, the frequency decreases with the angle, indicating the elongated Fermi surface in the bc plane.
The angle depen- dence of quantum oscillations agree well with the calculated Fermi surface [19,48].
The calculated Fermi surfaces of WP2 consist of spaghetti-like hole Fermi surfaces and bow-tie-like electron Fermi surfaces, while the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling leads to splitting of Fermi surfaces [19,48].
The spaghetti-like hole Fermi surface extends along the b axis, bends along the a axis, while it is ﬂat along the c axis, consistent with the quasi-2D elongated α and β bands in the bc plane.
When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied in small angles around the b axis, SdH oscillations of γ and η bands are from 121107-4RAPID COMMUNICATIONS LARGE MAGNETORESISTANCE IN THE TYPE-II WEYL . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 96, 121107(R) (2017) the orbits across whole electron pockets in the ac plane, and the quasi-2D behavior of γ and η bands can then be attributed to the relatively ﬂat wall of electron pockets.
Moreover, the appearance in pairs of both the hole and electron Fermi surfaces with almost the same angle dependence might be the result of the band splitting effect which is induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. IV.
CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, magnetotransport studies of WP2 conﬁrm the presence of multiple bands [19].
The large increase of resistivity in magnetic ﬁeld cannot be explained by the multiband orbital magnetoresistance but the effective mass and mobility detected by quantum oscillations are not under signiﬁcant inﬂuence of Weyl points.
A strong spin-orbit coupling effect was observed in quantum oscillations, whereas the temperature and angle dependence of quantum oscillation measurements reveal anisotropic multiband characteristics and are in agreement with calculations.
Even though the crystal structure in WP2 is not layered as in transition-metal dichalcogenides, Fermi surfaces do show partial quasi-2D character. Note added.
Recently, a related study on WP2 was reported by Schönemann et al. [52]; although the magnitude of magne- toresistance and RRR of the crystal is somewhat different, the Fermi surface and main conclusion are consistent with ours.
