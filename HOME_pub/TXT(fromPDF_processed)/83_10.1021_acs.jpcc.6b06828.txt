Understanding nanoscale optical behavior of the edges and grain boundaries of  synthetically grown TMDCs is vital for optimizing their optoelectronic properties.
Elucidating the nanoscale optical properties of 2D materials through far-field optical  microscopy requires a diffraction-limited optical beam diameter sub-micron in size.
Here  we present our experimental work on spatial photoluminescence (PL) scanning of large  size (≥ 50 µm) monolayer MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a  diffraction limited blue laser beam spot (wavelength 405 nm) with a beam diameter as  small as ∼200 nm allowing us to probe nanoscale excitonic phenomena which was not  observed before.
We have found several important features: (i) there exists a sub- micron width strip (~500 nm) along the edges that fluoresces ~1000% brighter than the  region far inside; (ii) there is another brighter wide region consisting of parallel  Page 1 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 602  fluorescing lines ending at the corners of the zig-zag peripheral edges; (iii) there is a  giant blue shifted A-excitonic peak, as large as ∼120 meV, in the PL spectra from the  edges.
Using density functional theory calculations, we attribute this giant blue shift to  the adsorption of oxygen impurities at the edges, which reduces the excitonic binding  energy.
Our results not only shed light on defect-induced excitonic properties, but also  offer an attractive route to tailor optical properties at the TMDC edges through defect  engineering.

These  extraordinary properties make TMDCs very attractive for optoelectronic applications1, 5-9  including low power transistors,10 sensitive photodetectors,5, 11-13 energy harvesting devices,14-16  atomically thin LEDs,6, 8-9 single photon sources17-21 and nanocavity lasers.22 To realize TMDCs  for practical application, we need to understand the optical properties of edges, which become  dominant as devices shrink to nanoscale.23 The edges are also important for photocatalytic,  electrocatalytic and hydrodesulfphurization process.24 In addition to the atomic edges, other structural defects may also have pronounced effects.
Recent advances in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have allowed batch production of  monolayer TMDCs with macroscopic size and uniform atomic thickness.25-28 However, these  synthesized films are polycrystalline in nature largely because of the coalescence of disoriented  domains,29-31, which affect their electrical32-33 and optical properties.30 It is therefore of paramount  importance to understand the optical properties of the edges of these misoriented domains.
So  far the far-field optical properties of TMDCs have been studied using conventional scanning  micro-photoluminescence (µPL) microscopy that employs micron sized or larger optical  beams34-39 lacking sufficient resolution to probe the optical properties of the edges and the grain  boundaries.
Here we report our study using a scanning far-field PL mapping employing an ultra-narrow  optical beam (~200 nm) that has allowed us to observe three important excitonic features at the  atomic edges and the grain boundaries of large size chemical vapor deposited (CVD) grown  Page 3 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 604  large monolayer-MoS2 (1L-MoS2) flakes.
First, there exists a submicron (width ~500 nm) narrow  strip of higher fluorescent region at the outermost edges of monolayer MoS2 flakes.
Second,  there is a wide (~5-10 µm) fluorescent region just inside the peripheral edge, comprised of  multiple parallel submicron fluorescent lines.
Finally, the A-exciton originating from both the  single crystalline edges and polycrystalline boundaries is significantly blue shifted (~120 meV)  relative to interior fluorescence.
Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we  attribute the giant blue shift phenomenon of the A-exciton to the reduced screening strength  originating from the adsorption of oxygen dimers at the edges and grain boundaries.
Our study  not only elucidates the intricate defect-related luminescence properties in the edges, but also  provides a pathway, through defect engineering, for the next generation of optical and  optoelectronic devices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:   Sample growth: Large flakes of 1L-MoS2 were synthesized from solid S and MoO3 precursors  directly onto SiO2 on Si, utilizing a seed layer of perylene-3,4,9,10 tetracarboxylic acid  tetrapotassium salt (PTAS).27, 40 We utilized elevated temperature (850 ºC) and atmospheric  pressure to encourage epitaxial growth, which can result in single-crystal domains in excess of  200 µm on an edge (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information).
The layer thickness of the grown  sample was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy41-43 and atomic force microscopy (see  supplementary information).27, 44  A direct comparison of CVD grown and exfoliated 1L-MoS2 via  PL and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the CVD grown samples are of high quality  (see Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information).
Computational Methods: The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out  using the VASP package.45 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient  approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation potential46 was used, and the electron-core  interactions were treated in the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.47-48 All the  Page 4 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 605  calculations have been performed using a MoS2 nanoribbon with a length of 5.2 nm.
The length  of the supercell along the periodic direction is 1.3 nm.
Structures have been optimized using a  single Γ point of the Brillouin zone with a kinetic cut off energy of 400 eV. The structure was fully  relaxed until atomic forces were smaller than 0.02 eV Å-1.
In these calculations, the spin-orbit  interaction has not been taken into account, since we focused on the shift of the energy bands  while the valence bands splitting is expected to remain the same.
When calculating the  formation energy of oxygen impurities, the experimental value of gas-phase O2 binding energy  is used as the reference49.
Confocal PL imaging: We conducted high resolution PL scanning using a laser scanning  confocal microscope (Zeiss 710 Axiovert) with an oil objective of high numerical aperture  (NA=1.4).
Here we raster scanned a focused excitation laser (λ~ 405 nm) over the sample and  Figure 1: (a) The experimental setup is shown schematically (not to scale).
The sample was  covered by water and encapsulated by a cover slip (thickness~0.17 mm).

The sample was covered by a thin film of water,  encapsulated by a cover slip, as shown schematically in Figure 1a.
We successfully focused the  beam to a spot size of diameter ~200 nm, i.e. the beam area is ~25 times smaller than the  micron sized beam area used in scanning PL system conventionally used to study TMD  samples.34-39 The beam diameter was confirmed with a calibrated fluorescent bead of diameter  200 nm (see Supporting Information), and all measurements were conducted at room  temperature.
The power intensity of the laser was ~3 mW and the dwell time at each pixel~100  µs.
The reflection image of one of the 1L-MoS2 sample is shown in Figure 1b.
The darker region  on the flake is originating from bilayer spots.
We have studied in total 11 samples and all  demonstrate similar results (see Supporting Information).
Since this high resolution microscopy  requires a thin aqueous layer between a cover slip and the sample, all measurements were  carried out in air at room temperature.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  High resolution fluorescence image of a large triangular 1L-MoS2 sample is shown in Figure 2a.
In all the previous studies, the researchers have reported a wide region of fluorescence at the  edges.30, 50 What is unique in our high resolution spatial mapping is that we successfully  resolved the fluorescing regions near the edges and found that the brighter edges actually  consists of two distinct regions of brighter intensity.
First, our spatial mapping shows a submicron fluorescent strip of width ~500 nm along the flake  edge.
The intensity profile along a line drawn across this strip is shown inset in Figure 2b, and  reveals fluorescence intensities of ~400% higher than inner regions.
For three samples, we  observed edge fluorescence intensity ~1000% larger than interior (see Supporting Information).
This extraordinarily large spike in intensity may arise from point defects, which can trap free  Page 6 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 607  charge carriers and localized excitons.51 Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it has  been demonstrated that point defects, such as S vacancies, could form at flake edges.52-53   Second, our spatial PL mapping shows another wider band along the edges consisting of  parallel fluorescent lines(as marked by arrows in Figure 2b).
Interestingly, these parallel lines  originate from the zig-zag corners of the periphery, as is clearly visible in the blow-up image  presented in Figure 2b.
These fluorescent parallel lines have a spatial width of ~500nm and  fluoresce with intensity ~100% higher than neighboring spots.
We suggest that these  fluorescent lines originate from line defects, which are boundaries between two opposite  rotation domains of the 3-fold symmetric MoS2 lattice, as has been observed in STM  measurements of physical vapor deposited MoS2 on Au (111) substrate,54 and scanning  Figure 2: (a) The fluorescence image of a 1L-MoS2 flake.

This suggests that,  although the reflection image of a 1L-MoS2 shows seamless integration into a single crystalline  entity (as in Figure 1b), the flake actually consists of multiple domains, as evidenced by the  fluorescing line defects along grain boundaries.
Brighter luminescence from the defects  suggests that these line defects may trap excitons and similar to the point defects at the  periphery.
To understand the origin of the brighter edges, we have further investigated wavelength- resolved PL scans of our 1L-MoS2 samples.
After pumping the flakes with a ~405 nm laser, we  observed a major luminescence peak shift across the sample, ranging from 660 nm at the edge  to 710 nm further inwards.
This peak in PL, also known as A-exciton peak (A-peak), has been  attributed to the recombination of photoexcited excitons across the direct band gap at the K- point.2, 4 The spatial mapping of the wavelength values of the A-peak for that same large  triangular flake and another polycrystalline sample are shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3c-d,  respectively.
Figure 3b shows the PL spectra of two locations in the sample shown in Figure 3a,  one at the periphery, the other just inside.
Here the peak positions were obtained by fitting the  PL data for every pixel using a Gaussian profile.
For the pixels for which Gaussian fitting was  not possible, i.e., for the pixel outside the flake, the color was set to white.
A very strong blue  shifted A-peak is observed at the flake edges relative to interior.
The maximum energy of the  edge A-peak is ~1.89 eV (~656 nm) and the minimum energy of the interior A-peak is 1.77 eV  (~703 nm).
This is a total upshift of ~120 meV, approximately ~3 times larger than previously  reported values50.
We have not observed any dependence of PL blue shift and intensity on the  flake size (see supplementary Fig.S6).
To investigate the effect of the beam diameter on the PL mapping, we varied laser beam size.
We observed the upshift values decrease significantly as we employed a wider beam spot;  Page 8 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 609  specifically, the blue shift decreased to ~ 20 meV as we doubled the beam diameter (from 200  to 400 nm).
For a few micron sized beam, there was no observable blue shift.

We will now discuss possible origins of our observations of giant blue shifts of A-exciton peaks.
Various studies have shown that large shifts of the A-exciton peak can originate from edge  stress or compression,55-58 neutral exction-trion population50, spatial confinement59 or defects.60- 62 Specifically, it has been experimentally demonstrated that compressive strain can lead to a  blue shift in the A-exciton peak;58 and furthermore, DFT calculations have predicted that the  edges of MoS2 flakes are in fact naturally compressed relative to the inside.63 Hence, the  presence of compressive strain at the edges can cause a blue shift in the A-peak.
The Raman  spectrum from the edges demonstrates a slight compressive strain (~0.1%), which will cause a  blue shift of the A- exciton only by ~ 5meV (see Fig.S4 in the Supporting Information).64 Furthermore to examine the effects of edge strain on our observed optical properties, we also  studied the spatial scanning of PL for several 1L-MoS2 samples prepared by microexfoliation,  and did not observe any blue-shifted edges as shown in Fig.3e-f.
We have examined more than  five microexfoliated 1L-MoS2 samples and observed similar results.
Thus, we argue, the  observed giant blue shift of the A-peak cannot be due to compressive strain at the edges.
Observed giant blue shift of the A-exciton can also arise from the competition between trion and  neutral exciton population.
Since we have observed much larger blue shift than the binding  energy (~20 meV) of the trions, we can safely rule out that the observed giant blue shift is  originating from the relative competition between trion and neutral exciton population.
It has been demonstrated that spatial confinement reduces screening strength and increases  the Coulomb interaction and exciton binding energy.59, 65 Hence, it is expected that spatial  confinement at the edges of 1L-MoS2  would modify the exciton binding energy and luminescing  photon energy.
The width of region for which the A-peak has been blue shifted, however, is ~  500 nm, very large compared to the physical size of the excitons (~1-3 nm).53 Moreover, we  Page 10 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 6011  have not observed any blue shift for the A-exciton in the microexfoliated samples, where  excitons will encounter similar edge confinement.
Thus, it is unlikely that the large blue shift  originates from the spatial confinement at the edge.
Now we will concentrate on edge defects, and how they can modify the PL A-peak as well as  fluorescence intensity.
Edge defects were explored using first-principles DFT calculations (See  details in Methods).
To model the flakes used in the experiments, here we used a nano ribbon  that is periodic in one direction with a finite width in the other.
All the calculations have been  performed using a MoS2 nanoribbon with a width of 5.2 nm.
The width is long enough to  eliminate the effect of the edges on the middle of the ribbon, as shown by the converged DOS  when moving from the edge towards the middle in Figure 4b (top panel).
The MoS2 nanoribbons used in our calculations are shown in Figure 4a and 4c.
The ribbon was  terminated by two edges, the S-edge and the Mo-edge.
Previous studies of MoS2 nanocrystals  using atomic resolution STM have shown that both edges may be present.53, 66-67 The Mo edge  exhibits a specific metallic electronic structure and has been shown to dominate in triangular  MoS2 nanocrystals supported on Au(111) surface.68 The Mo edge has been shown to be the key  active site for hydrogen evolution reaction69 and hydrodesulfurization reaction.70 Figure 4b(top)  shows the projected density of states (PDOS) of each Mo atom across the nanoribbons since  the d states of the Mo atoms dominate the band edge states.
The two edges show some  metallic character in agreement with a previous STM study.68 When moving towards the middle  of the ribbon, there is less difference between the Mo atoms, all of which converge to the bulk  electronic structure.

The oxidation of the edges has also  been reported experimentally in STM measurements of air-exposed monolayer WSe2.71 The X- ray Photoelectron spectroscopy data from a thick MoS2 sample suggests that oxygen molecules  can be absorbed at the cracks and vacancies.61 Previous calculations suggested local strain at  the grain boundaries in a 1L layered materials might also attract and accumulate oxygen.72 Here  we studied oxygen dimer, which forms by dissociation of an oxygen molecule at a sulfur  vacancy, it is more energetically favorable by 0.6 eV at the Mo-edge and 0.4 eV at the S-edge  as compared to the middle of the ribbon (Figure 4c), which indicates a non-homogeneous  distribution of oxygen dimers.

A more pronounced  electronic resonance from the edge atom (index n = 18) is caused by the oxygen dimer, which  introduces more valence electrons than the replaced S atom that previously occupied the  position.
In addition, there is  a gradual downshift of the valence band with respect to the Fermi  level when moving towards the Mo-edge as schematically shown in Figure 4d.
This downshift of  the valence bands is caused by a surface dipole resulting from the oxygen-induced charge  redistribution, which is also shown by the change of the local electrostatic potential plotted 3.5 Å  above the MoS2 surface (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).
The change of the local  electrostatic potential remains the same when increasing the vacuum layer further to 5 nm (see  Fig. S9).
The correlation between the increased electron density, which is mainly localized at  the edge of the ribbon, suggested by the calculations and the blue shift of the PL at the edges  found experimentally suggests that enhanced screening of the excited electron from its  counterpart – the remaining hole in the valence band – may lead to a reduced exciton binding  energy, and provides an explanation for the blue shift of the PL peak at the edges.
The long- range screening effect extends to a distance of about 500 nm, as shown by the blue-shifted A- peak.
However, the ground state DFT calculations cannot resolve the dependence of the  screening effect on the distance from the metallic edge.
We find that an oxygen monomer, instead of an oxygen dimer, at the S vacancy causes similar  change of the electronic structure (Fig. S10).
The calculated energy gain to incorporate an  oxygen atom at a sulfur vacancy at the Mo edge is 4.8 eV, while the energy gain for an oxygen  dimer is 4.5 eV per O. We find that substitutional oxygen has little variation in formation energy  across the ribbon, however, preference of formation of sulfur vacancy at the edges may drive  non-homogeneous distribution of sulfur vacancies and also substitutional oxygen monomers.
The similar energy gain for incorporation of oxygen monomer and dimer suggests that oxygen  may exist as dimers at low concentration of sulfur vacancies, while oxygen monomer may  Page 13 of 29 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 6014  dominate at high concentration of sulfur vacancies due to diffusion of oxygen atoms.
Intriguingly, our findings using a far-field optical microscope involving a ultra-narrow beam  is  very different from results recently reported by Bao et al.50 using a ~60 nm diameter beam in a  near-field scanning optical microscope setup.
First, we have observed larger (~2.5 times) blue  shift of the A-excitons at the periphery.
Second, we have observed exciton-enhancing  luminescence at the periphery in agreement to other studies30, whereas Bao et al., observed  exciton-quenching luminescence.
Though not understood currently, the discrepancies may be  attributed to different sample growth procedures and different sizes of the samples (our samples  are at least one order larger), both of which may affect the defect concentration and in turn the  PL measurement.
CONCLUSIONS In summary, we obtained ultra-high resolution fluorescence imaging and spatial mapping of 1L- MoS2 using a narrow optical beam and found several important characteristics at the edges.
We  observed a strip of brighter fluorescence at the outermost edge, and another wide region of  brighter luminescence consisting of submicron parallel lines originating from sharp zig-zig  corners due to line defects.
The latter suggests that large flakes are in fact polycrystalline at the  edges.
Moreover, we observed a giant blue shifted A-exciton peak at the edges.
Through DFT  calculations, we have attributed this blue shift to the absorption of oxygen impurities at the  edges, which reduces the binding energy of the exciton, resulting in a blue shifted A-exciton  peak.
Our results are important for  informing the design of next generation truly nanoscale or  atomic scale optical and optoelectronic devices, since edge effects become dominant as  devices reduce in size to the nanoscale.
