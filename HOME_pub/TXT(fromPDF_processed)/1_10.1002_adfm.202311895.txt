Introduction In materials with magnetic atoms sit- ting in geometrically frustrated lattices, multiple ordered states exhibiting dis- tinct symmetries can possess comparable energies related to inter-site antiferro- magnetic (AFM) exchange interactions.
The concept of geometric frustration fre- quently intersects with broader notions in condensed matter physics encompass- ing quantum spin liquids, topological states, and critical behavior.[1‚Äì3] Over recent decades, the deliberate manipulation of magnetic states in collinear antiferromag- nets has garnered considerable attention, primarily driven by advancements in AFM spintronics.[4,5] Hence, research eÔ¨Äorts have been directed toward the controlled manipulation of antiferromagnets us- ing diverse methods, including electrical means,[6‚Äì8] structural alterations,[9‚Äì11] high magnetic Ô¨Åelds,[12] and interaction with neighboring ferromagnetic layers.[13] L.

Frustrated antiferromagnets, while inherently fascinating,[14] have yet to gain practical signiÔ¨Åcance.
Exploring ways to con- trol single-site anisotropy in these materials, possibly through strain engineering, could boost their practical applications.
To il- lustrate the principle of switching between AFM states of diÔ¨Äer- ent symmetries in frustrated magnets, we utilize uranium diox- ide (UO2), a principal nuclear fuel material, as a model system.
In UO2‚Äôs face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, magnetic frustration arises from the energy degeneracy of three AFM states (Figure 1a (bottom)), inÔ¨Çuenced by relativistic inter-site AFM exchange A.

CaciuÔ¨Äo National Institute of Nuclear Physics Genoa Section, Genova I-16146, Italy interactions.[15] The nature of UO2‚Äôs magnetic ground state has puzzled scientists for decades.[16] Initial neutron diÔ¨Äraction mea- surements in the 1960s suggested a collinear 1k AFM[17,18] struc- ture (Figure 1a (top)) below the Ô¨Årst-order transition at the N√©el temperature TN = 30.8 K. In the 1970s, the occurrence of a dy- namical Jahn‚ÄìTeller (J‚ÄìT) distortion above the phase transition temperature was proposed.[19] Subsequent neutron diÔ¨Äraction studies unveiled the presence of a static J‚ÄìT distortion at TN, hint- ing at a noncollinear 2k AFM order in UO2.[20,21] Eventually,[22] the exotic transverse 3k magnetic ordering, a superposition of three individual 1k structures in the cubic unit cell, with ura- nium magnetic moments of ‚âà1.74(2) ŒºB pointing in the <111> directions (Figure 1a (bottom)) was revealed.
Resonant x-ray scat- tering experiments further provided evidence[23] of long-range antiferro-ordering of electric-quadrupole moments at the ura- nium site.
The ground state triplet of the U4+ ion in the cubic crystal Ô¨Åeld of UO2 is spherically symmetric, resulting in exactly zero single- ion anisotropy in the cubic phase.[15] The energy degeneracy be- tween the states within the fcc lattice is lifted[24,25] by higher rank inter-site exchange interactions of relativistic origin that couple quadrupole moments and stabilize[24] the 3k order in cubic UO2.
Here, we demonstrate that an eÔ¨Äective switching between the Adv. Funct. Mater.

In UO2 thin Ô¨Ålms strain can induce ferromagnetism by in- corporating point defects and generating hypo- (x < 0) or hyper- (x > 0) stoichiometric UO2+x.[26] In this study, we apply epitax- ial strain through substrate selection and switch between AFM structures in stoichiometric UO2 Ô¨Ålms.
Determining the exact type of AFM ordering in UO2 Ô¨Ålms is challenging, requiring a large amount of material[22] and a sophisticated neutron experi- ment.
Such a determination has not yet been made for any UO2 thin Ô¨Ålm.
Instead, we utilize the exchange-bias (EB)[27] eÔ¨Äect‚Äôs magnitude in UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers to indirectly probe the AFM state in UO2.
The EB magnitude signiÔ¨Åcantly varies depending on the substrate used for growing the UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers.
Em- ploying many-body Ô¨Årst-principles calculations based on charge self-consistent DFT+Hubbard-I (HI) approximation[28‚Äì30] and a force-theorem-HI (FT-HI) approach[31] for inter-site exchange, we predict that tetragonal distortion leads to a transition in UO2 from transverse 3k magnetic order to transverse 1k magnetic or- der.
The experimental observation of exchange bias in the bilay- ers UO2/Fe3O4 supports the notion that epitaxial strain serves as a crucial control parameter in determining the UO2‚Äôs AFM structure.
2. Result and Discussion 2.1.
Structural and Magnetic Characterization of Thin Films We have previously observed[32] a signiÔ¨Åcant exchange bias eÔ¨Äect in LaAlO3(LAO)-based UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers when they were Ô¨Åeld- cooled below the N√©el temperature of UO2.
The EB arises from the interfacial exchange coupling between the AFM UO2 and the ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, leading to a shift in the magnetic hystere- sis loop.
While exchange bias is typically attributed to interface phenomena, previous studies have indicated[33] that the mecha- nisms behind EB, which are not yet fully understood, can also be inÔ¨Çuenced by the spin conÔ¨Ågurations of the bulk AFM material.
In our current study, we utilized this property to investigate the dependence of EB on the thickness of UO2 while introducing the strain in UO2.
For the sample preparation, we have chosen the substrates due to the following considerations.
UO2 has a lattice constant a0 of 5.469 √Ö at room temperature.
CaF2 is isostructural to UO2 with lattice parameter a0 = 5.462 √Ö (lattice mismatch of 0.1%).
For the (001) LaAlO3 substrates with lattice parameter a0 = 3.821 √Ö, the epitaxial relationship with UO2 would be such that the (110) plane of UO2 (d-spacing a0/‚àö2 = 3.867 √Ö) Ô¨Åts with the LaAlO3 (100) plane, thus producing a small compression of UO2 of ‚àí1.2% with respect to the substrate in-plane spacing.
Indeed, an x-ray diÔ¨Äraction (XRD) study conÔ¨Årmed that the UO2 lay- ers grow in the [001] direction on both types of substrates, CaF2 (001) and LaAlO3 (001).
Bulk magnetite Fe3O4 (fcc structure with space group Fd-3m) has a lattice parameter of 8.39 √Ö.
We Ô¨Ånd that Fe3O4 grows on UO2 with an [111]-out-of plane orienta- tion (Figure 1b).
Figure 1c,d demonstrates the stacking sequence for the UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers on substrates (001) CaF2 and (001) LaAlO3, respectively (the hexagonal Mg capping layer with basal planes parallel to the surface is not shown).
Magnetic hysteresis loops for both series of samples were mea- sured after Ô¨Åeld cooling through the N√©el temperature of UO2 in a 10 kOe magnetic Ô¨Åeld applied in the in-plane direction of the bilayers (Figure 2a).
We determined the exchange bias ef- fect as HEB = |(|HC‚àí| ‚àíHC+)|/2, where, HC‚àí(HC+) is the co- ercive Ô¨Åeld on the descending (ascending) branch of the hys- teresis loop.
The exchange bias reaches Àú2000 Oe in the CaF2- based system.
Surprisingly, we Ô¨Ånd that the LAO-based sam- ples demonstrate a twice weaker EB as compared to the CaF2- based bilayers at all thicknesses of UO2 (Figure 2b).
Given that the strength of exchange coupling in the exchange-biased sys- tem is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ferro- (or fer- rimagnetic in our case) magnetic counterpart of the bilayers as HEB‚àº1/ùúèF,[27] the fact that in both systems the Fe3O4 layers pos- sess similar thicknesses and have identical structural character- istics (as detailed in Figures S4, S5, and S9, Supporting Informa- tion) fails to account for the observed twofold diÔ¨Äerence in the EB magnitude.
Another factor that could potentially explain the diÔ¨Äerence lies in the presence of distinct variations in the stoichiometry of the UO2 layer and/or the morphology of the UO2/Fe3O4 in- terface.
The former was shown[26] to be responsible for ferro- magnetism in the UO2+x thin Ô¨Ålms by incorporating point de- fects.
Hence, the stoichiometry of the UO2 layers was closely monitored after depositing each layer.
In particular, we controlled the position and width of the main U-4f peaks and high-energy side satellite line relative to an associated primary U-4f5/2 peak (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
This approach is indepen- dent of the absolute binding energy and is particularly useful for distinguishing the oxidation states of uranium.[34] Addition- ally, we ensured the absence of any foreign structures in the XPS spectra.
The observed values for UO2 were in line with the literature[34] for both types of substrates.
(As a point of compari- son: in the case of hyperstoichiometric UO2+x thin Ô¨Ålm samples investigated in Ref.
[26], the associated photoemission study doc- umented in Ref.
[35] indicated that the satellite peaks are scarcely visible).
The quality of the interface was assessed using Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS); the recorded well-separated spectra from U and Fe revealed no chemical intermixing between the magnetic layers within experimental resolution (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The sharpness of the interface be- tween the UO2 layer and the substrates was further validated by the presence of distinct thickness fringes observed around the UO2 peaks in the XRD data (Figure 1b and Figure S7, Supporting Information).
These observations are entirely con- sistent with the Ô¨Åndings from our previous transmission elec- tron microscopy (TEM) study of the LAO-based UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers.[32] To provide a more in-depth characterization of the UO2/Fe3O4 samples‚Äô crystal structure, we recorded Reciprocal Space Maps (RSM) in the vicinity of characteristic symmetric and asymmet- ric peaks of UO2 on both types of substrates (see Figure 3).
The simulated lattice parameters of the UO2 layer are given in Figure 4.
Our results reveal a negligible lateral strain in the UO2 homogeneous epitaxial layer when deposited on CaF2.
The UO2 layer on the LAO substrate is in-plane compressively strained.
The substrate-induced tetragonality (with its measure depicted in the upper part of Figure 4) or strain in UO2 decreases with the Adv. Funct. Mater.

increasing layer thickness and approaches a certain residual value given by diÔ¨Äerent thermal expansions of the substrate and the layer during the post-growth cooling.
This is consistent with data obtained by Bao et al.[36] who employed resonant x-ray scat- tering (RXS) to study UO2 thin Ô¨Ålms deposited on the LAO and CaF2 substrates and observed strain-induced tetragonal distor- tion with a mosaicity of ‚âà1¬∞ in the LAO-based UO2 Ô¨Ålms.
For the record, in some of the CaF2-based layers, we also ob- served a noticeable tetragonal distortion, most likely induced dur- ing the cooling process after Ô¨Ålm deposition.
The exchange bias in these samples immediately decreased to values similar to those observed in the LAO-based system (Figure S10, Supporting In- formation).
On the other hand, in one of the CaF2-based sam- ples, we noticed a signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller lattice parameter of UO2 with ùúèAF = 85 √Ö (Figure 4), probably due to a slight oxygen de- Ô¨Åciency in the sample.
However, the UO2 layer in this sample remained cubic, and the resulting exchange bias was found to be of similar magnitude, ‚âà2000 Oe, as in the stoichiometric sam- ples.
This aligns with the general understanding of the robust- ness of antiferromagnetism in bulk UO2: bulk oÔ¨Ä-stoichiometric UO2¬±x remains antiferromagnetic for small deviations of x < 0.07.[37,38] Below, we show by Ô¨Årst-principles calculations that even a slight tetragonal distortion of the initial fcc structure can induce a single-ion anisotropy in strained UO2.
Consequently, the altered arrangement of moments within the Ô¨Ålm‚Äôs bulk and at the inter- face could account for the discrepancy in observed exchange bias magnitudes between the two systems. 2.2.
Magnetic Structure of the Tetragonally Distorted UO2 The principal possibility for a magnetic structure switching in tetragonally distorted UO2 stems from the frustration between various AFM orders in its bulk magnetic structure, as explained in the introduction.
The resolution of this frustration in cu- bic UO2 Figure 1a cannot be ascribed to the single-ion mag- netic anisotropy (SIA) since the ground state of the U4+ ion in a cubic environment is a completely isotropic triplet.[15] Recent Ô¨Årst-principles calculations[24,25] employing a correlated treat- ment of the 5f-electron shell have shown that a small energy diÔ¨Äerence between 1k, 2k, and 3k ordering is due to high-rank quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. In particular, Ref.
[24] em- ploys the DFT+HI method together with the FT-HI approach to derive the full super-exchange Hamiltonian of UO2.
This work showed that the experimental 3k is stabilized with respect to the competing structures by quadrupole-quadrupole super-exchange interactions (SEI).
In the case of tetragonally distorted UO2, the SEI Hamiltonian needs to be supplemented by a SIA term: H = HSEI + HSIA = HDD + HQQ + HSIA (1) where HSEI and HSIA are the SEI and SIA contributions, respec- tively.
The former is split between the dipole-dipole (DD) and quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ) terms acting within the ground- state (GS) Œì5 triplets of U4+ ion as deÔ¨Åned in Ref. [26].
The tetrag- onal crystal Ô¨Åeld (CF) splits the GS triplet inducing the SIA.
We employ ab initio HSEI and HSIA, please see the Method Section for details of our theoretical approach.
For the distortion level of the LAO-based layer (ùúñ= c/a‚Äì 1 = 2.5%), we obtained the value of 210 meV for the overall crystal Ô¨Åeld (splitting of the U4+ atomic multiplet 3H4.
This value is very close to our previously obtained value of 207 meV for the cubic case [24] and is in good agreement with experimental estimates.[15] The Œì5 triplet ground state is split by the tetragonal elongation into a doublet ground state and an excited singlet.
This splitting is linear with ùúñand reaches 2.78 meV for the LAO-based layer.
Introducing the pseudo-angular momentum J = 1 to label the Œì5 eigenstates as speciÔ¨Åed in Ref.
[24], one may write the SIA term at a given U site as HSIA = -D Jz 2.
The anisotropy constant D = Cùúñ is linear versus the distortion, with the pre-factor C = 113 meV extracted from DFT+HI calculations.
We then solved the calculated ab initio magnetic Hamiltonian (1) as a function of the tetragonal elongation ùúñand tempera- ture within the mean-Ô¨Åeld (MF) approximation.[40] The result- ing phase diagram is depicted in Figure 5 (left).
Cubic UO2 is predicted to order into the transverse 3k AFM structure shown in Figure 1a at the theoretical TN bulk = 56 K, the overestimation as compared to the experimental value of 30 K is due to the MF approximation.[24] This structure remains stable at small tetrag- onal distortions, however, the moment amplitude along the out- of-plane z direction increases with ùúñdue to the SIA eÔ¨Äect.
The or- dered moment at U site R is given MR = [M||exp(‚àíikzR),M||exp( ‚àíikxR),M‚ä•exp( ‚àíikyR)] , where M|| and M‚ä•are the amplitude of the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the moment, respectively, M|| < M‚ä•, and kx,y,z are propagation vectors in the corresponding directions.
At the transition point between the two structures the in-plane amplitude M|| becomes 0, thus the Adv. Funct. Mater.

The cyan, brown, and white areas display the regions of stability for the transverse 1k, transverse 3k, and paramagnetic phases, respectively.
The temperature is related to the theoretical mean-Ô¨Åeld bulk TN = 56 K. (Right) Schematic repre- sentation of various directions of magnetic moments of UO2 and Fe3O4 and the corresponding angles between the moments.
This representation is derived based on the epitaxial relationship in Figure 1c,d, combined with general knowledge concerning the easy magnetization direction of Fe3O4 at low temperatures.
Below the Verwey transition, the magnetic easy axis in Fe3O4 is [100].[39] structure collapses into the transverse 1k one (also depicted in Figure 1a) with the out-of-plane moment direction.
The physical origin of this transition is a competition of the single-ion anisotropy HSIA induced by the tetragonal distor- tion with the super-exchange (SE) intersite term. As shown in Ref.
[24], small SE couplings between U quadrupolar moments favor the non-collinear 3k phase with the magnetic moments on U sites pointing along the <111> directions; this explains the oc- currence of this order in cubic UO2.
However, the stabilization energy of 3k structure with respect to the transverse collinear 1k one, in which the moment is along the <001> direction, is rather weak (below 1 Kelvin/f.u).
The SIA activated by the tetragonal elongation favors the moment along the out-of-plane [001] mag- netic easy axis, since the anisotropy constant D = Cùúñ> 0 for ùúñ> 0, as detailed above.
Therefore, already at relatively small distor- tions, the SIA overcomes the SE quadrupolar term inducing the transition to the 1k structure.
We note that the actual distortion level for CaF2-based Ô¨Ålms is very close to the 1k‚Üí3k transition boundary.
Provided the sensi- tivity of this boundary to the calculational details and experimen- tal conditions, the CaF2-based layers can still be considered to be in the 3k domain, while the LAO layers are Ô¨Årmly situated within the 1k region. 2.3.
Discussion Based on our Ô¨Årst-principles calculations, one may intuitively ex- pect that diÔ¨Äerent mutual arrangements of magnetic moments of cubic and tetragonally distorted UO2 and Fe3O4 would give dif- ferent EB values since the interface exchange interaction creating the EB pinning would also essentially change.
The situation is il- lustrated in a simple cartoon in Figure 5 (right).
If the magnetic structure of UO2 remains 3k in the CaF2-based thin Ô¨Ålms, the magnetic moments of UO2 lying in one of the three equivalent <111> directions coupled with the magnetic moment of Fe3O4 lying along the <100> directions at low temperatures.[39] The an- gle between the moment‚Äôs directions is 12.24¬∞.
In this case, we observe the maximum EB eÔ¨Äect in the CaF2-based samples.
If switching to another AFM state occurs upon straining the lattice of UO2, then the coupling strength and hence the magnitude of EB essentially change.
Our calculations predict stabilization of a 1k-AFM structure (Figure 5) in the distorted crystal structure, hence the orientation of the magnetization of the AFM sublat- tices would then lie in the [001] direction.
In this case, coupling with the moment of Fe3O4 occurs at the angle 54.74¬∞, resulting in the drastic reduction of EB for the LAO-based samples.
In general, it is assumed that the bulk spin conÔ¨Ågura- tion of a material is maintained even at the interface.
How- ever, real exchange-biased systems are much more complex than simple models.
The orientation of interfacial spins can be inÔ¨Çuenced by various factors, such as structural properties like crystallinity and morphology, which often manifest them- selves very diÔ¨Äerently for various material combinations.
As a result, the interfacial spin orientations in such systems can be more intricate and diÔ¨Écult to predict.
For the LAO-based samples, in addition to reduced exchange interaction due to diÔ¨Äerently oriented moments of the bulk UO2 layer, larger mosaicity[36] of the strained UO2 layer may also contribute to the decreased HEB.
It is worth noting that tetragonal deformation appearing as the result of compression of UO2 deposited on a LAO substrate in Ref.
[36] was shown to promote a formation of a magnetically ‚Äúdead‚Äù layer close to the substrate.
The exact nature of the ‚Äúdead‚Äù layer was not determined in the RXS experiment, but the evi- dence was such that it did not have the AFM structure of bulk UO2.
It is evident from our combined XRD, XRR, and RBS (Sup- porting Information) studies that the interface between the sub- strate and the UO2 layer remains well-deÔ¨Åned for all UO2 layer thicknesses on both types of substrates.
In our UO2/Fe3O4 bilay- ers, we detect exchange bias in both systems even at the small- est UO2 thicknesses.
For both types of samples, the EB magni- tude and hence, the interfacial interaction and exchange cou- pling become less prominent at UO2 thicknesses below 70 √Ö, which is in line with general behavior for various exchange- biased systems.[41] Adv. Funct. Mater.

It is crucial to highlight that the saturation magnetization in both the single Fe3O4 layers and the bilayers is essentially the same.
While ex- change bias is typically observed in systems featuring two mag- netic phases, magnetite, being a ferrimagnet with intricate crys- tal structure and structural defects,[42,43] is known for exhibit- ing exchange bias on its own in thin Ô¨Ålms deposited on various non-magnetic substrates.[44,45] Furthermore, rotational hystere- sis, related to EB, has been reported for substituted Fe3O4 sin- gle crystals[46] below the Verwey transition temperature, where the magnetic easy axes change direction.[39] The exchange bias in magnetite Ô¨Ålms, free of foreign magnetic phases, undoubt- edly has a very complex origin and is not fully understood at present.
However, the magnitude of the EB in Fe3O4 Ô¨Ålms consistently remains signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller than the exchange bias in the UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers on both types of substrates, and it does not hinder us in drawing our conclusions.
3. Conclusion The exchange bias magnitude in the stoichiometric, homoge- neous UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers depends on the type of substrate used.
In the case of small tetragonal distortion in the LAO-based UO2 layers, the EB in bilayers is signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced as compared to the CaF2-based samples.
By Ô¨Årst-principles calculations, we show that the reason dwells in the change of AFM structure as a re- sult of distortion.
UO2 Ô¨Ålms with a cubic CaF2 structure are very close to the border of 3k‚Äì1k transition and strain imposed by the substrate pushes UO2 toward the 1k AFM structure.
Our study reveals a prospect of switching frustrated magnets for potential applications.
For instance, by pairing UO2 with a soft ferromag- net (permalloy, Py) we were able to induce perpendicular mag- netic anisotropy in the Py layer through the canted moments of a CaF2-based UO2.[47] The eÔ¨Äect might be greater with an LAO- based UO2, where the direction of UO2 and Py moments would coincide.
The inherent ability to manipulate the magnetic align- ment in frustrated magnets opens avenues for tailoring device functionalities to speciÔ¨Åc requirements.
4. Experimental Section Experiment: The UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers were synthesized by reactive (- gas) dc sputtering realized in a home-built setup, using a miniature U (nat- ural uranium, 99.9 wt.% purity) and Fe (99.99% purity) targets and an electron-emitting thoriated tungsten Ô¨Ålament stabilizing the plasma.[48] DiÔ¨Äerent epitaxial strain states in the UO2 layer were realized by employ- ing diÔ¨Äerent substrates.
The thickness of the UO2 layer varied across the sample series, with a minimal thickness of 17 √Ö on the CaF2 substrate and a maximum of 340 √Ö on SiO2.
In contrast, the thickness of the Fe3O4 layer in the bilayers was maintained at ‚âà270 ¬± 20 √Ö. Before the growth, the commercially available substrates CaF2 (001), LaAlO3 (001), and fused silica SiO2 (MTI Corp.) (the results for the latter are shown in Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information) were annealed in dynamic vacuum at temperatures used for UO2 deposition as shown below.
The UO2 layer was always deposited onto the substrates at an elevated temperature of 350 ¬∞C for CaF2 and SiO2 substrates and at 500 ¬∞C for the LAO sub- strate, using a partial oxygen pressure of 1.2 √ó 10‚àí6 mbar (Ar pressure of 6 √ó 10‚àí3 mbar).
We speciÔ¨Åcally restricted the deposition temperature for the UO2 layers to 500 ¬∞C for LAO substrates to avoid passing through the ferroelastic transition that occurs at 560 ¬∞C in this substrate.
As for the CaF2 substrates, we have chosen even lower deposition tempera- tures to avoid cracking when cooling from growth temperature to ambient conditions.
The layer of Fe3O4 was deposited on the top of UO2 at room tem- perature to avoid interdiÔ¨Äusion and at 6‚Äì7 √ó 10‚àí7 mbar oxygen pres- sure (Ar pressure of 1‚Äì3 √ó 10‚àí2 mbar).
The stoichiometry of each de- posited layer was controlled in situ by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using a MgKùõº(photon energy 1253.6 eV) source.
After that, a magnesium cap was deposited for protection on top of each sample.
For the sake of comparison of properties, we also prepared 270-√Ö thick single Fe3O4 layers on the same substrates and capped them with Mg, too.
The Ô¨Ålm‚Äôs structure was characterized by several methods.
We used Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) in the channeling mode (RBS-C) using a beam of 2-MeV He+ ions to check the single-crystalline layer structure and to determine the sharpness of the interface between the magnetic layers.
RBS-C measurements were carried out on a Tande- tron MC 4130 accelerator at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in ÀáRe≈æ near Prague.
For RBS-C analysis, the crystal target was mounted onto a two-axis goniometer with an angular resolution of 0.01¬∞.
A surface-barrier Si detector with a circular aperture of 5.4 mm in diameter was placed at a distance of 70 mm from the sample holder at the scattering angle of 170¬∞.
The energy resolution of the detector was ‚âà12 keV.
The accessible information depth provided by 2-MeV He+ ion beam is ‚âà1.5 Œºm in this geometry.
The spectra were evaluated with the software SIMNRA 6.06.[49] The x-ray reÔ¨Çectometry (XRR) and x-ray diÔ¨Äraction (XRD) measure- ments were performed with Rigaku SmartLab diÔ¨Äractometer equipped with a 9 kW rotating Cu anode and 2D single photon counting detector HyPix-3000.
The primary beam (CuKùõº, ùúÜ= 1.5418 √Ö) was parallelized by a parabolic X-ray mirror.
ReÔ¨Çectivity curves (Figure S6, Supporting Infor- mation) were measured with two receiving slits in front of the detector, Low-Resolution XRD reciprocal space maps (RSM) were measured with a collimated beam in both directions (0.5 √ó 0.5 mm2) and open 2D detec- tor without secondary optics.
XRD Œò‚àí2Œò scans and medium-resolution RSMs measurements were performed with a detector in the 1D mode us- ing a monochromatized beam by a 2-bounce Ge(220) monochromator (Cu Kùõº1, ùúÜ= 1.5406 √Ö).
From the XRR data, we determined the thickness of individual layers and the roughness of the corresponding interfaces.
The epitaxial relationship of all layers was determined from the Low-Resolution Reciprocal Space Maps (RSMs).
Lattice parameters and the relaxation state of the UO2 layers were found using RSM measurements, enabling us to obtain both out-of-plane and in-plane lattice parameters and the thick- ness of the single crystal layers.
Precise values were determined through simulation based on the kinematic theory of diÔ¨Äraction.
The magnetization studies were conducted using a vibrating sample magnetometer on the Quantum Design PPMS9 platform (Quantum De- sign).
The magnetic Ô¨Åeld was applied along the sample surface.
The sus- ceptibilities of blank (001) CaF2, (001) LaAlO3, and SiO2 substrates, each with a thickness of 0.5 mm, were measured, and their magnetic signals were subtracted from the magnetization data.
Theory: We employ the same SEI as calculated in Ref.
[24] for cubic UO2, thus neglecting the eÔ¨Äect of tetragonal distortions on their mag- nitude, which is likely unimportant provided the rather small distortion magnitude.
In order to evaluate the SIA term, we calculate the splitting of the GS triplet in UO2 versus the magnitude of tetragonal distortions by means of the self-consistent DFT+Hubbard-I (HI) approximation [28‚Äì30] using the same as in Ref. [24].
Namely, we employ U = 4.5 eV and Hund‚Äôs rule coupling JH = 0.6 eV to specify a rotationally invariant on-site Coulomb repulsion on the U 5f shell, the fully-localized limit double-counting term for the nominal atomic occupancy of 2 of the U4+ 5f shell.
3000 k-points were employed in the Brillouin zone integration and the LAPW basis cutoÔ¨Ä[29] RMT‚ãÖKMAX = 7.
We adjusted the out-of-plane lattice parameter c so as to keep the cell volume Ô¨Åxed at its bulk value. Adv. Funct. Mater.
