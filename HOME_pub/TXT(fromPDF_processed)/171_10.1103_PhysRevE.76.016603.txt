We present generalized Fresnel formulas, describing the inﬂuence of the nonlocal dispersion on the reﬂectance and transmittance of single- and double-layer gradient photonic barriers for S and P waves and arbitrary angles of incidence.
The nonlocal dispersion of such layers, arising due to a concave spatial proﬁle of dielectric susceptibility across the plane ﬁlm, is shown to result in a peculiar heterogeneity-induced optical anisotropy, providing the propagation of S P waves in tunneling traveling regimes.
The results obtained indicate the possibility of narrow-band nonattenuated tunneling complete transmittance of oblique S waves through such heterogeneous barriers, and the existence of spectral areas characterized by the strong reﬂection of P waves and profound contrast between transmitted S and P waves.
The scalability of obtained exact analytical solutions of Maxwell equations into the different spectral ranges is discussed and the application potential of these phenomena for miniaturized polarizers and ﬁlters is demonstrated.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.76.016603 PACS numbers: 42.25.Bs I. INTRODUCTION Tunneling is a basic wave phenomenon with many inter- esting applications.
The concept of tunneling was pioneered by Gamow for particles in quantum mechanics as long ago as in 1928 1. Later on both the quantum approach, involv- ing the time-independent Schrodinger equation, and the wave approach, involving the Helmholtz monochromatic wave equation, were considered to be formally equivalent.
The advent of lasers has attracted attention to the effects associated with tunneling of the electromagnetic EM waves through classical barriers in a series of optoelectronic prob- lems such as, e.g., the evanescent modes in dielectric waveguides 2 and liquid crystals 3, and the Goos- Hanchen effect for curvilinear interfaces 4–6. Experiments in the microwave range with an “undersized” waveguide 7, and the Goos-Hanchen spatial shift of a narrow beam, pass- ing through parafﬁne double prisms 8, have demonstrated the possibilities of observation of tunneling effects, which proved not to be easy to reproduce at quantum scales.
Side by side with the numerous applications of the tunneling con- cept in optoelectronics, solid state, and microwave physics 9, this concept contains an intriguing theoretical challenge, connected with the idea of superluminal light tunneling through the photonic barrier known as the Hartman paradox 10,11.
The theoretical background of the aforesaid investigation is based on the electromagnetics of heterogeneous media 12. Herein some important features of evanescent waves are examined usually in the framework of a simple model of a rectangular opaque barrier 13 or layered structure, formed by steplike variations of refractive indices 14. Another ﬁeld for wave-tunneling phenomena is connected with the gradi- ent optics of thin ﬁlms: the nonlocal dispersion, arising due to continuous spatial variations of dielectric susceptibility was shown recently to provide a rich variety of tunneling phenomena even in a material with negligible natural local dispersion 15. These phenomena can be examined by means of exact analytical solutions of Maxwell equations for media with spatially distributed dielectric susceptibility z = n0 2U2z. 1 Here n0 is the value of the host dielectric refractive index; the dimensionless function Uz describes the coordinate de- pendence of the dielectric susceptibility.
This heterogeneity can result in the formation of a cutoff frequency , depen- dent on the gradient and curvature of the z proﬁle 15.
Thus, for heterogeneous nanoﬁlms with a thickness of about 100 nm and with a depth of modulation of refractive index about 25% the cutoff frequencies , separating the evanes- cent and traveling modes, belong to the near IR or visible spectral ranges.
Controlled variety of reﬂection-refraction properties of the layer, produced by different proﬁles Uz, opens new possibilities of designing of media with optical properties unattainable in natural materials.
The role of the heterogeneity-induced dispersion was ex- amined in Ref.
15 for the case of normal incidence, when the wave-polarization effects are vanishing; however, the model Uz used in Ref. 15 does not provide analytical solutions of the wave equation in the inclined incidence case.
Unlike Ref. 15, this paper is devoted to the peculiar effects in the reﬂectivity and transmittivity of both S- and P-polarized waves, incidenting under an arbitrary angle on an heterogeneous dielectric layer, characterized by some pro- ﬁle Uz.
The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II we present a model of nonmonotonic concave proﬁle Uz, suitable for both S and P waves in the gradient medium and demonstrate the effects of heterogeneity-induced optical anisotropy.
Exact PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 1539-3755/2007/761/01660311 ©2007 The American Physical Society 016603-1analytical solutions of the wave equations obtained for such Uz, revealing the polarization-dependent propagation and tunneling regimes for both one- and two-gradient layers, are examined in Sec. III. In Sec.
IV we use these solutions for the analysis of narrow-band reﬂectionless tunneling of S waves, the strong reﬂection of P waves, the deep contrast between transmitted S and P waves, and some phase effects, associated with the aforesaid phenomena.
The conclusions are summarized in Sec. V. II.
PROPAGATION AND TUNNELING OF S- AND P-POLARIZED WAVES IN GRADIENT MEDIA (EXACTLY SOLVABLE MODEL) Unlike in the case of the normal incidence, here the waves have a different polarization structure and are described by different equations.
By denoting the normal to the layer as the z axis and choosing the projection of the wave vector on the layer’s interface as the y axis, one can describe the po- larization structure of an S wave by means of its electric component Ex and the magnetic components Hy and Hz.
The layer is assumed to be lossless and nonmagnetic, and one can write the Maxwell equations linking these components as Ex z = −1 c Hy t , Ex y = 1 c Hz t , Hz y −Hy z = z c Ex t , 2 divE¯ = 0, divH¯  = 0.
3 Components of the P wave Hx, Ey, and Ez also satisfy Eqs. 3, however Eqs.
2 are in this case replaced by Hx z = z c Ey t , Hx y = −z c Ez t , Ez y −Ey z = −1 c Hx t .
4 The effects of heterogeneity-induced dispersion for inclined incidence can be found from the set of Eqs. 2–4 by means of exactly solvable models of z given by Eq. 1, suitable for both S and P polarizations.
The well-known Rayleigh proﬁle Uz=1+z/L−1, dating back to 1880, and the expo- nential proﬁle Uz=exp±z/L provide exact solutions of the set of equations 2–4 for monotonic variations of Uz 12; however, these models are not suitable for the descrip- tion of smoothly varying concave photonic barriers, which we plan to discuss.
Thus, the reﬂection-refraction problem for the set of equations 2–4 is considered below from the very beginning.
It is convenient to express the ﬁeld compo- nents in Maxwell equations by means of the following aux- iliary, polarization-dependent functions s and p: S polarization: Ex = −1 c ds dt , Hy = ds dz , Hz = −ds dy , 5 P polarization: Hx = −1 c dp dt , Ey = 1 z dp dz , Ez = − 1 z dp dy .
6 Using such representations one can reduce the system Eqs.
2–4 to two equations, governing S and P waves, respec- tively.
Omitting for simplicity the factor expikyy−t, these equations can be written as 2s z2 + 2n0 2U2 c2 −ky 2s = 0, ky =  c sin , 7 2p z2 + 2n0 2U2 c2 −ky 2p = 2 U dU dz p z .
8 By introducing the new variable  and the new functions fs and fp,  = z0 z Uz1dz1, fs = sUz, fp = p Uz , 9 where z0 denotes the position of the ﬁlm or vacuum ﬁrst interface, one can present Eqs.
7 and 8 for S and P waves in the forms d2fs d2 + fs −U 2U + U 2 4U2 = 0, 10 d2fp d2 + fp + U 2U −3U 2 4U2 = 0, 11 where =2n0 2/c2−ky 2/U2, U=dU/d, and U =d2U/d2.
Equations 10 and 11 are valid for arbitrary proﬁles of photonic barriers Uz and all angles of incidence , including, in particular, the two well-known exactly solv- able models mentioned above: the Rayleigh and exponential proﬁles.
The fact that some polarization effects will depend on the barrier proﬁle is clear even without a solution of these equations.
In the case of the widely used Rayleigh proﬁle UR, which can be rewritten in  space by means of Eq. 9 as UR=exp−/L, both Eqs. 10 and 11 coincide: d2fs,p d2 + fs,p n0 c  2	1 −cr 2 2 −sin2  n0 2 exp 2 L   = 0. 12 Equation 12 shows that, due to heterogeneity-induced dis- persion, characterized by a cutoff frequency cr=c/2n0L, the tunneling regimes arise in the Rayleigh barrier for both S and P waves simultaneously.
In the case of the exponential pro- ﬁle, rewritten in  space as U=1±/L, no heterogeneity- induced cutoff frequency can be deﬁned from Eqs. 10 and 11. In contrast to these traditionally used asymmetrical pro- ﬁles, we consider here the exactly solvable symmetrical con- cave barrier Uz, formed inside the dielectric ﬁlm with the thickness d by variation of U from the value U=1 in the center of the barrier z=0 up to the values Um at the inter- faces z= ±d/2 Fig. 1 represents the case of a system con- sisting of two such barriers deposited on a substrate with the constant refractive index nD, SHVARTSBURG, KUZMIAK, AND PETITE PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-2U = 1 cos z L , Um = 1 m, m = cos d 2L. 13 With these conventions, the integral in Eq. 9 should be taken from z0=−d/2.
Note that this model is characterized by one free parameter—the length scale L, however, it can be used to study many features associated with this type of po- tential as we will show in Sec. IV.
In fact, it represents a particular case of a more general potential with two adjust- able parameters which, however, leads to much more cum- bersome calculations and thus is not developed here.
By sub- stituting Eq. 13 into Eq. 9 one can express the proﬁle U in terms of the new variable ,  = L ln	 1 + tgz/2L 1 −tgz/2L , U = 1 cos z L = ch,  =  L .
14 By using Eq. 14 one can rewrite Eqs. 10 and 11 for S and P waves inside the barrier given by Eq. 13 into the similar form, d2fs,p d2 + fs,pq2 −	s,p ch2 = 0, 15 q2 = n0L c  21 −2 2, 16 	s = kyL2 + 1 4, 	p = kyL2 −3 4 , 17 where  is a characteristic frequency, determined by the pa- rameters of concave barrier 13,  = c 2n0L = c n0d arccosm.
18 The sign of parameter q2 given by Eq. 16 changes in =. Let us consider here the low-frequency spectral range  , q2 0.
In this range the expression in brackets in Eq. 15 for the S wave is always negative, and thus the low- frequency S wave, incidenting on the barrier given by Eq. 13 under an arbitrary angle , is traversing this barrier as an evanescent wave.
On the contrary, the same expression in Eq. 15 for a P wave, for realistic values of the modulation of the refractive index 13 in the layer Um=m−1 1.3–1.4 remains positive and provides the traveling-mode regime for the P wave.
Thus, unlike the homogeneous rectangular barrier, where the tunneling of the EM waves is determined by a condition common to both S and P polarizations, the tunneling through the concave barrier given by Eq. 13 proves to be polariza- tion dependent.
This heterogeneity-induced anisotropy can result in a signiﬁcant difference in reﬂectivity and transmit- tivity of such a barrier for S and P waves, with their frequen- cies and angles of incidence on the layer being equal.
This difference is illustrated below by means of the exactly solv- able model 13. III.
HETEROGENEITY-INDUCED OPTICAL ANISOTROPY OF TRANSPARENT LAYERS To simplify the analysis of the transmission of a concave photonic barrier for the EM wave with inclined incidence, let us ﬁrst consider one layer without a substrate embedded in free space see Fig. 1. We introduce the dimensionless quan- tities u = /  1, N = 1 −u−2   1. 19 By transforming Eq. 15 by means of the new variable   and the new function W,   = 1 −th 2 , fs,p = chN/2Ws,p, 20 one obtains for this function the hypergeometric equation  1 − d2W d 2 +  − 1 +  + dW d −W = 0,  = 1 −N 2 . 21 Although Eq. 21 is valid for both polarizations, the values of parameters  and  have to be speciﬁed for each wave, while the deﬁnition  given by Eq. 21 is valid for both waves.
Let us start the analysis from the S wave; in this case s,s = 1 2	1 −N ± i sin 1 −N2 n0  .
22 Since s+s+1=2, two linearly independent solutions of Eq. 21 are given by the hypergeometric functions Fs,s,,  and Fs,s,,1− , denoted below for com- FIG. 1.
Pair of gradient layers, supported by an homogeneous substrate; the thickness of each layer and substrate are d and D, respectively; the proﬁle of the refractive index inside each gradient layer is described by Eq. 13.

The general solution of Eq. 21 reads as W = F  + QsF1 − . 23 Here F  and F1−  can be considered as forward and backward waves meaning more exactly in a tunneling case, evanescent and antievanescent waves, while the factor Qs is associated with the contribution of backward wave to the total ﬁeld.
By using the variables deﬁned in Eqs. 9 and 19 and expressing the factor ch  in terms of cosz/L according to Eq. 14, one can present the generating function s in the form s = cosz/L1−N/2W. 24 The substitution of Eq. 24 into Eq. 5 yields the explicit expressions for components of the S wave inside the me- dium, Ex = iA c s, Hz = −ikyAs, Hy = −A 2Lcosz/LN+1/21 −Nsinz/LW + cos2z/LdW d , 25 where A is the complex amplitude of the wave.
To ﬁnd the reﬂection coefﬁcient for the S wave Rs one has to use the continuity conditions on the ﬁlm interfaces z= ±d/2.
It fol- lows from Eq. 14 that th = sinz/L,   = 1 −sinz/L 2 , 1 −  = 1 + sinz/L 2 .
26 Let us consider the wave incidenting on the interface z=−d/2.
By introducing the variables  1,2,    z=−d/2 =  1 = 1 + s 2 ,  1 −  z=+d/2 =  2 = 1 −s 2 , s = 1 −m2, F1,2 = F 1,2, F1 =dF d   1 , F2 =dF d   2 .
27 Using the values of ﬁeld components 25 on the interface z=−d/2 and omitting, for simplicity, here and below the phase factors expikyy−t, one can derive the expression for Rs from the continuity conditions on this interface, Rs = M1 + isF1 + QsM2 + isF2 isF1 −M1 + QsisF2 −M2 , 28 M1,2 = sN −1F1,2 ± m2F1,2  , s = m cos 1 −N2 n0 .
29 The factor Qs can be determined in the same way from the continuity conditions on the opposite interface z=d/2, Qs = − M2 −isF2 M1 −isF1. 30 By substituting Qs given by Eq. 30 into Eq. 28 one ob- tains the complex reﬂection coefﬁcient Rs, Rs = As Bs , As = M1 2 −M2 2 + s 2F1 2 −F2 2, Bs = B1 + iB2, B1 = M2 2 −M1 2 + s 2F1 2 −F2 2, B2 = 2sF1M1 −F2M2. 31 Now we rewrite the complex reﬂection coefﬁcient Rs into the form Rs= Rs expisr,  Rs  =  As B1 2 + B2 2, sr = −arctan B2 B1. 32 To ﬁnd the transmission function Ts we express the ampli- tude of the refracted wave A from Eq. 25 in terms of the amplitude of the incidenting wave E0 and the reﬂection co- efﬁcient Rs, A = −iE0c1 + Rs F1 + QsF2 .
33 By using Eq. 33 one can write the ﬁeld E at the interface z=d/2 by means of a complex transmission function Ts, E = E0Ts, Ts =  Ts expist,  Ts  = 2s F1M2 −F2M1 B1 2 + B2 2 , st = arctan B1 B2. 34 The reﬂection coefﬁcient for the P wave Rp can be calcu- lated in the same way.
The generating function p Eq. 6 is expressed via the relevant solution of Eq. 21, similar to Eq. 23, p = cosz/L−N+1/2Fp,p,,  + QpFp,p,,1 − , Qp = − M4 −ipF4 M3 −ipF3, p = n0 cos 1 −N2 m .
35 Forward and backward propagating waves are described by Eq. 35 in terms of the hypergeometric functions F with parameters SHVARTSBURG, KUZMIAK, AND PETITE PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-4p,p = 1 2	1 −N ±4 −1 −N2sin2  n0 2  ,  = 1 −N 2 .
36 By substituting the generating function given by Eq. 35 into Eq. 6 one obtains the components of the P wave.
Us- ing the continuity conditions, one can present the reﬂection coefﬁcient Rp in a form, analogous to Rs Eq. 32.
Rp = M3 + ipF3 + QpM4 + ipF4 ipF3 −M3 + QpipF4 −M4 , Rp =  Rp expipr,  Rp  =  Ap B3 2 + B4 2, pr = −arctan B4 B3, Ap = M3 2 −M4 2 + p 2F3 2 −F4 2, B3 = M4 2 −M3 2 + p 2F3 2 −F4 2, B4 = 2pF3M3 −F4M4, M3,4 = sN + 1F3,4 ± m2F3,4  , F3,4  = dFp,p,,  d  = 1,2 .
37 The transmission function for the P wave Tp can be found by analogy with Eqs. 33 and 34 in the form Tp =  Tp expipt,  Tp  = 2p F3M4 −F4M3 B3 2 + B4 2 , pt = arctan B3 B4. 38 Thus, we found the expressions for reﬂection coefﬁcients Rs,p and transmission functions Ts,p, valid for an arbitrary angle of incidence . The quantities  Rs,p  and  Ts,p  are linked by the energy conservation law,  Ts,p 2 = 1 − Rs,p 2. 39 It is worth emphasizing that in the normal incidence case =0 the difference between S- and P-polarized waves van- ishes, and thus the modules of reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients have to be equal.
This equality, which is not obvious from the formulas for  Rs  Eq. 32 and  Rp  Eq. 37, is demonstrated in the Appendix.
Therein we show that the ﬁeld expressions for S and P waves inside the ﬁlm coin- cide in this case, as it should, and hence all the derived quantities.
The effects of heterogeneity-induced dispersion on the amplitude-phase structure of transmitted radiation manifest themselves, ﬁrst of all, by the angular dependence of the transmittance of gradient layers for S- and P-polarized waves.
These transmittances,  Ts 2 and  Tp 2, calculated by using Eqs. 34 and 38, respectively, are depicted in Fig. 2.
In the case of inclined incidence  Tp 2, exceeding  Ts 2 can even reach the value  Tp 2=1, illustrating the Brewster effect for a gradient layer.
The angle , however, which is related to this reﬂectionless regime, differs from the Brewster angle B for an homogeneous layer tgB=n0. In Fig. 2 we present the angular dependence of transmit- tances of an heterogeneous layer for S and P waves for some given value of dimensionless parameter  given by Eq. 21, deﬁned for any normalized frequency u=/.
Considering the transmittance regime, related to some values , m, , and n0 and using the characteristic frequency  given by Eq. 18, one can choose the thickness of the layer d, providing the formation of such a regime for arbitrary polarization and wavelength  by using the following expression derived from Eqs. 21 and 18: d  = 1 −41 −2 arccosm 2n0 .
40 Thus, for the set of parameters related to Fig. 2 and  =1.55 m, Eq. 40 deﬁnes the thickness of the layer d =45 nm; herein Fig. 2 remains valid for any values of d and , linked by relation 40 with m=0.75, n0=3.4, and  =0.75.
To compare these results with the transmittance of an ho- mogeneous layer m=1 with the same values of d and n0, one can use the formulas for reﬂection coefﬁcients Rs and Rp 20, presented in forms similar to that of Eqs. 31 and 37, respectively, Rs = AsB1 + iB2−1, As = n0 2 −1tg, B1 = r2 + cos2 tg, B2 = 2r cos , r2 = n0 2 −sin2 ,  = dr c = 2n0d  1 −sin2  n0 2 , Rp = ApB3 + iB4−1, Ap = −n0 4 cos2  −r2tg, FIG.

The transmittances  Ts 2 and  Tp 2, are then found by means of Eq. 39, and are also presented in Figs. 2, 3a, and 3b. To calculate the dependence of the transmittances on the frequency-dependent parameter u, one needs to evaluate the factor tg by using the ratio d/, as a function of u and that is given by Eq. 40. The spectral properties of transmittance for S and P waves are presented in Figs. 3–6 in the  T 2−u or in the  T 2−u planes.
These graphs illustrate the quantitative differences in transmittances, produced by proﬁles Uz.
Namely, Fig. 3b shows a narrow spectral window for the total transmittance of S waves, which profoundly differs from the smoothly varying function Ts 2 for the homogeneous ﬁlm.
Herein the comparison of Figs. 3a and 3b, drawn for one gradient layer, shows that the increase of depth of modulation of re- fractive index m can result in signiﬁcant changes of the transmittance-reﬂection spectra of the gradient layer for S waves.
A narrow asymmetrical peak of reﬂectionless tunnel- ing for S waves arises near the point u=1, =1.
This peak is contiguous with a narrow area of high dispersion of trans- mittance coefﬁcient with almost vertical tangent to the graph  Ts 2.
The transmittance  Tp 2 in this range remains almost constant, approximately 87%.
When the angle of incidence is decreased the existence of the peak is unaffected while trans- mittance  Tp 2 tends to 100% see Fig. 3c. On the other hand, in the lower-frequency spectral range close to the point =0.5—see Fig. 3c—the reﬂection of S waves is almost unvariable, close to 100%, while the trans- mittance of P waves tends to zero; herein the frequency dis- persion of  Tp 2 in this range is strong.
The large contrast between the transmittance of gradient layers for S and P waves may prove to be of interest for polarizing systems, operating under the large angles of incidence.
The thickness of the layers may be rather small: e.g., a polarizing screen, providing for transmitted waves the ratio  Tp 2/ Ts 2 0.05, is characterized, under the conditions shown in Fig. 3c u =3.2, by the ratio d/=0.025 determined from Eq. 40. Such a miniaturized scale d represents a remarkable feature of the anisotropic gradient nanolayers considered. IV.
NARROW-BAND REFLECTIONLESS TUNNELING OF S WAVES While discussing the transmittance peaks for S waves  Ts 2=1 in the spectral range  u1 Figs. 3b and 3c, one has to emphasize that these peaks arise in the regime of the reﬂectionless tunneling of wave Rs=0 through the gra- dient layer.
The cancellation of the reﬂected-wave results from the interference of the wave reﬂected on the interface z=−d/2, with the transmitted part of the backward antieva- nescent wave.
This cancellation arises only for the concave photonic barrier: in the case of a square barrier with a con- stant refractive index, such cancellation proves to be impos- sible 17. FIG.

SHVARTSBURG, KUZMIAK, AND PETITE PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-6Proceeding in a similar fashion, we can ﬁnd the transmit- tance of a pair of gradient layers for S- and P-polarized waves, characterized by coefﬁcients  T2s 2 and  T2p 2.
To cal- culate these coefﬁcients let us examine the set of two parallel adjacent layers, shown in Fig. 1.
Herein the continuity con- ditions on the interfaces z=−d/2 and z=3d/2 remain un- changed.
Considering ﬁrst the S wave, one can see that for- mulas for Rs Eq. 28 and Qs Eq. 30 relating to these conditions for the S wave, are also valid for the set of two layers.
Recalling these conditions for the intermediate boundary z=d/2, one can ﬁnd, after some tedious algebra, the value Q, related to this boundary, Q = −	 F1M2 + M1F2 + 2QsM2F2 QsF1M2 + M2F1 + 2M1F1 .
42 Here the values M1,2 and Qs are deﬁned in Eqs. 29 and 30. The substitution of Eq. 42 into Eq. 28 yields the complex reﬂection coefﬁcient R2s for the set of two layers, R2s = Gs Ks + iJs , Gs = F1M1 −F2M2M1 2 −M2 2 + s 2F1 2 −F2 2, Ks = F1M1 −F2M2M2 2 −M1 2 + s 2F1 2 −F2 2, Js = sF1 2 −F2 2M1 2 −M2 2 + F1M1 −F2M22. 43 The reﬂection coefﬁcient of the same pair for the P wave R2p can be determined by analogy with Eq. 43 by means of the replacement of indices s→p in the relevant terms in Eqs. 42 and 43, e.g., Gs→Gp, and the following transposi- tions: R2p = Gp Kp + iJp , F1,2 →F3,4, M1,2 →M3,4, s →p.
44 In the case of normal incidence one again obtains  R2s 2 = R2p 2 see the Appendix.
The transmission coefﬁcients  T2s 2 and  T2p 2 for the pair of layers, found by means of the substitution of Eqs. 43 and 44 into Eq. 39, are presented in Fig. 4.
The comparison of Figs. 4a and 4b shows the strengthening of optical aniso- tropy of gradient ﬁlms due to the increase of their heteroge- neity.
The decrease of m from m=0.95 Fig. 4a to m =0.86 Fig. 4b results again in the formation of reﬂection- less tunneling nonattenuated transmittance regimes for S waves as well as the huge dispersion of  T2s 2 and the slowly varying high transmittance of P waves near the point u=1.
However, in this geometry the range of reﬂectionless tunnel- ing contains two closely located peaks with a very narrow spectral width see Fig. 5.
Thus, such a pair of ﬁlms can be considered as a model of miniaturized frequency ﬁlter for S waves.
We note that the effects of nonattenuated tunneling FIG.

In Fig. 6 we present the phase shifts of transmitted waves .
The phase times tph=/ are positive for the S wave in all the spectral range u 1, while for the P wave the values tph are positive in a broad spectral interval 0.55   1 and negative in a narrow spectral interval 0.52   0.55.
In the former interval the phase shift of P waves, passing through the pair of layers, can reach values close to ±/2.
A comparison of phases of reﬂected Eq. 32 and trans- mitted Eq. 34 S waves leads to the relation tgsrtgst +1=0.
A similar relation between the phases can be found from Eqs. 37 and 38 for P waves as well, and they are linked as sr −st = pr −pt = ±  2 .
45 Formulas 43 and 44 show that the correlation 45, de- rived for one layer, remains valid for a pair of layers.
This property can be used for the determination of the phase of tunneling wave, if its detection is impeded due to strong attenuation in an opaque barrier 19. Until now our analysis was restricted to the model of heterogeneous ﬁlms without a substrate.
To examine the ap- plicability of our results to the real case of a layer supported by a substrate, let us consider a layer deposited on an homo- geneous lossless layer of thickness D and with refractive index nD see Fig. 1.
By presenting the generating function for, e.g., the S wave, inside the homogeneous layer in the form D = expikz + QD exp−ikzexp⌊ikyy −t⌋, k =  c r, r = nD 2 −sin2 , 46 and by using the continuity conditions on the interface be- tween this layer and air z=d+D, one can ﬁnd the parameter QD that enters Eq. 46 in the form QD = − cos  −r cos  + rexp2ikD. 47 The continuity conditions on the interface between the layer and the heterogeneous ﬁlm can be written by means of Eqs.
25–27. M2 + QsM1 F2 + QsF1 = 2iLrm c  1 −QD 1 + QD. 48 The expression in parentheses in Eq. 48 can be rewritten by means of Eq. 47 in the form 1 −QD 1 + QD = cos  −irtg r −i cos  ,  = rD c .
49 If the thickness D is chosen so that DnD 2 −sin2  c = l, l = 1,2,3, ... , 50 where the right side of Eq. 48 is reduced to is Eq. 29, and the value Qs, deﬁned from Eq. 48, as well as the re- ﬂection coefﬁcient Rs, coincide with the values 30 and 32, calculated in the absense of a substrate.
The same con- dition 50 can also be found for the P wave.
Thus, when the condition 50 is fulﬁlled, this layer does not affect the reﬂection-refraction properties of the gradient ﬁlms dis- cussed.
When the gradient layer is deposited on a homogeneous transparent substrate with refractive index n and thickness D, the expressions for reﬂection coefﬁcients Rs and Rp obtained above can be generalized by means of the relevant continuity conditions on the interface z=d/2.
In particular, in the case when Dct, where t is the duration of the incident wave pulse thick substrate—so that no interference effects can occur between the incident and the far-interface reﬂected pulse—or when the reﬂection is eliminated by the use of an antireﬂection coating or by using a wedged substrate, these generalized expressions for a single layer read as Rs = As1 Bs1 , As1 = M1 2 −M2 2 + s1F1 2 −F2 2 + is −1F1M1 −F2M2, Bs1 = M2 2 −M1 2 + s1F1 2 −F2 2 + is + 1F1M1 −F2M2, 1 = s r cos  , FIG.
6. Color online Phases of S full line and P waves dot- ted line, propagating through the pair of layers under the condi- tions, given in the caption to Fig. 4a. SHVARTSBURG, KUZMIAK, AND PETITE PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-8r = n2 −sin2 . 51 The value Rp can be obtained from this Rs by applying the transpositions As1 →Ap1, Bs1 →Bp1, F1,2 →F3,4, M1,2 →M3,4, s →p, 1 →p r cos  .
In the case when n=1 air and r=sin , these formulas re- duce to Eqs.31 and 37, respectively.
The condition of reﬂectionless tunneling R1s=0 results in two equations, nul- lifying the real and imaginary parts of the numerator As1.
Combining Equations ReAs1=0, and ImAs1=0, one ob- tains the expression r, r cos  = M2 2 −M1 2 s 2F1 2 −F2 2 .
52 The right side of Eq. 52 is known, therefore r =n2−sin2  and, ﬁnally, one obtains the value of the refrac- tive index of substrate n, which provides such nonattenuated tunneling.
Then the values Ts and Tp can be calculated by using Eq. 39. An example of transmittance through a gra- dient photonic barrier deposited on a thick substrate with refractive index n for the S and P waves, calculated accord- ing to Eq. 52, is depicted in Fig. 7 and denoted by Tsn and Tpn, respectively.
We ﬁnd that the presence of the thick sub- strate affects the transmittance for the S wave denoted by Ts in Fig. 7 and results in a broadening of the peak of the transmittance and an increase of its minimum in comparison with the transmittance without the substrate.
However, the main tendencies in the spectrum remain unchanged, while the change of the transmittance for the P wave is negligible.
V. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have considered the transmittance of gradient photonic barriers, formed by thin dielectric layers with concave proﬁles of refractive index, for both S- and P-polarized EM waves, incidenting on these barriers under arbitrary angles.
The nonlocal dispersion, determined by the shape of photonic barriers, is shown to provide a peculiar optical anisotropy, stipulating the propagation of the P S -polarized waves in the traveling tunneling regime.
The amplitude-phase structure of reﬂected and transmitted S- and P-polarized waves is found in the framework of the exactly solvable model of gradient barriers, and the generalized Fresnel formulas for the reﬂectance and transmittance of single-layer and double-layer concave photonic barriers are presented.
The effect of narrow-band reﬂectionless tunneling 100% transmittance of the S wave is demonstrated.
These solutions, obtained without any assumptions regarding the smallness or slowness of variations of EM ﬁelds or media, can be used as a benchmark of some approximations, found by the transfer-matrix approach 20 or numerical solutions for EM ﬁelds in spatially varying media 21. The examples of the use of these results in the gradient optics of nanolayers may become useful for the design of miniaturized subwave- length optoelectronic devices, operating with the oblique in- cidence of EM waves, such as polarizers, phase shifters, frequency-selective interfaces, and large incidence angles ﬁl- ters.
In the optical and near IR domain, there are already known technological solutions to the fabrication of such de- vices.
Gradient index ﬁlms with refractive index variations in excess of 30%—typically 1.45–1.9—over a few tens of na- nometers can be realized using, e.g., silicon oxinitride with varying O/N stoichiometry 22. The plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technology used in the fabrication of such structures allow large-scale treatment.
The Ion- implantation method represents another solution for control- ling locally the refractive index of a material.
If the methods used for obtaining such gradient layers can be generalized to materials operating in different wavelength ranges, the scalability of our exact analytical solutions to the different spectral ranges opens new perspectives for the de- sign of materials with electromagnetic properties unattain- able in the natural media.

APPENDIX To conﬁrm the equality of ﬁelds inside the barrier and of the reﬂection coefﬁcients for S and P waves in the case of normal incidence ky=0, d/dy=0, let us start from general Eq. 2 for the S wave and Eq. 4 for the P wave; with an incidence angle tending to zero, these equations coincide if FIG.

POLARIZATION-DEPENDENT TUNNELING OF LIGHT IN … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-9Exs = Eyp, Hys = −Hxp.
A1 To verify that the solutions obtained above from different equations for S and P waves, satisfy these conditions, one needs to 1 establish the link between the generating func- tions s and p in the case of normal incidence; 2 ﬁnd the expressions for the ﬁeld components for S and P waves, this link being taken into account; and 3 compare these expres- sions, revealing their coincidence.
These steps are performed below.
1 In the case of normal incidence, Eq. 8 for the P wave can be viewed as resulting from the differentiation of Eq. 7 for the S wave with respect to z; i.e., p = ds dz A2 and, thus, generating functions s and p for this case are not independent.
2 A generating function for S waves s inside the ﬁlm can be presented as a sum of forward and backward waves Eq. 23, s = As1z + Qss2−z. A3 Here A is a constant and Qs determines the contribution of the backward wave to the total ﬁeld.
The substitution of Eq. A3 into Eq. 5 brings the electric and magnetic compo- nents of the S wave.
Introducing the quantities ds1z dz = s1, ds2−z dz = −s1, A4 where the notation  indicates the derivative of function  with respect to its argument, and using the relation A2, one can write by means of Eq. 5, Exs = i c s, Hys = A⌊p1 −Qsp2⌋.
A5 We point out that the Hys component is expressed here via the generating function of the P wave.
On the other hand, considering the generating function for the P wave in a form, similar to Eq. A3, p = B⌊p1z + Qpp2−z⌋, A6 one obtains by substituting Eq. A6 into Eq. 6, Hxp = −iB c p1z + Qpp2−z. A7 Now let us write the expression for Ep Eq. 6 in the form Eyp = B n0 2U2p1 −Qpp2, A8 where B is some constant.
Using Eq. A2, one can express the ﬁrst derivative of p1 via the second derivative of s1: p1=s1, as well as p2=s2; presenting these second derivatives by means of Eq. 7, governing the gen- erating function s for normal incidence, one obtains from Eq. A8, Eyp = −2 c2 Bs1 −Qps2. A9 Thus, the component Ep of the P wave proves to be ex- pressed via the generating function for the S wave.
Now one has to compare the values Hs and Hp as well as Es and Ep, revealing the link between Qs and Qp in the case ky=0.
One can use the general properties of hypergeometric functions 16, F,,,v = 1 +   v + ¯ , dF dv =   F + 1, + 1, + 1,v, v1 −vdF,,,v dv =  −F −1,,,v − − −vF,,,v. A10 The values of parameters  and  for S and P waves for the normal incidence are found from Eqs. 22 and 36, respec- tively, s = s = 1 −N 2 , p = 3 −N 2 , p = − 1 + N 2 . A11 The product v1−v in Eq. A1, calculated for the planes z= ±d/2, is equal to m2/4.
Parameters M1,2 Eq. 29 and M3,4 Eq. 37 can be rewritten by means of Eqs. A10–A12 as M1 = 1 −NF3, M2 = −1 −NF4, and M3 = −1 + NF1, M4 = 1 + NF2.
A12 Now one can use Eq. 12 for transformation of the aforesaid factors Qs Eq. 30 and Qp Eq. 35. Dividing both the numerator and denominator of Eq. 30 by the quantity is, and using the link between s Eq. 29 and p Eq. 35, arising in a case =0, 1 −N s = p 1 + N , A13 and using the relations A12, one obtains the link between Qs and Qp in the case discussed, Qp = −Qs.
A14 The substitution of Eq. A14 into the expression for Hp Eq. A7 yields the link between free parameters A and B, A = iB c , A15 providing the fulﬁllment of condition Hxp=−Hys Eq. A1.
The substitution of Eqs. A14 and A15 into the expression SHVARTSBURG, KUZMIAK, AND PETITE PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 016603 2007 016603-10for Eyp Eq. A9 and then comparing with Es Eq. A5 shows that condition Exs=Eyp Eq. A1 is fulﬁlled too.
Thus, the ﬁeld components determined by means of gen- erating functions s and p, governed by Eqs. 7, 8, and 15–17, and those ones, governed directly by Maxwell equations 2 and 4, coincide for the normal incidence.
Moreover, the substitution of Eq. A12 into the formula for Rs Eq. 31 and a comparison with Rp Eq. 37 yields ﬁnally the physically clear result for normal incidence on the gradient layer, Rp = −Rs, Ts 2 =  Tp 2.
A16 The same substitution into the expression 43 for R2s yields the similar results for normal incidence on a pair of layers, R2p = −R2s,  T2s 2 =  T2p 2.
A17 Thus, in case of normal incidence, the difference between the solutions for S and P waves is vanishing; the regime of propagation in the gradient layer in this case is the same for both waves.
