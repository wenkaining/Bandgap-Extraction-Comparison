Various ground state ordering patterns are identiﬁed, and they are in excellent agreement with available experimental results.
Our results suggest that the primary driving force for the Na ordering is the screened Coulomb interaction among Na ions.
Possible effects of the Na ordering on the electronic structure of the CoO2 layer are discussed.
We propose that the nonexistence of a charge ordered insulating state at x=2/3 is due to the lack of a commensurate Na ordering pattern, whereas an extremely stable Na ordering at x=0.5 enhances the charge ordering tendency, resulting in an insulating state as observed experimentally.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.71.153102 PACS numberssd: 61.50.Ah, 61.18.2j, 61.66.2f The recently renewed research interest in NaxCoO2 since the discovery of superconductivity1 in the hydrated materials has revealed a range of interesting and intriguing properties of this system.
One of the most interesting discoveries is the determination of its phase diagram as the doping level x is varied:2 Two metallic phases at low and high dopings are separated by an insulating state at x=0.5.
Along with this insulating state there is strong evidence of an ordered Na layer and commensurate charge orderings in the CoO2 layer.
This raises the possibility of a subtle interplay between the Na ordering and the charge ordering in the CoO2 layer.2,3 At certain Na compositions, this interplay might have profound effects on the electronic or magnetic properties of the CoO2 layer if a particularly stable Na ordering pattern exists and whether a commensurate charge ordering is allowed.
There- fore, a uniﬁed theory of the Na ordering mechanism may be critical for a better understanding of the electronic structure in this system.
The observed Na ordering pattern2,4 at x =0.5 agrees well with our theoretical prediction,5 and this motivates us to extend our investigation on Na ordering at other compositions studied by recent electron diffraction experiments.4 In this paper, we identify ground state Na or- dering patterns at various compositions and show that the Na ordering is primarily driven by the intraplane screened elec- trostatic interactions.
The details of the electronic structure of the CoO2 plane, on the other hand, have minimal effects.
The compound NaxCoO2 assumes a layered structure which consists of alternating triangular CoO2 and Na planes.
Although there have been reports6–9 of several stacking pat- terns, we shall restrict our discussion to the so-called g phase, which is usually observed for low to intermediate Na compositions.
There are two distinct Na sites within a given plane, denoted as Nas1d and Nas2d sWyckoff indices 2b and 2dd.
The Nas1d site, being directly between two Co ions, is slightly higher in energy than the Nas2d site.5 Therefore, Na ions will normally prefer occupying the Nas2d sites.
We calculate the total energy of 82 ordered structures of NaxCoO2 using ﬁrst principles techniques.
The choice of structures for the ground state search was guided by the MAPS code.10 Our calculations are based on density- functional theory11,12 sDFTd within the local density approxi- mation sLDAd with the Ceperly-Alder exchange-correlation functional.13,14 Ab initio Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials15 are used.
Calculations are performed using the SIESTA code,16,17 which expands the Kohn-Sham wave functions in a linear combination of atomic orbitals sLCAOd.
A double-zeta plus polarization sDZPd basis is used.
The energy cutoff for the charge density grid is 1000 Ry.
The irreducible Brillouin zone is sampled using Monkhorst-Pack grids18 with a density of k points equivalent to 1231232 for a primitive unit cell.
Atomic positions are relaxed until forces are smaller than 0.005 eV/Å. We keep the lattice constants ﬁxed at a =2.82 Å and c=10.89 Å.
Although the lattice constants of NaxCoO2 will vary slightly with Na concentration, our re- sults are not sensitive to this small variation.
The energetics of Na ordering in NaxCoO2 can be studied using the well-stablished formalism for binary alloys.19 The fundamental quantity that determines the stability of a given arrangement h of Na ions and vacancies with Na composi- tion x is the formation energy DEh: DEDFT h = Eh −xENaCoO2 −s1 −xdECoO2, s1d where Eh, ENaCoO2, and ECoO2 are the total energies per site of the structure h, and of the pure compounds NaCoO2 and CoO2, respectively, calculated within DFT.
Figure 1 shows the calculated formation energies of all 82 structures sopen dotsd.
We highlight the ground state structures sred dotsd joined together by the convex hull sred lined.
Structures with formation energy above the convex hull are unstable against phase separation into the two ground states with nearby com- positions.
Red arrows indicate the structures proposed by Zandbergen et al.4 sat x=0.11, x=0.30, x=0.33, x=0.50, x =0.71 and x=0.75d based on electron diffraction experi- ments.
The agreement between theory and experiment is re- markable in that all experimentally proposed structures are indeed ground states within DFT.
Although the structure at x=0.30 appears to be an exception sit is not a ground state within DFTd, it is too close to the convex hull to be neglected as such, given the uncertainties in the calculation.
Moreover, PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 153102 s2005d 1098-0121/2005/71s15d/153102s4d/$23.00 ©2005 The American Physical Society 153102-1we ﬁnd additional ground states at x=0.20, x=0.25, x=0.60, x=0.80 and x=0.83.
A structure at x=0.40 is also too close to the convex hull to be ruled out.
These structures have not been observed experimentally, perhaps because samples at these particular compositions were not analyzed.
An ordered structure at x=0.64 also appears experimentally.4 According to our results, at this composition the sample should be phase-separated between the x=0.60 and the x=0.71 ground states.
All ground state structures and the near ground states at x=0.30 and x=0.40 are depicted in Fig. 2 We also display the lowest energy structure at x=0.67 snot a ground stated, for discussion purposes.
Before discussing in detail the various ordered structures, let us ﬁrst address the driving force for Na ordering in this system.
The simplest explanation would be electrostatics since the Na atoms lose one electron each to the CoO2 net- work, they arrange themselves so as to minimize electrostatic energy.
We perform model calculations to test this hypoth- esis, in which the Ewald sionicd energies of the different arrangements of Na+1 ions are computed.
In these calcula- tions, we assume that the electronic charge is spread over the CoO2 planes neighboring the Na-vacancy layer, which is consistent with our previous calculations.5 Also, the chemical difference between Nas1d and Nas2d sites is simulated by adding an energy e1 per Na ion to the Ewald energies for a Nas1d site.
Therefore, the total energy per unit cell for this electrostatic model is deﬁned as Emodel h = EEwald h + N1 he1, s2d where N1 h is the number of Na atoms in Nas1d sites for the structure h. Figure 3 shows, for each structure, DEDFT h fEq. s1dg versus the calculated formation energy using the above model sDEmodel h d. We clearly see that these two quantities are pro- portional: DEDFT h =kDEmodel h .
The best ﬁt srms deviation of 0.016 eVd is obtained for k=0.514 and an on-site energy difference between Nas1d and Nas2d sites ke1=67 meV.
A value of k smaller than 1 is expected because of screening FIG. 1.

BRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 153102 s2005d 153102-2and partial ionization effects, which are absent from the model calculations and naturally included in the DFT calcu- lations.
Therefore, DFT formation energies can be described with good accuracy by a model of screened electrostatic in- teractions, showing unambiguously that the dominant driving force for Na ordering in NaxCoO2 is electrostatic.
We now discuss the geometries of the structures shown in Fig. 2 In the low concentration regime, we ﬁnd a ground state at x=0.11 s1/9d fFig. 2sbdg, corresponding to an in- plane arrangement of Na “impurities” in a 333 triangular lattice.
Surprisingly, the lowest energy structure corresponds to placing both Na atoms sone in each planed in the less favorable Nas1d sites.
This structure prevails with respect to other arrangements because it minimizes the interplane elec- trostatic energy: The Na atoms can be as far as possible from each other.
Interestingly, this arrangement corresponds to placing each Na atom in the middle of the projections of the three Na atoms of neighboring planes, and it is consistent with the experimental observation of a Î33Î3 superstruc- ture in the diffraction patterns of Ref.
4 if a random stacking of such arrangements occurs.
At x=0.20, the ground state has a Î73Î7 supercell, shown in Fig. 2scd with both Na ions in Nas2d sites.
Periodic repetition of this cell leads to an arrangement of Na ions along rows perpendicular to the f110g direction sthe horizon- tal direction in Fig. 2d.
The distance between Na ions in a row is Î3a.
Such pattern of rows have been experimentally observed for different compositions and have been proposed to be the guiding principle for Na ordering.4 Indeed, we ob- serve this pattern in all other Na compositions except x =1/9, 1/4, and 2/3 snot a ground stated.
The same pattern of rows is observed in the lowest energy structures calculated using the simple electrostatic model.
Therefore, the rows arise naturally from the minimization of electrostatic energy, combined with the constraint that only discrete lattice sites can be occupied by Na ions.
Figure 2sdd shows the ground state for x=0.25, a 232 triangular lattice.
In this case, both Na ions occupy the more preferable Nas2d sites.
In Fig. 2sed the lowest energy struc- ture for x=0.30 is shown.
It has precisely the same in-plane arrangement proposed by Zandbergen et al.4 Again, it corre- sponds to rows of Na ions perpendicular to f110g and all ions occupy Nas2d sites.
As discussed above, it is not a ground state in our calculations sby merely 1 meV/sited.
At x=0.33 s1/3d, the arrangement is again a triangular lattice sÎ33Î3d, as shown in Fig. 2sfd This structure is ex- actly the same as proposed by Zandbergen et al.4 The x =1/3 concentration is of particular interest due to the ob- served superconductivity in the hydrated system at x,0.3.
Although the role water plays is still unknown, the screening of the Na potential by water molecules might suppress the tendency of developing a commensurate charge ordering pat- tern in the CoO2 layer, which may then lead to a more ho- mogeneous electronic system and favor a superconducting state over other competing phases at low temperature.
Pos- sible charge disproportionation and gap opening at this dop- ing level in the unhydrated system has been studied previously.20 However, so far such an insulating state has not been observed.
Figure 2sgd shows the lowest energy arrangement for x =0.40 snot a ground state, by 0.6 meV/sited.
It also follows the rows pattern, and the ratio between Nas1d and Nas2d occupancies is 1.
In Fig. 2shd, the ground state for x=0.50 is shown, which is a Î332 supercell.
The arrangement also follows the pat- tern of rows and it has also been predicted theoretically5 and observed experimentally.4 This structure is particularly stable since all other in-plane arrangements with a similar unit cell at this composition are at least 25 meV/site sor 200 meV/celld higher in energy.
Note again that the ratio between Nas1d and Nas2d occupancies is 1.
This ratio tends to be higher for structures with intermediate composition, since the on-site chemical energy difference between Nas1d and Nas2d sites becomes less important than arranging the Na ions as far as possible to minimize electrostatic energy.
The existence of a particularly stable Na ordering pattern, together with the observed insulating state at this composition,2 strongly indicate an interplay between the Na ordering and the charge ordering in the CoO2 layer in this system.
Our results suggest that, if such an interplay exists, it is more likely that an ordered Na potential drives the charge ordering or enhances this tendency.
Studies of charge order- ing in this system with the presence of a commensurate Na ordering will be reported in a separate paper.
At x=0.60, the ground state structure is again a Î73Î7 supercell, shown in Fig. 2sid with a pattern of rows and a Nas1d/Nas2d occupancy ratio of 1/2.
The composition x =0.67 s2/3d, like x=1/3, has been the subject of many dis- cussions due to its apparent proximity to charge ordering in a triangular lattice.20–22 The lowest energy structure corre- sponds to 331 supercell, shown in Fig. 2sjd.
This structure is clearly lower in energy than any honeycomb arrangement of Na ions.
It is obvious that a honeycomb arrangement would be more compatible with the proposed charge ordering pattern.20–22 Therefore, we propose that the nonexistence of a charge-ordered insulating state at this composition is due to the lack of a stable and commensurate Na ordering.
The ground state structure at x=0.71 s5/7d is shown in Fig. 2skd.
It is impressive that such a complex arrangement with a large supercell sÎ133Î13d corresponds to a ground state structure, as seen experimentally.4 For this structure we have a Nas1d/Nas2d occupancy ratio of 2/3 and once more the rows pattern is followed.
In the high x limit, this pattern becomes simpler to analyze: Low energy structures are com- posed of rows of Nas2d ions intercalated by rows of vacan- cies and Nas1d ions.
For instance, for the x=0.71 structure the repetition is 33Nas2d-vac-23Nas1d-vac.
For x=0.75 we ﬁnd again the same ground state as pro- posed by experiments,4 a Î334 supercell shown in Fig. 2sld.
In this case, the pattern of rows is 33Nas2d-vac-33Nas1d -vac, i.e., there are equal numbers of Nas2d and Nas1d ions.
This structure is lower in energy than that proposed by Shi et al.23 Measurements of local distortions of Nas2dO6 polyhe- dra at x=0.75 have been recently performed by neutron diffraction.24 Apparently, Nas2d ions move to off-center po- sitions, resulting in two long s2.56 Åd and four short s2.32 Åd Na-O bonds.
Our calculated Na-O bond lengths for this structure are 2.57 Å and 2.29 Å, in excellent agreement with experiment.
BRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 153102 s2005d 153102-3At x=0.80 and x=0.83 s5/6d fFigs. 2smd and 2snd, respec- tivelyg we ﬁnd ground-state structures that belong to the same “family” as the x=0.75 structure, i.e., they follow simi- lar row patterns with n3Nas2d-vac-33Nas1d-vac rows in a Î33sn+5d/2 cell, with n=3 for x=0.75, n=5 for x=0.80, and n=7 for x=0.83.
Therefore, it is very likely that beyond x=0.75 one can construct inﬁnitely many ground states spolytipoidsd by simply intercalating odd numbers of Nas2d rows with the sequence of rows -vac-33Nas1d-vac-.
In fact, if one takes into account entropic considerations, it is plau- sible that the thermodynamically stable conﬁguration for x .0.75 will consist of disordered arrangements of such rows.
This result may be related to the order-disorder transition reported at x=0.75 from neutron diffraction experiments.24,3 Finally, for x=1.0 all Nas2d sites are occupied fFig. 2sodg.
In conclusion, we have carried out detailed DFT and model studies on the Na ordering mechanism in NaxCoO2.
The ordering pattern is non-trivial and is sensitive to the Na concentration.
The theoretically determined ordering patterns at various Na compositions agree well with those observed in recent electron diffraction experiments.4 In addition, we identify several ground states that have not yet been ob- served.
Our results indicate that the primary driving force for the Na ordering is the screened electrostatic interactions.
De- tailed electronic structure on the CoO2 layer, on the other hand, plays no important role on the ordering of Na ions since the coupling between the CoO2 plane and the Na plane is much weaker than the intraplane Na-Na interactions.
The converse effects, however, could be signiﬁcant since the charge and magnetic orderings on the CoO2 plane happen at extremely low energy scale5 and may be vulnerable to exter- nal perturbations.
Therefore, it is likely that the particularly stable Na ordering structure at x=0.5 enhances the charge ordering tendency in the CoO2 layer, resulting in a charge ordered insulating state at low temperature as observed experimentally.2 Conversely, the nonexistence of such an in- sulating state at x=2/3 may be due to the absence of an ordered honeycomb arrangement of Na ions at this compo- sition.
