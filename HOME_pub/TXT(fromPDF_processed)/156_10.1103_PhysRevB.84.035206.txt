The samples have been grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy and characterized by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy; high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with capabilities allowing for chemical analysis, including the annular dark-ﬁeld mode and electron energy loss spectroscopy; high-resolution and synchrotron x-ray diffraction; synchrotron extended x-ray absorption ﬁne- structure; synchrotron x-ray absorption near-edge structure; infrared optics; and electron spin resonance.
The results of high-resolution magnetic measurements and their quantitative interpretation have allowed us to verify a series of ab initio predictions on the possibility of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic insulators and to demonstrate that the interaction changes from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic when the charge state of the Mn ions is reduced from 3+ to 2+.

INTRODUCTION The decisive role of holes in ordering the localized spins in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS’s) is not only well established,1–3 but it represents also the basis of the functionalities demonstrated for these systems.4 In view of the fact that most magnetic insulators are either antiferromagnets or ferrimagnets, particularly intriguing is the question whether ferromagnetism is at all possible in dilute magnetic insulators, where carriers remain strongly localized on parent impurities or defects.3,5,6 Actually, a ferromagnetic coupling between localized spins was predicted in a series of ab initio works for the model system (Ga,Mn)N,7 where, as shown in Fig. 1, a large value of the ferromagnetic exchange energy Jnn was calculated for the nearest-neighbor (nn) Mn pairs.
Due to the highly localized character of the orbitals in question, the magnitude of J is expected to decay fast with the interspin distance.
Nevertheless, according to recent Monte Carlo simulations, the predicted Curie temperature TC is as high as 35 and 65 K for the Mn cation concentration x = 3% and 6%, respectively.3 As reviewed elsewhere,8–10 this clear-cut theoretical pre- diction has not yet been veriﬁed experimentally.
Instead, a diversity of magnetic properties has been reported.
For instance, no indication of ferromagnetic interactions was detected up to x = 36% in polycrystalline ﬁlms prepared by ion-assisted deposition,11 whereas TC values ranging from 8 K (Ref. 12) up to over 300 K (Ref. 8) were found for (Ga,Mn)N grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
However, the detection of phase separations13–16 may suggest that the determined TC corresponds to the blocking temperature of magnetic nanoparticles.
It is increasingly clear that further progress in the understanding of this challenging system requires a precise control of both the spatial distribution and the charge state of the Mn ions.9 The samples whose properties are discussed in this pa- per have been grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) according to a procedure described in Sec. II. As detailed in Sec.
III, our ﬁlms have been characterized by the following: secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS); high- resolution (scanning) transmission electron microscopy [HR- (S)TEM] with capabilities allowing for chemical analysis, including energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), high- angle annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) mode, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS); high-resolution and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (SXRD); synchrotron extended x-ray absorp- tion ﬁne-structure (EXAFS); synchrotron x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES); infrared optics; and electron spin resonance (ESR).
This set of probes demonstrates the ab- sence of precipitation, reveals a nonuniform Mn distribution in the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, and shows that the concentration of Mn2+ ions reaches 4 × 1020 cm−3 in (Ga,Mn)N:Si.
From four probe conductance measurements, the sheet resistance is of the order of 10 G at 300 K for the (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlm with the highest Mn content x = 3.1%, where x is the concentration of Mn cations.
By combining this extensive growth and nanocharacteri- zation program with the results of high-precision magnetic measurements discussed in Sec. IV, we demonstrate that the dominant interactions between neighbor Mn pairs are ferromagnetic in (Ga,Mn)N.
However, according to the data, the coupling is too short-ranged to lead to magnetic ordering 035206-1 1098-0121/2011/84(3)/035206(11) ©2011 American Physical SocietyA. BONANNI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 84, 035206 (2011) FIG.

above 1.85 K in the studied Mn concentration range up to x = 3%.
Employing a model of magnetic susceptibility suitable for wurtzite (Ga,Mn)N at high temperatures, and outlined in the Appendix, we evaluate from our experimental results the magnitude of the exchange energy for the nearest- neighbor ferromagnetic coupling.
These ﬁndings allow us to verify the series of ab initio predictions summarized in Fig. 1 on the possibility of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic insulators.
At the same time, we show that the interactions become antiferromagnetic if the Mn charge state is altered by codoping with Si donors, clarifying in this way the array of magnetic properties reported for this system. II.
GROWTH METHOD AND STUDIED SAMPLES In order to increase the Mn concentration in (Ga,Mn)N grown on GaN/c-sapphire by MOVPE at a substrate tem- perature of 850 ◦C,17 here the ﬂow rate of the Ga precursor (TMGa) is reduced to one standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm), maintaining the temperature of the Mn precursor source (MeCp2Mn) at 22 ◦C and its ﬂow rate up to 490 sccm.
In addition to the uniformly doped Mn ﬁlms, we also grow digitally (δ) Mn-doped structures, in which the Mn and Ga precursors are supplied alternately with a period ratio up to 8.
Furthermore, a series of uniformly and digitally Mn-doped samples, respectively, is codoped with Si at a SiH4 ﬂow rate of either 1 or 2 sccm.
The four types of considered samples are denoted by (Ga,Mn)N, (Ga,δMn)N, (Ga,Mn)N:Si, and (Ga,δMn)N:Si, respectively, where with δMn we refer to the Mn digitally doped layers.
In Table I, the list of the studied samples is presented, whose magnetic properties are reported in Figs. 11 and 12 (Sec. IV).
An additional series of samples has been grown onto double-side epiready substrates for optical transmission studies.
The Mn concentration x (xav for the digital structures), as determined by the near-saturation value of the in-plane magnetization M at 50 kOe and 1.85 K, reaches over 3% in the samples with the highest Mn content.

NANOCHARACTERIZATION A. Crystallinity The degree of crystallinity and possible precipitation of secondary crystallographic phases in uniformly and digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms have been assessed by HR-TEM, HR-STEM, HR-XRD, SXRD, and EXAFS.
Our TEM studies have been carried out for all studied ﬁlms on cross-sectional samples prepared by mechanical polishing followed by Ar+ ion milling, under a 4◦angle at 4 kV for less than 2 h. The ion polishing has been performed in a Gatan 691 PIPS system.
The specimens have been investigated in Linz using a JEOL 2011 Fast TEM microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan CCD camera.
The setup is capable of an ultimate point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm, with the possibility to image lattice fringes with a 0.14 nm resolution.
As reported in Fig. 2, for both (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%) samples, low-resolution TEM (left panels) shows no crystallographic phase separation and, in particular, no precipitates’ segregation near the surface or interface.
In fact, the HR-TEM images (right panels) clearly reveal the atomic positions in the lattice and, on the scale displayed, they show a homogeneous crystal ordering and no signs of precipitation within the Mn-doped layers.
To further verify the crystallographic homogeneity of the grown Mn-doped layers, HR-XRD measurements using a materials research diffractometer (MRD) and SXRD were performed.
The HR-XRD experiments have been carried out with a Panalytical X’Pert PRO MRD in Linz at the photon energy of the Cu Kα1 radiation (8 keV) using a hybrid 035206-2EXPERIMENTAL PROBING OF EXCHANGE INTERACTIONS . . .

monochromator with a 0.25◦slit for the incident optics and a pixel detector with an active length of 1 mm (19 channels) in the diffracted beam optics.
The SXRD experiments have been performed at the beamline BM20 (Rossendorf Beam Line) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble using a point detector and 0.5 mm slits in front of the beam at an energy of 10 keV. Radial ω-2θ scans of the GaN (002) to the GaN (004) diffraction peak do not show any trace of secondary phases.
In Fig. 3, the radial scans acquired with both techniques for the same set of samples are shown for comparison, with the MRD scans in the upper panel and the SXRD in the lower one.
The sharp (002) and (004) diffraction peaks of GaN and the (006) diffraction of the sapphire substrate are observed for all samples.
The measurements carried out with the high-energy monochromatic beam at the synchrotron show a better signal-to-noise ratio and less diffuse scattering when compared to those performed with the MRD, but in both cases no trace of crystallographic precipitation can be observed.
The narrow full width at half-maxima (FWHM) of the GaN (002) and (004) peaks (with values between 240 and 290 arcsec) indicate the high crystallinity of the layers.
From the GaN symmetric sharp diffraction peak from the Mn-doped samples—comparable to the one from the GaN reference—we have hints that Mn doping does not affect critically the dislocation density, as conﬁrmed by the HR-TEM analysis on the same samples.
The XAFS measurements at the Mn K edge (6539 eV) have been carried out at the GILDA Italian collaborating research group beamline (BM08) of the ESRF in Grenoble, according to the experimental procedure detailed previously.17,18 Both FIG.

EXAFS and XANES regions of the collected spectra have been analyzed.
Three representative samples have been studied: (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%), (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%), and (Ga,Mn)N:Si (x = 3.3%).
The collected data, with the po- larization vector parallel to the c axis, and the relative ﬁts resulting from the EXAFS analysis are shown in Fig. 4.
The structural model employed consists of one Mn atom substituting Ga in a GaN wurtzite crystal plus a Mn-Mn contribution taken from the MnN crystal structure19 with a ﬁtted coordination number (NMn-Mn) in order to account for possible Mn clusters.
The quantitative results are reported in Table II and they are equivalent within the error bars for all the samples.
The agreement with experimental data is good up to several coordination shells—as seen in Fig. 4— demonstrating the substitutional incorporation of Mn.
The presence of an additional Mn-Mn coordination can be excluded within an uncertainty of 0.4 neighbors.
Considering that the typical metal-metal coordination numbers are around 10 (12 Mn neighbors in MnN, 8 in Mn3N2), we can exclude the presence of secondary phases with a precision of about 5%.
In addition, the possible Mn incorporation in interstitial sites (tetrahedral and octahedral) has been investigated, statistically 035206-3A. BONANNI et al.

These results are equivalent to the XAFS structural analysis on our (Ga,Mn)N samples at lower concentrations.17 In conclusion, TEM, HR-(S)TEM, HR-XRD, SXRD, and EXAFS studies demonstrate a single-crystal character of the considered ﬁlms with no traces, down to the atomic scale, of precipitations (crystallographic phase separation).
This is in contrast with the case of some (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms grown by MBE (Refs.
14 and 21) as well as with (Ga,Fe)N layers obtained by MOVPE,18,22–24 for which crystallographic phase separations were detected by employing the same nanocharacterization tools.
B. Mn distribution The Mn distribution along the growth direction and the Si distribution in the codoped ﬁlms have been evaluated in Warsaw via SIMS, calibrated by Mn-implanted GaN, providing the absolute concentration of Mn atoms with an accuracy of about a factor 2.

Quantitative results of the EXAFS analysis.
For each sample, the ﬁtted parameters are as follows: the common amplitude (S2 0), the average bond distances from the central Mn to the 4 nearest neighbors (RMn-N) and 12 Ga next nearest neighbors (RMn-Ga) of the wurtzite structure plus a common expansion parameter for higher coordination shells (R), and the coordination number (NMn-Mn) for the Mn-Mn bond distance at 2.98(2) ˚A.
The Debye-Waller parameters attest all below 8(2) × 10−3 ˚A−2 and a correlated Debye model20 with a temperature of 500(50) K is used for the GaN multiple scattering contributions.

in Fig. 5 for the present ﬁlms indicate that the Mn distribution is uniform over the Mn-doped region and that the interface between the (Ga,Mn)N overlayer and the GaN buffer layer is sharp.
This is conﬁrmed by chemical analysis performed in Linz with an Oxford Inca EDS system, which—with the sensitivity of 0.1% at.—does not provide any evidence for Mn diffusion into the nominally undoped GaN buffer.
For further characterization of the Mn doping, HAADF- STEM and EELS measurements have been performed—and are reported in Fig. 6—employing a FEI Tecnai F 20 200 kV transmission electron microscope in Graz.
The STEM images and EELS spectra could be recorded with an upgraded spectrometer with an adapted STEM detection geometry, optimized for Z contrast and enhanced spectral collection EELS efﬁciency.25,26 In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the high spatial resolution in question as well as to keep exposure times low for minimal sample drift, the EELS point spectra have been taken as an integral sum over the energy.
Accordingly, a possible ﬁne structure located within the ﬁrst 20–30 eV around the ionization threshold energy of an edge has been averaged out.
The HAADF-STEM on (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and re- ported in Fig. 6(a) reveals a clear change in intensity when going from the substrate into the Mn-doped layer (from left to right), while within the doped layer no chemical contrast could be detected.
The EELS spectra given in Fig. 6(b) evidence the presence of Mn only in the nominally Mn-doped layer.
In contrast, remarkably, as shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(e), HAADF-STEM observations on the digital (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%) reveal intensity modulations.
Additional EELS point spectra collected in Fig. 6(d) show the signal differences of the Mn L23 edge between the substrate and the intensity modulated lines.
In conclusion, the element-speciﬁc analysis demonstrates a spatially homogeneous Mn distribution over the volume of the uniformly Mn-doped (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms, with no segregation toward the surface, interface, or buffer regions.
In contrast, in the case of the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, nanoscale density modulation with a period imposed by the growth conditions 035206-4EXPERIMENTAL PROBING OF EXCHANGE INTERACTIONS . . .

As discussed in Sec.
IV, such a nonrandom distribution of Mn ions increases the apparent Curie constant, particularly if the system is close to a ferromagnetic instability.

Following recent works on the Mn charge state in GaN,27 the effect of codoping by Si donors on the Mn charge state has been quantitatively assessed by examining the magnitude of the intra-ion optical absorption, which occurs at E0 ≈1.4 eV for Mn3+ ions in GaN.28–31 Optical investigations have been performed in Warsaw and in Linz for two series of ﬁlms, abridged in Table III, with the Mn concentrations x ≈1.8 and 0.5%, respectively, and different Si content.
The series with the lower Mn concentration has been designed for transmission and ESR measurements with the layers deposited on double- side epiready sapphire substrates.
As can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the Si doping quenches the intra-ion absorption, speciﬁc to Ga-substitutional Mn in the 3+ charge state.

The refractive index of GaN is modeled using the Sellmeier equation33 and the refractive index of the sapphire is set at 1.8.
The thicknesses of the GaN buffer and (Ga,Mn)N layer are adjusted to reproduce the observed Fabry-P´erot interferences at a magnitude of thicknesses ratio as determined during the growth by in situ ellipsometry.
In Table III, the ﬁtted values of the parameters in Eq. (1) are given.
From the reduction of the Mn3+ absorption we can evaluate the concentration of Mn2+ ions assuming that elec- trons coming from Si shallow donors occupy the Mn2+/Mn3+ midgap level.
Under this assumption, the concentration of Mn2+ ions reaches a level of 4 × 1020 per cm3 for the highest employed ﬂow of the Si precursor at the lowest Ga precursor ﬂow.
Results of ESR studies carried out in Linz and reported in Fig. 9 for (Ga,Mn)N and (Ga,Mn)N:Si with the Mn concentration x ≈0.5% demonstrate the emergence of a characteristic Mn2+ signal upon Si doping.
In ﬁlms with higher Mn concentrations, the line broadening, witnessing the presence of Mn2+-Mn3+ coupling, as discussed in Sec.
IV, has hampered the detection of a Mn2+ signal.
A nonzero value of the orbital momentum, and the asso- ciated spin-orbit interaction speciﬁc to Mn3+ ions, precludes FIG. 9.

their observation by ESR (Ref. 27).
At the same time, Mn2+ ions, corresponding to orbital singlets, give rise to a speciﬁc ESR response.27,34 The results of the optical and ESR studies are conﬁrmed also by XANES.
In order to contribute to the determination of the Mn valence state, the position of the x-ray absorption edge and the pre-edge features have been considered as described in the XANES section of Ref. 17.
In particular here the issue of reduction of the charge state is addressed.
As can be appreciated in Fig. 10, a shift toward lower energies is visible for the Si codoped sample, while the position of the pre-edge peaks remains unchanged.
This demonstrates the ﬁne calibration of the incoming energy and suggests the presence of some Mn in a valence state lower than 3+, possibly 2+.
Due to the lack of model compounds that would allow us to establish a precise relation between the edge shift and the valence state in nitrides, a quantitative statement cannot be given here.
However, considering that in the case of sixfold-coordinated Mn ions (this example is taken as no data are reported for tetragonal Mn3+) the ionic radius of Mn2+ is about 12% greater than the one of Mn3+ (Ref. 35) and that no visible evolution of the Mn-N distance is reported, we can expect a minority of Mn ions to be in the 2+ charge state.
In conclusion, our SIMS, optical, XANES, and ESR studies show consistently that co-doping with Si increases the concentration of Mn ions in the 2+ charge state, which for the highest employed ﬂow of the Si precursor (2 sccm) and the lowest Ga precursor ﬂow is up to 4 × 1020 cm−3, about 30% of the total Mn concentration for x = 3%.
This evaluation substantiates the experimental data presented in the next section.
It is worth noting that a coexistence of Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions was detected also in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in (Ga,Mn)N samples undoped with Si,36 pointing to the presence of residual or interfacial compensating donors. IV.
MAGNETIC PROPERTIES According to our previous studies of (Ga,Mn)N with x < 1%,17 the dependence of the magnetization M on temperature T , magnetic ﬁeld H, and its orientation with respect to the wurtzite (wz) c axis can accurately be described in terms 035206-6EXPERIMENTAL PROBING OF EXCHANGE INTERACTIONS . . .

of noninteracting Mn3+ ions substitutional of Ga.
The good agreement between the experimental data and the model conﬁrms a weak compensation by residual impurities, which, if present, would change the Mn charge state and thus the magnetic properties.
The Mn3+ charge state is preserved in samples with higher Mn concentrations, where the persistence of a large anisotropy between the M(H) values at 1.85 K for the two sample orientations c ⊥H and c ∥H is evidenced in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b).
However, a gradual enhancement of M(H)/M(50 kOe) over the magnitude expected for non- interacting spins is observed when increasing x up to 3% in both uniformly and digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, as seen in Figs. 11(a), 11(b), and 12(a).
These results demonstrate univocally that, in spite of the absence of band carriers, the dominant exchange interaction between Mn3+ is ferromag- netic in (Ga,Mn)N. Interestingly, a rather different behavior is observed in the case of (Ga,Mn)N:Si, where the trapping of donor electrons changes the Mn charge from 3+ to 2+ and the spin state S from 2 to 5/2, for about 30% of the Mn ions at x ≈3%, as discussed in Sec.
III C. According to the data collected in Figs. 11(c), 11(d), and 12(b), the increasing concentration of Mn2+ ions results in the foreseen decrease of the magnetization anisotropy.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 12(b), M(H) satu- rates slower than theoretically anticipated for noninteracting Mn ions.
This ﬁnding points to an antiferromagnetic character of the exchange coupling between Mn2+ ions, and suggests that these ions may dominate in (Ga,Mn)N, when no ferromagnetic interactions are detected.11,37 In the insets to Figs. 11(a)–11(d) , the results of our search for the onset of a collective magnetic behavior in the samples with the highest Mn concentrations are given.
A linear and a hysteretic M(H) dependence in weak magnetic ﬁelds is observed for both conﬁgurations, c ⊥H and c ∥H, pointing to the absence of spontaneous magnetization.
These data imply that the ferromagnetic spin-spin couplings are too short-ranged to result in magnetic ordering and, hence, in spontaneous magnetization at T ⩾1.85 K. Quantitative information on Jnn is gained here by examining the dependence on the inverse temperature of the in-plane FIG. 11.

As reported in Fig. 13, χ(T ) ≡M/H ∼ 1/T for 150 ≲T ⩽350 K. This behavior indicates that the contribution to the magnetic susceptibility from the (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms obeys the Curie law in this regime, χ(T ) = C/T .
This dependence is expected if the spin pairs are either uncorrelated, |Jnn|S2 ≪kBT , or strongly bound, |Jnn|S2 ≫kBT . FIG. 12.

Solid lines serve to determine the Curie constants at high temperatures.
Deviations of their values from zero at 1/T = 0 show the accuracy of the substrate subtraction.
In order to extract from these data the magnitude of Jnn, we extend the previous model of a single substitutional Mn3+ impurity in GaN (Ref. 17) by considering a pair of Mn3+ ions coupled by an exchange interaction −J ⃗S1 ⃗S2,38,39 the model discussed in detail in the Appendix.
Assuming a random distribution of Mn over the cation hcp lattice, and allowing for the coupling between nn spins, we can evaluate M(T,H) at a given Jnn and x.
This approach implies, in particular, that for x = 3%, T < 350 K, and H = 1 kOe, χ(T ) = C/T if Jnn > 10 meV. However, in this case, due to the proportionality of χ(T ) to the pair spin square, the magnitude of C is enhanced in comparison to the value C0 corresponding to noninteracting spins.
To evaluate experimentally Cnorm = C/C0, we consider that its magnitude can be determined from the magnetic moment m(T,1 kOe) measured in-plane without knowing the exact value of the volume occupied by the Mn spins if the magnitude of the in-plane m(1.85 K,50 kOe) is employed to obtain the Mn content x—and thus C0—for particular samples.
Following the outcome of the experi- mental results for (Ga,Mn)N:Si (Sec.
III C), demonstrating the presence of Mn2+ ions, their relative contribution to M(T,H) is determined from the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy.
As summarized in Fig. 14, Cnorm > 1 for all studied sam- ples, hinting to the presence of a considerable ferromagnetic spin-spin interaction.
The theory presented in the Appendix describes quite well the magnitude of Cnorm(x) for the uniformly doped (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms, pointing to Jnn > 10 meV, in general agreement with the results of the ab initio studies outlined in Fig. 1.
Furthermore, a low-temperature upturn of the experimental points over the C/T dependence, visible in Fig. 13 below ∼100 K, suggests the existence of an additional weak ferromagnetic coupling between more distant neighbors.
Moreover, the experimental values of Cnorm(x) in the case of digital δMn-doping are higher than theoretically expected. FIG. 14.
(Color online) Normalized Curie constant Cnorm as a function of the Mn content for uniformly (solid symbols) and digitally (open symbols) doped (Ga,Mn)N (circles) and (Ga,Mn)N:Si (triangles).
The solid lines are computed assuming a random distribution of Mn3+ ions, and either ferromagnetic or antiferromag- netic strong coupling between the nearest-neighbor (nn) Mn spins, |Jnn|S2 ≫kBT .
Dashed and dotted lines are calculated assuming that 4 × 1020 cm−3 Mn ions are in the 2+ charge state, and nn interactions are ferromagnetic except for nn Mn2+ pairs, for which Jnn = 0 or −JnnS2 ≫kBT , respectively.
In order to clarify the different magnitude of Cnorm in uniformly and digitally doped ﬁlms, we refer to Sec.
III B, where the detailed investigation of the Mn distribution for the two samples with the highest Mn concentration, namely (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and the digital (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%), respectively, have been shown.
The data demonstrate the presence of a spatially modulated Mn concentration in the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms.
Due to a nonlinear dependence of the Curie constant on the Mn concentration in the presence of ferromagnetic interactions, such a nonrandom distribution of Mn ions increases the apparent value of Cnorm, particularly if the system is close to a ferromagnetic instability.
This interpretation is supported by a much smaller effect in the ﬁlms with lower values of xav, and thus far from the ferromagnetic instability.
Finally, we comment on the magnitudes of Cnorm(x) in Si-doped samples.
Here, we have ferromagnetically coupled Mn3+-Mn3+ and Mn3+-Mn2+ pairs as well as antiferromag- netically interacting Mn2+-Mn2+ pairs.
As shown in Fig. 14, the theory developed for such a case and summarized in the Appendix is consistent with the data for Si-doped samples.
V. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have veriﬁed experimentally the presence of a strong ferromagnetic coupling between neighboring Mn spins in (Ga,Mn)N, supporting a very signiﬁcant number of ab initio studies.3,5,7 Since the Mott-Hubbard localization pre- cludes carrier hopping between magnetic ions, a ferromagnetic superexchange constitutes the relevant microscopic coupling mechanism.40 However, according to our ﬁndings, the range of this interaction is too short to produce a long-range ferromag- netic ordering—at least above 1.85 K—in samples with 3% of randomly distributed substitutional Mn cations.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 84, 035206 (2011) with Si may a priori result in a ferromagnetic double ex- change, but apparently Anderson-Mott localization in the Mn impurity band renders this mechanism inefﬁcient in the range of Mn contents explored so far by us.
If, owing to a large density of donorlike defects or impurities, the concentration of Mn2+ prevails, antiferromagnetic superexchange becomes the dominant spin-spin coupling mechanism.
This situation has presumably taken place in recently studied (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms with x up to 36% (Ref. 11) and some time ago in the case of In1−xMnxAs layers with x up to 18%.41 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work was supported by FunDMS Advanced Grant of ERC (Grant No. 227690) within the Ideas 7th Frame- work Programme of European Community, InTechFun (Grant No.

APPENDIX: THEORETICAL EVALUATION OF THE CURIE CONSTANT We evaluate the Curie constant Cnorm for a random distri- bution of the Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions.
While our model can be applied for a general situation, we discuss the case describing our data in the relevant temperature range 150 ≲T ⩽350 K, i.e., we assume that the nearest-neighbor (nn) Mn3+-Mn3+ and Mn3+-Mn2+ pairs form ferromagnetically oriented dimers, whereas nn Mn2+-Mn2+ pairs are uncoupled.
In the paramagnetic region well above the ordering temper- ature (high-temperature limit), the magnetic susceptibility is expected to obey the Curie-Weiss law , χ = C0 T −θC , (A1) C0 = N (gμB)2S(S + 1) 3kB , (A2) where C and θC are the Curie constant and Curie-Weiss temperature, and N is the concentration of magnetic ions with spin S.
However, in random magnetic alloys, where the interactions between spin pairs show a large dispersion owing to strong variations of the spin-spin distances, the magnitudes of C and θC may depend on the temperature.38,39,42 We consider the case of dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS’s) and dilute magnetic oxides (DMO’s).
In the absence of band carriers that could mediate long-range spin-spin interactions, the strength of the exchange couplings decays rather fast with the spin-spin distance.
In such a case, the exchange between magnetic ions occupying the nn cation positions dominates.
Accordingly, below the percolation limit for the nn interaction (x ≲18% for fcc and hcp lattices), the magnetic response can be evaluated as a sum of contributions coming from various types of clusters: isolated spins, nn pairs, nn triads,. .
., whose relative importance depends on x.39 The magnetic response of such small clusters can be easily calculated for given values of the exchange integral Jnn, temperature T , and magnetic ﬁeld H. Possible interactions between more distant pairs of magnetic ions are neglected within this approach.
Qualitatively, at low temperatures, kBT ≪|Jnn|, at which the nn pairs are locked, the Curie constant is reduced (C < C0) or enhanced (C > C0) for antiferromagnetic interactions (Jnn < 0) and ferromagnetic interactions (Jnn > 0), respectively.
We are interested in the case of (Ga,Mn)N and (Ga,Mn)N:Si where, in general, both Mn2+ (S = 5/2) and Mn3+ (S = 2) ions are present with the concentrations xMn2+ and xMn3+, respectively (x = xMn2+ + xMn3+).
Here, we have ferromag- netically coupled Mn3+-Mn3+ and Mn3+-Mn2+ pairs as well as antiferromagnetically interacting Mn2+-Mn2+ pairs.
To describe this case, we generalize the approach put forward previously for II-VI DMS’s.39 The probability that a given spin, e.g., a Mn3+ ion, is in a cluster belonging to the conﬁguration rcl is given by Prcl = nrcl(xMn2+)nMn2+(xMn3+)nMn3+−1(1 −x)υrcl , (A3) where nMn2+ and nMn3+ are the numbers of manganese ions in 2+ and 3+ charge states belonging to this cluster, and nrcl, υrcl are parameters taken from Refs. 39 and 43.
Then one should take into account all possible combinations of arrangements of Mn2+ ions within rcl and calculate the total spin Scl corresponding to the ground state (assuming that |Jnn| ≫kBT ).
In the case of vanishing interactions between Mn2+ ions, we have to compute also the effective cluster size ncl (some of the ions may be disconnected from the initial cluster because of JMn2+−Mn2+ = 0).
In this way, we obtain the probability matrix PScl,ncl from which the Curie constant can be calculated, C = xN0 (gμB)2 3kB  Scl,ncl PScl,nclScl(Scl + 1) ncl , (A4) where N0 is the cation concentration.
In order to obtain the magnetization M(T,H) of (Ga,Mn)N in the presence of interacting nn magnetic centers, we extend the previous model of a single substitutional Mn3+ impurity in GaN (Refs. 17, 29, and 44) by considering a pair of Mn3+ ions coupled by an exchange interaction H(12) = −Jnn ⃗S1 ⃗S2.
Then, the energy structure of such a pair can be described by the Hamiltonian H = H(1) + H(2) + H(12), (A5) where H(i) (i = 1,2) accounts for the single Mn3+ ion (L = 2, S = 2) in GaN with the trigonal crystal ﬁeld of the wurtzite structure and the Jahn-Teller distortion taken into account (for details, see Ref. 17).
In the coupling scheme employed, the base states for the pair are characterized by the set of quantum numbers |mL1,mS1,mL2,mS2⟩.
The energy level scheme is calculated by a numerical diagonalization of the full 625 × 625 Hamiltonian (A5) matrix, which allows us to obtain an average magnetic moment of the Mn ion belonging to the pair (mpairs).
Assuming a random distribution of Mn ions over the cation sites (the hcp lattice) and allowing for the coupling between the nn spins, we can then evaluate M(T,H) at given Jnn and x, M = μBxN0  ⟨msingles⟩Pncl=1 + ⟨mpairs⟩  1 −Pncl=1  .
