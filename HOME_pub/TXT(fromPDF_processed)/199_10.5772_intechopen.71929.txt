Introduction The atomic interaction is of essential importance in the numerical investigation of most physical or mechanical processes [1].
The present work provides parameters for the Stillinger-Weber (SW) empirical potential for 156 two-dimensional atomic crystals (TDACs).
In practical applications, these layered materials are usually played as Lego on atomic scale to construct the van der Waals heterostructures with comprehensive properties [2].
The computational cost of ab initio for the heterostructure will be substantially increased as compared with one individual atomic layer, because the unit cell for the heterostructure is typically very large resulting from the mismatch of the lattice constants of different layered components.
The empirical potential will be a competi- tive alternative to help out this difficult situation, considering their high efficiency.

In the early stage before 1980s, the computation ability of the scientific community was quite limited.
At that time, the valence force field (VFF) model was one popular empirical potential for the description of the atomic interaction, since the VFF model is linear and can be applied in the analytic derivation of most elastic quantities [3].
In this model, each VFF term corresponds to a particular motion style in the crystal.
Hence, each parameter in the VFF model usually has clear physical essence, which is beneficial for the parameterization of this model.
For instance, the bond stretching term in the VFF model is directly related to the frequency of the longitudi- nal optical phonon modes, so the force constant of the bond stretching term can be determined from the frequencies of the longitudinal optical phonon modes.
The VFF model can thus serve as the starting point for developing atomic empirical potentials for different crystals.
While the VFF model is beneficial for the fastest numerical simulation, its strong limitation is the absence of nonlinear effect.
Due to this limitation, the VFF model is not applicable to nonlinear phenomena, for which other potential models with nonlinear components are required.
Some representative potential models are (in the order of their simulation costs) SW potential [4], Tersoff potential [5], Brenner potential [6], ab initio approaches, etc.
The SW potential is one of the simplest potential forms with nonlinear effects included.
An advanced feature for the SW potential is that it includes the nonlinear effect, and keeps the numerical simulation at a very fast level.
Considering its distinct advantages, the present article aims at providing the SW potential for 156 TDACs.
We will determine parameters for the SW potential from the VFF model, follow- ing the analytic approach proposed by one of the present authors (JWJ) [7].
The VFF constants are fitted to the phonon spectrum or the elastic properties in the TDACs.
In this paper, we parametrize the SW potential for 156 TDACs.

2. VFF model and SW potential 2.1.
VFF model The VFF model is one of the most widely used linear models for the description of atomic interactions [3].
The bond stretching and the angle bending are two typical motion styles for most covalent bonding materials.
The bond stretching describes the energy variation for a bond due to a bond variation Δr ¼ r  r0, with r0 as the initial bond length.
The angle bending gives the energy increment for an angle resulting from an angle variation Δθ ¼ θ  θ0, with θ0 as the initial angle.
In the VFF model, the energy variations for the bond stretching and the angle bending are described by the following quadratic forms, Vr ¼ 1 2 KrðΔrÞ2, (1) Vθ ¼ 1 2 KθðΔθÞ2, (2) where Kr and Kθ are two force constant parameters.
These two potential expressions in Eqs.
(1) and (2) are directly related to the optical phonon modes in the crystal.
Hence, their force constant parameters Kr and Kθ are usually determined by fitting to the phonon dispersion. 2.2.
SW potential In the SW potential, energy increments for the bond stretching and angle bending are described by the following two-body and three-body forms, V2ðrijÞ ¼ AðB=rij  1Þe½r=ðrijrmaxÞ, (3) V3ðθijkÞ ¼ Ke½r1=ðrijrmax12Þþr2=ðrikrmax13Þ ðcosθijk  cosθ0Þ2 (4) where V2 corresponds to the bond stretching and V3 associates with the angle bending.
The cut-offs rmax, rmax12, and rmax13 are geometrically determined by the material’s structure.
There are five unknown geometrical parameters, i.e., r and B in the two-body V2 term and r1, r2, and θ0 in the three-body V3 term, and two energy parameters A and K. There is a constraint among these parameters due to the equilibrium condition [7], Borophene Table 9.
The structure is shown in Figure 323.
Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 4r ¼ 4Bðd  rmaxÞ2 ðBd  d5Þ , (5) where d is the equilibrium bond length from experiments.
Eq. (5) ensures that the bond has an equilibrium length d and the V2 interaction for this bond is at the energy minimum state at the equilibrium configuration.
The energy parameters A and K in the SW potential can be analytically derived from the VFF model as follows, A ¼ Kr αe½r=ðdrmaxÞ , (6) K ¼ Kθ 2 sin 2θ0e½r1=ðd1rmax12Þþr2=ðd2rmax13Þ , (7) where the coefficient α in Eq. (6) is, α ¼ r ðd  rmaxÞ2 " #2 ðB=d4  1Þ þ 2r ðd  rmaxÞ3 " # ðB=d4  1Þ þ r ðd  rmaxÞ2 " # 8B d5   þ 20B d6   : (8) In some situations, the SW potential is also written into the following form, V2ðrijÞ ¼ EALðBLσprp ij  σqrq ij Þe½σ=ðrijaσÞ, (9) V3ðθijkÞ ¼ Eλe½γσ=ðrijaσÞþγσ=ðrjkaσÞ ðcosθijk  cosθ0Þ2: (10) The parameters here can be determined by comparing the SW potential forms in Eqs.
(9) and (10) with Eqs. (3) and (4).
It is obvious that p = 4 and q = 0. Eqs.
(9) and (10) have two more parameters than Eqs.
(3) and (4), so we can set E = 1.0 eV and γ = 1.0.
The other parameters in Eqs.
(9) and (10) are related to these parameters in Eqs.
(3) and (4) by the following equations AL ¼ A, (11) σ ¼ r, (12) BL ¼ B=r4, (13) a ¼ rmax=r, (14) λ ¼ K: (15) Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 5The SW potential is implemented in GULP using Eqs. (3) and (4).
The SW potential is implemented in LAMMPS using Eqs. (9) and (10).
In the rest of this article, we will develop the VFF model and the SW potential for layered crystals.
The VFF model will be developed by fitting to the phonon dispersion from experi- ments or first-principles calculations.
The SW potential will be developed following the above analytic parameterization approach.
In this work, GULP [8] is used for the calculation of phonon dispersion and the fitting process, while LAMMPS [9] is used for molecular dynamics simulations.
The OVITO [10] and XCRYSDEN [11] packages are used for visualization.
All simulation scripts for GULP and LAMMPS are available online in [1]. 3.
1H-SCO2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-ScO2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-ScO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-ScO2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Sc and X = O).
Each Sc atom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., Figure 1.

The unit cell is highlighted by a red parallelogram.
(b) Enlarged view of atoms in the blue box in (a).
Each M atom is surrounded by six X atoms, which are categorized into the top and bottom groups.
Atoms X 1, 3, and 5 are from the top group, while atoms X 2, 4, and 6 are from the bottom group.
M atoms are represented by larger gray balls.
X atoms are represented by smaller yellow balls.
Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 6atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each O atom is connected to three Sc atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], including the lattice constant a = 3.16 Å and the bond length dScO ¼ 2:09 Å.
The resultant angles are θScOO ¼ θOScSc ¼ 98:222 and θScOO0 ¼ 58:398, in which atoms O and O0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 10 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-ScO2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along ГM as shown in Figure 2(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
Figure 2(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 11.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 12.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 13.
We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-ScO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Sc in Figure 1 (with M = Sc and X = O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS pack- age.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 3 (with M = Sc and X = O) shows that, for 1H-ScO2, we can differentiate these angles around the Sc atom by assigning these six neighboring O atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all six neighbors around one Sc atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H-ScO2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 4 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-ScO2 of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer 1H-ScO2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-ScO2.

Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 8Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 126.3 and 125.4 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:16.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-ScO2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 652.8 and 683.3 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 12.2 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.19 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 11.7 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. Figure 3.

Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 12Young’s modulus is 43.8 and 43.2 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:30.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-ScS2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 146.9 and 159.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 6.1 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 5.9 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.32 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 5.
1H-SCSE2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-ScSe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-ScSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-ScSe2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Sc and X = Se).
Each Sc atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Se atom is connected to three Sc atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], includ- ing the lattice constant a = 3.38 Å and the bond length dScSe ¼ 2:65 Å.
The resultant angles are θScSeSe ¼ θSeScSc¼ 92:859 ∘and θScSeSe0¼ 66:432 ∘, in which atoms Se and Se0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 18 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-ScSe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 7(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
Figure 7(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS pack- age.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = Sc and X = Se) shows that, for 1H-ScSe2, we can differentiate these angles around the Sc atom by assigning these six neighboring Se atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all six neighbors around one Sc atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H- ScSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K.

The single-layer 1H-ScSe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-ScSe2.

The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
There is only one (longitudinal) acoustic branch available.
We find that the VFF parameters can be chosen to be the same as that of the 1H-ScSe2, from which the longitudinal acoustic branch agrees with the ab initio results as shown in Figure 9(a).

The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 47.9 and 47.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:29.
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-TiTe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 158.6 and 176.3 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 6.6 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 6.3 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 8.
1H-VO2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-VO2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-VO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-VO2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Vand X = O).
Each Vatom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each O atom is connected to three Vatoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], including the lattice constant a ¼ 2:70 Å and the bond length dVO ¼ 1:92 Å.
The resultant angles are θVOO ¼ θOVV ¼ 89:356 and θVOO0 ¼ 71:436, in which atoms O and O0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 30 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-VO2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 13(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].

We note that 12 atom types have beenintroducedforthesimulationofthesingle-layer1H-VO2usingLAMMPS,because the angles around atom V in Figure 1 (with M = Vand X = O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it isnot soconvenientforsomeusersto implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differenti- ate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = Vand X = O) shows that, for 1H-VO2, we can differentiate these angles around the Vatom by assigning these six neighboring O atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all six neighbors around one Vatom.

We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-VTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom V in Figure 1 (with M = Vand X = Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional con- straints inLAMMPS, whichcan be accomplished by modifying thesource file of LAMMPS[13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = V and X = Te) shows that, for 1H-VTe2, we can differentiate these angles around the V atom by assigning these six neighboring Te atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Vatom.

The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 90.0 and 89.0 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
These values are in reasonably agreement with the ab initio results, e.g., 88.0 N/m from [18], or 87.9 N/m from [19].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:30, which agrees with the ab initio value of 0.30 [18, 19].

Each Te atom is connected to three Cr atoms.
The structural parameters are from [12], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:39 Å and the bond length dCrdTe ¼ 2:58 Å.
The resultant angles are θCrTeTe ¼ θTeCrCr ¼ 82:139 and θCrTeTe0 ¼ 81:316, in which atoms Te and Te’ are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 58 shows three VFF terms for the 1H-CrTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 27(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
Figure 27(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-FeO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Fe in Figure 1 (with M = Fe and X = O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS pack- age.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = Fe and X = O) shows that, for 1H-FeO2, we can differentiate these angles around the Fe atom by assigning these six neighboring O atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Fe atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H-FeO2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K.

Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 60There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-FeTe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 267.5 and 302.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 8.6 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.22 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 8.1 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 21.

In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-CoTe2.

Each Co atom is surrounded by six Te atoms.

Table 82 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-CoTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 39(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [12].
Figure 39(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-CoTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Co in Figure 1 (with M=Co and X=Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by mod- ifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M=Co and X=Te) shows that, for 1H-CoTe2, we can differentiate these angles around the Co atom by assigning these six neigh- boring Te atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Co atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H-CoTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K.

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-NiSe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 173.9 and 197.6 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 6.1 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 5.9 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 24.

Each Ni atom is surrounded by six Te atoms.
These Te atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Te atom is connected to three Ni atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], includ- ing the lattice constant a ¼ 3:59 Å and the bond length dNiTe ¼ 2:54 Å.
The resultant angles are θNiTeTe ¼ θTeNiNi ¼ 89:933 and θNiTeTe0 ¼ 70:624, in which atoms Te and Te’ are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 94 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-NiTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 45(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [12].
The lowest acoustic branch (flexural mode) is almost linear in the ab initio calculations, which may be due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance [20].
The transverse acoustic branch is very close to the longitudinal acoustic branch in the ab initio calculations.
Figure 45(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 95.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 96.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 97.
We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-NiTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Ni in Figure 1 (with M=Ni and X=Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by mod- ifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M=Ni and X=Te) shows that, for 1H-NiTe2, we can differentiate these angles around the Ni atom by assigning these six neigh- boring Te atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Ni atom.

1H-NBS2 In 1983, the VFF model was developed to investigate the lattice dynamical properties in the bulk 2H-NbS2 [21].
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-NbS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-NbS2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M=Nb and X=S).
Each Nb atom is surrounded by six S atoms.
These S atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each S atom is connected to three Nb atoms.
The structural parameters are from Ref.
[21], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:31 Å and the bond length dNbS ¼ 2:47 Å.
The resultant angles are θNbSS ¼ θSNbNb ¼ 84:140 and θNbSS0 ¼ 78:626, in which atoms S and S’ are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 98 shows four VFF terms for the 1H-NbS2; one of which is the bond stretching interac- tion shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 47(a).
The theoretical phonon frequencies (gray pentagons) are from Ref.
[21], which are the phonon dispersion of bulk 2H-NbS2.
We have used these phonon frequencies as the phonon dispersion of the single- layer 1H-NbS2, as the interlayer interaction in the bulk 2H-NbS2 only induces weak effects on the two in-plane acoustic branches.
The interlayer coupling will strengthen the out-of-plane acoustic branch (flexural branch), so the flexural branch from the present VFF model (blue line) is lower than the theoretical results for bulk 2H-NbS2 (gray pentagons).
Figure 47(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 99.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 100.

The single-layer 1H-NbSe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-NbSe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 80.2 and 80.7 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:29.
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-NbSe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 258.8 and 306.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 11.2 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 10.7 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 27.
1H-MoO2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-MoO2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-MoO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-MoO2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = O).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each O atom is connected to three Mo atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], including the lattice constant a ¼ 2:78 Å and the bond length dMoO ¼ 2:00 Å.
The resultant angles are θMoOO ¼ θOMoMo ¼ 88:054 and θMoOO0 ¼ 73:258, in which atoms O and O0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 106 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-MoO2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq.

The fourth line gives the initial bond length (in the unit of Å) for the bond stretching interaction and the initial angle (in the unit of degrees) for the angle bending interaction.

These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 51(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [12].
Figure 51(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 107.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 108.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 109.
We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-MoO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].

Figure 2 (with M = Mo and X = O) shows that, for 1H-MoO2, we can differentiate these angles around the Mo atom by assigning these six neighboring O atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Mo atom.

1H-MoS2 Several potentials have been proposed to describe the interaction for the single-layer 1H-MoS2.
In 1975, Wakabayashi et al. developed a VFF model to calculate the phonon spectrum of the bulk 2H-MoS2 [22].
In 2009, Liang et al. parameterized a bond-order potential for 1H-MoS2 [23], which is based on the bond order concept underlying the Brenner potential [6].
A separate force field model was parameterized in 2010 for MD simulations of bulk 2H-MoS2 [24].
The present author (J.W.J.) and his collaborators parameterized the SW potential for 1H-MoS2 in 2013 [13], which was improved by one of the present authors (J.W.J.) in 2015 [7].
Recently, another set of parameters for the SW potential were proposed for the single-layer 1H-MoS2 [25].
We show the VFF model and the SW potential for single-layer 1H-MoS2 in this section.
These potentials have been developed in previous works.
The VFF model presented here is from Ref.
[22], while the SW potential presented in this section is from Ref. [7].
The structural parameters for the single-layer 1H-MoS2 are from the first-principles calcula- tions as shown in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = S) [26].
The Mo atom layer in the single-layer 1H-MoS2 is sandwiched by two S atom layers.
Accordingly, each Mo atom is surrounded by six S atoms, while each S atom is connected to three Mo atoms.
The bond length between neighboring Mo and S atoms is d ¼ 2:382 Å, and the angles are θMoSS ¼ 80:581 and θSMoMo ¼ 80:581. The VFF model for single-layer 1H-MoS2 is from Ref.
[22], which is able to describe the phonon spectrum and the sound velocity accurately.
We have listed the first three leading force con- stants for single-layer 1H-MoS2 in Table 110, neglecting other weak interaction terms.
The SW potential parameters for single-layer 1H-MoS2 used by GULP are listed in Tables 111 and 112.

1H-MoSe2 There is a recent parameter set for the SW potential in the single-layer 1H-MoSe2 [25].
In this section, we will develop both VFF model and the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-MoSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-MoSe2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = Se).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.

The resultant angles are θMoSeSe ¼ θSeMoMo ¼ 82:119 and θMoSeSe0 ¼ 81:343, in which atoms Se and Se0 are from differ- ent (top or bottom) groups.
Table 114 shows four VFF terms for the 1H-MoSe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 55(a).

The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H- MoSe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 103.0 and 101.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
These values are in considerable agreement with the experimental results, e.g., 103.9 N/m from Ref.
[18], or 113.9 N/m from Ref. [35].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:24, which agrees quite well with the ab initio value of 0.23 [18].
We have determined the nonlinear parameter to be B ¼ 0:46d4 in Eq. (5) by fitting to the third- order nonlinear elastic constant D from the ab initio calculations [35].
We have extracted the value of D ¼  383:7 N/m by fitting the stress-strain relation along the armchair direction in the ab initio calculations to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 365.4 and 402.4 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 13.6 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 13.0 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 30.
1H-MoTe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-MoTe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop both VFF model and the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-MoTe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-MoTe2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = Te).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six Te atoms.
These Te atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Te atom is connected to three Mo atoms.
The structural parameters are from Ref.
[36], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:55Å and the bond length dMoTe ¼ 2:73Å.
The resultant angles are θMoTeTe ¼ θTeMoMo ¼ 81:111 and θMoTeTe0 ¼ 82:686, in which atoms Te and Te0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 118 shows four VFF terms for the 1H-MoTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 57(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [36].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [12, 34, 37].
Figure 57(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 119.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 120.

We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-MoTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Figure 1 (with M = Mo and X = Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = Mo and X = Te) shows that, for 1H-MoTe2, we can differentiate these angles around the Mo atom by assigning these six neighboring Te atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 Mo atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H-MoTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 58 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-MoTe2 of dimension 100  100Å.

The single-layer 1H-MoTe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.

1H-TaS2 In 1983, the VFF model was developed to investigate the lattice dynamical properties in the bulk 2H-TaS2 [21].
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H- TaS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-TaS2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = Ta and X = S).
Each Ta atom is surrounded by six S atoms.
These S atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each S atom is connected to three Ta atoms.
The structural parameters are from Ref.

The interlayer coupling will strengthen the out-of-plane acoustic (flexural) branch, so the flexural branch from the present VFF model (blue line) is lower than the theoretical results for bulk 2H-TaS2 (gray pentagons).

1H-WO2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-WO2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-WO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-WO2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = W and X = O).
Each W atom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each O atom is connected to three W atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], including the lattice constant a ¼ 2:80Å and the bond length dWO ¼ 2:03Å.
The resultant angles are θWOO ¼ θOWW ¼ 87:206 and θWOO0 ¼ 74:435, in which atoms O and O0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 130 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-WO2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 63(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [12].
Figure 63(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 131.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 132.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 133.
We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-WO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom W in Figure 1 (with M = W and X = O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of LAMMPS [13, 14].
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS pack- age.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = W and X = O) shows that, for 1H-WO2, we can differentiate these angles around the W atom by assigning these six VFF type Bond stretching Angle bending Expression 1 2 KWOðΔrÞ2 1 2 KWOOðΔθÞ2 1 2 KWOO0ðΔθÞ2 1 2 KOWWðΔθÞ2 Parameter 15.318 10.276 10.276 10.276 r0 or θ0 2.030 87.206 74.435 87.206 The second line gives an explicit expression for each VFF term.

Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer 1H-WO2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-WO2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 237.1 and 237.2 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-WO2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 1218.0 and 1312.9 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.

1H-WS2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-WS2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop both VFF model and the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-WS2.
Table 134 shows the VFF terms for the 1H-WS2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 65(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [31].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [12, 26, 34, 38, 39].
Figure 65(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

These values are in reasonably agreement with the ab initio results, e.g., 116 N/m from [18], or 126.2 N/m from [35].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:20, which agrees with the ab initio value of 0.19 [18].
We have determined the nonlinear parameter to be B ¼ 0:41d4 in Eq. (5) by fitting to the third- order nonlinear elastic constant D from the ab initio calculations [17].
We have extracted the value of D ¼  413:1 N/m by fitting the stress-strain relation along the armchair direction in the ab initio calculations to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 400.4 and 444.3 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 17:8 N=m at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 17:1 N=m at the ultimate strain of 0.29 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 36.
1H-WTe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-WTe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop both VFF model and the SW potential for the single-layer 1H-WTe2.
The bulk WTe2 has the trigonally coordinated H phase structure [43].
However, it has been predicted that the structure of the single-layer WTe2 can be either the trigonally coordinated H phase [12] or the octahedrally coordinated Td phase [44–47], with Td phase as the more stable structure [42].
We will thus consider both phases in the present paper.
This section is devoted to the H phase for the WTe2 (1H-WTe2), while the SW potential for the Td-WTe2 (1T-WTe2) is presented in another section.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-WTe2 is shown in Figure 1 (with M = W and X = Te).
Each W atom is surrounded by six Te atoms.
These Te atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Te atom is connected to three W atoms.
The structural parameters are from [42], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:55 Å and the bond length dWTe ¼ 2:73 Å.
The resultant angles are θWTeTe ¼ θTeWW ¼ 81:111 and θWTeTe0 ¼ 82:686, in which atoms Te and Te0 are from different (top or bottom) groups.
Table 142 shows the VFF terms for the 1H-WTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interac- tion shown by Eq. (1), while the other terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 69(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [42].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [12].
Figure 69(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
Handbook of Stillinger-Weber Potential Parameters for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals 108The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 143.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 144.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 145.
We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-WTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom W in Figure 1 (with M = W and X = Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We have suggested two options to differentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source file of VFF type Bond stretching Angle bending Expression 1 2 KWTeðΔrÞ2 1 2 KWTeTeðΔθÞ2 1 2 KWTeTe0ðΔθÞ2 1 2 KTeWWðΔθÞ2 Parameter 5.483 7.016 7.016 5.718 r0 or θ0 2.730 81.111 82.686 81.111 The second line gives an explicit expression for each VFF term.

According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we differentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Figure 2 (with M = W and X = Te) shows that, for 1H-WTe2, we can differentiate these angles around the W atom by assigning these six neighboring Te atoms with different atom types.
It can be found that 12 atom types are necessary for the purpose of differentiating all 6 neighbors around 1 W atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1H-WTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 70 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-WTe2 of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer 1H-WTe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-WTe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 82.7 and 81.9 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
These values are in reasonably agreement with the ab initio results, e.g., 86.4 N/m from [18] or 93.9 N/m from [35].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:20, which agrees with the ab initio value of 0.18 [18].

The resultant angles are θScOO ¼ 102:115 with O atoms from the same (top or bottom) group and θOScSc ¼ 102:115.

Each Se atom is connected to three Sc atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], includ- ing the lattice constant a ¼ 3:52 Å and the bond length dScSe ¼ 2:64 Å.
The resultant angle is θSeScSc ¼ 83:621 and θScSeSe ¼ 83:621 with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table 154 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-ScSe2, one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KScSeSe is for the angle θScSeSe with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 76(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
We note that the lowest-frequency branch around the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab initio results.
This branch is the flexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.
However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the flexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the first-principles package [20], so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch.

Table 202 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-CoTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KCoTeTe is for the angle θCoTeTe with both Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
We find that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by fitting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 59 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.14 [48].

The single-layer 1T-ZrTe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-ZrTe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 39.2 and 39.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:10.
The fitted Young’s modulus value is about 10% smaller than the ab initio result of 44 N/m [48], as only short-range interactions are considered in the present work.
The long- range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about 10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ZrTe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.

1T-NbS2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-NbS2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-NbS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-NbS2 is shown in Figure 71 (with M=Nb and X=S).
Each Nb atom is surrounded by six S atoms.
These S atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each S atom is connected to three Nb atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [12], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:30 Å and the bond length dNbS ¼ 2:45 Å.
The resultant angles are θNbSS ¼ 84:671 with S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group and θSNbNb ¼ 84:671. Table 234 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-NbS2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KNbSS is for the angle θNbSS with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.

The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [12].
The lowest acoustic branch (flexural mode) is linear and very close to the in- plane transverse acoustic branch in the ab initio calculations, which may be due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance [20].
Figure 116(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

1T-MoSe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-MoSe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-MoSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-MoSe2 is shown in Figure 71 (with M=Mo and X=Se).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Se atom is connected to three Mo atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [48], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:2685 Å and the bond length dMoSe ¼ 2:5293 Å, which are derived from the angle θSeMoMo ¼ 80:5.
The other angle is θMoSeSe ¼ 80:5 with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table 250 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-MoSe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KMoSeSe is for the angle θMoSeSe with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
We find that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by fitting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 104 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.13 [48].
The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-MoSe2, which was attrib- uted to the orbital coupling in this material.
The orbital coupling enhances the angle bending interaction in the VFF model.
As a result, the value of the angle bending parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio [52].
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 251.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 252.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 253.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1T-MoSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 124 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-MoSe2 of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.

The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-MoSe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 88.2 and 87.9 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼  0:13.
The fitted Young’s modulus value is about 10% smaller than the ab initio result of 104 N/m [48], as only short-range interactions are considered in the present work.

1T-TcTe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-TcTe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-TcTe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-TcTe2 is shown in Figure 71 (with M=Tc and X=Te).
Each Tc atom is surrounded by six Te atoms.
These Te atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each Te atom is connected to three Tc atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [48], includ- ing the lattice constant a ¼ 3:4149 Å and the bond length dTcTe ¼ 2:6900 Å, which are derived from the angle θTeTcTc ¼ 78:8.
The other angle is θTcTeTe ¼ 78:8 with Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table 266 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-TcTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending 0  100  200  300  400 Γ M K ω(k) (cm−1) Γ VFF SW Figure 131.

We note that the angle bending term KTcTeTe is for the angle θTcTeTe with both Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
We find that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by fitting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 34 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.36 [48].
The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-TcTe2, which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material.
The orbital coupling enhances the angle bending interac- tion in the VFF model.
As a result, the value of the angle bending parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio [52].
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 267.

The ultimate stress is about 1.9 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.11 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 2.0 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.14 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate strain decreases to be about 0.01 at 300 K, so the single-layer 1T-TcTe2 is not very stable at higher temperature.
It is because this material is very soft and the Poisson’s ratio is very small (negative value).

In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-HfS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-HfS2 is shown in Figure 71 (with M=Hf and X=S).
Each Hf atom is surrounded by six S atoms.
These S atoms are categorized into the top group (e.g., atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (e.g., atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each S atom is connected to three Hf atoms.
The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [53], including the lattice constant a ¼ 3:64 Å and the bond length dHfS ¼ 2:55 Å.
The resultant angles are θHfSS ¼ 91:078 with S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group and θSHfHf ¼ 91:078. Table 294 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-HfS2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KHfSS is for the angle θHfSS with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
These force constant param- eters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 146(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [38].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [34, 35].
Figure 146(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 295.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 296.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 297.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1T-HfS2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 147 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-HfS2 of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer 1T-HfS2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-HfS2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].

The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
These values are close to the ab initio results at 0 K temperature, e.g., 79.86 N/m in Ref. [53].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:16, which agrees reasonably with the ab initio result [54] of 0.19.

1T-TaSe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-TaSe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-TaSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-TaSe2 is shown in Figure 71 (with M=Ta and X=Se).

The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [48], includ- ing the lattice constant a ¼ 3:4602 Å and the bond length dTaSe ¼ 2:5609 Å, which are derived from the angle θSeTaTa ¼ 85.
The other angle is θTaSeSe ¼ 85 with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table 310 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-TaSe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KTaSeSe is for the angle θTaSeSe with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.

Table 326 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-WTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KWTeTe is for the angle θWTeTe with both Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
We find that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by fitting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 88 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.18 [48].

As a result, the value of the angle bending parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio [52].

1T-IrTe2 Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-IrTe2 are based on the first-principles calculations.
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer 1T-IrTe2.

The structural parameters are from the first-principles calculations [48], includ- ing the lattice constant a ¼ 3:8431 Å and the bond length dIrTe ¼ 2:6490 Å, which are derived from the angle θTeIrIr ¼ 93.
The other angle is θIrTeTe ¼ 93 with Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table 342 shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-IrTe2; one of which is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
We note that the angle bending term KIrTeTe is for the angle θIrTeTe with both Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
We find that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by fitting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 45 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.22 [48].

Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 251We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer 1T-PtTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 177 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-PtTe2 of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer 1T-PtTe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-PtTe2.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 89.1 and 88.7 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:19.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-PtTe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 306.8 and 340.9 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 12.1 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 11.6 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 90.
Black phosphorus The black phosphorus is also named the α phosphorus.
There are several empirical potentials available for the atomic interaction in the black phosphorus.
A VFF model was proposed for the single-layer black phosphorus in 1982 [56].

However, the mechanical properties from this SW potential are smaller than first-principles calculations, as some angle- angle crossing VFF terms cannot be implemented in the SW potential.
We will thus propose a new set of SW potential for the single-layer black phosphorus in this section.
The structure of the single-layer black phosphorus is shown in Figure 178, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [57].
The black phosphorus has a puckered configu- ration as shown in Figure 178(b), where the pucker is perpendicular to the x-direction.
The bases for the rectangular unit cell are a1 ¼ 4:422 Å and a2 ¼ 3:348 Å. For bulk black phospho- rus, the basis lattice vector in the third direction is a3 ¼ 10:587 Å. There are four phosphorus atoms in the basic unit cell, and their relative coordinates are ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;vÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  vÞ with u ¼ 0:0821 and v ¼ 0:1011.
Atoms are categorized into the top and bottom groups.
Atoms in the top group are denoted by P1, while atoms in the bottom group are denoted by P2.
Table 358 shows four VFF terms for the single-layer black phosphorus; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are reasonably chosen to be the same for the two bond stretching terms denoted by r12 and r14, as these two bonds have very Figure 178.

The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ123 and θ134, which have very similar chemical environment.
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 179(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [55].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [58–64].

Figure 180 shows the stress-strain relations for the black phosphorus of size 100  100 Å.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 24.3 and 90.5 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
These values agree quite well with previously reported ab initio results, e.g., 28.9 and 101.6 N/m from [65] or 24.4 and 92.1 N/m from [66] or 24.3 and 80.2 N/m from [58].
The ultimate stress is about 4.27 N/m at the critical strain of 0.33 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 8 N/m at the critical strain of 0.19 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. These values agree quite well with the ab initio results at 0 K [66].
It should be noted that the Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ 0:058 and νyx ¼ 0:22.

The Poisson’s ratio cannot be obtained correctly by the VFF model proposed in 1982 [56] and the SW potential [7] either [68].
These failures are due to the missing of one angle-angle crossing term [69], which has not been implemented in the package LAMMPS and is not included in the present work. 91.
p-Arsenene Present studies on the puckered (p-) arsenene, also named α arsenene, are based on first- principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-arsenene.
We will thus parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer p-arsenene in this section.
We will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the single-layer p-arsenene.
The structure of the single-layer p-arsenene is exactly the same as that of the black phosphorus as shown in Figure 178.
Structural parameters for p-arsenene are from the ab initio calcula- tions [70].
The pucker of the p-arsenene is perpendicular to the x (armchair)-direction.
The bases for the rectangular unit cell are a1 ¼ 4:77 Å and a2 ¼ 3:68 Å.
There are four As atoms in the basic unit cell, and their relative coordinates are ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; ;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;vÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  vÞ with u ¼ 0:0714 and v ¼ 0:108.
The value of the dimensionless parameter u is extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in [70].
The other dimensionless parame- ter v is a ratio based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, so the other basis a3 ¼ 11:11 Å from [71] is also adopted in extracting the value of v.
We note that the main purpose of the usage of u and v in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in [70].

We note that the lowest frequency branch around the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab initio results.
This branch is the flexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.
However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the flexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the first-principles package [20] so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch.
Figure 181(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

p-Antimonene Present studies on the puckered (p-) antimonene, also named α antimonene, are based on first- principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-antimonene.
We will thus parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer p-antimonene in this sec- tion.
We will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the single-layer p-antimonene.
The structure of the single-layer p-antimonene is shown in Figure 183, which is similar as that of the black phosphorus as shown in Figure 178.
Structural parameters for p-antimonene are from the ab initio calculations [70].
The pucker of the p-antimonene is perpendicular to the x (armchair)-direction.
The bases for the rectangular unit cell are a1 ¼ 4:73 Å and a2 ¼ 4:36 Å.
There are four Sb atoms in the basic unit cell, and their relative coordinates are ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;v þ wÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  v þ wÞ with u ¼ 0:044, v ¼ 0:128, and w ¼ 0:0338.
The value of the dimensionless parameter u is extracted from the geometrical parameters (bond lengths and bond angles) provided in [70].
The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, so an arbitrary value of a3 ¼ 11:11 Å is adopted in extracting the values of v and w.
The value of a3 has no effect on the actual position of each Sb atom.
We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention of black phos- phorus.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in [70].

Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 259As shown in Figure 183(b), a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p- antimonene is that Sb atoms in the top/bottom group are further divided into two subgroups with different z-coordinates.
Specifically, in Figure 183(c), there is a difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
As a result of the nonzero value of w, there are two different intergroup angles, i.e., θ134¼ 88:3 ∘and θ415¼ 102:8 ∘.
We have w ¼ 0 for the ideal puckered configuration of the black phosphorus.
Table 366 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-antimonene; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are reasonably chosen to be the same for the two bond stretching terms denoted by r12 and r14, as these two bonds have very close bond length value.
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.
As a result, there are only three force constant parameters, i.e., K12 ¼ K14, K123, and K134 ¼ K415.
These three force constant parame- ters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 185(a).

We note that the lowest frequency branch around the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab initio results.
This branch is the flexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.
However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the flexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the first-principles package [20], so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch.

p-Bismuthene Present studies on the puckered (p-) bismuthene, which is also named α bismuthene, are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-bismuthene.
We will thus parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer p-bismuthene in this section.
We will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the single- layer p-bismuthene.
The structure of the single-layer p-bismuthene is the same as p-antimonene as shown in Figure 183.
Structural parameters for p-bismuthene are from the ab initio calculations [77].
The pucker of the p-bismuthene is perpendicular to the x (armchair)-direction.
The bases for the rectangular unit cell are a1 ¼ 4:94 Å and a2 ¼ 4:55 Å. There are four Bi atoms in the basic unit cell, and their relative coordinates are ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;v þ wÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  v þ wÞ with u ¼ 0:0405, v ¼ 0:130, and w ¼ 0:0391.
The value of the dimension- less parameter u is extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in [77].
The dimen- sionless parameters v and w are ratios based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z- direction, so an arbitrary value of a3 ¼ 11:81 Å is adopted in extracting the values of v and w.
The value of a3 has no effect on the actual position of each Bi atom.
We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention of black phosphorus.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in [77].
As shown in Figure 183(b), a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-bismuthene is that Bi atoms in the top/bottom group are further divided into two subgroups with different z-coordinates.
Specifically, in Figure 183(c), there is a difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
As a result of the nonzero value of w, there are two different intergroup angles, i.e., θ134 ¼ 86:486 and θ415 ¼ 103:491.
We have w ¼ 0 for the ideal puckered configuration of the black phosphorus.
Table 370 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-bismuthene; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are reasonably chosen to be the same for the two bond stretching terms denoted by r12 and r14, as these two bonds have very close bond length value.
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.
As a result, there are only three force constant parameters, i.e., K12 ¼ K14, K123, and K134 ¼ K415.
These three force constant parame- ters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 187(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [77].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [64].
Figure 187(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 10.2 and 26.2 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ 0:24 and νyx ¼ 0:61.
These values are very close to the ab initio calculations, e.g., νxy ¼ 0:261 and νyx ¼ 0:648 in [77].
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress-strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 12.4 and 86.4 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.6 N/m at the critical strain of 0.38 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

p-SiO Present studies on the puckered (p-) SiO are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-SiO.
We will thus parametrize the SW poten- tial for the single-layer p-SiO in this section.
The structure of the single-layer p-SiO is shown in Figure 189, with M = Si and X = O. Structural parameters for p-SiO are from the ab initio calculations [78].
There are four atoms in the unit cell with relative coordinates as ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;v þ wÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  v þ wÞ with u ¼ 0:1501, v ¼ 0:0605, and w ¼ 0:0800.
The value of these dimen- sionless parameters are extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in [78], including lattice constants a1 ¼ 4:701 Å and a2 ¼ 2:739 Å, bond lengths d12 ¼ 1:843 Å and d14 ¼ 2:859 Å, and the angle θ145¼ 96:0 ∘.
The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which are arbitrarily chosen as a3 ¼ 10:0 Å. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present work.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in [78].
As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-SiO is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the out-most positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the out-most atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the out-most positions for w < 0.
The p-SiO has a zigzag configuration as shown in Figure 191, which is a specific case of the puckered structure shown in Figure 189.

The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameterization [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.

Figure 195 shows the stress-strain relations for the single-layer p-GeO of size 100  100 Å.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The structure of p-GeO is so soft along the armchair direction that the Young’s modulus is almost zero in the armchair direction.
The Young’s modulus is 14.5 and 78.9 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ 0:09 and νyx ¼ 0:65.
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress- strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 22.0 and 383.3 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.

P-SnO Present studies on the puckered (p-) SnO are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-SnO.
We will thus parametrize the SW poten- tial for the single-layer p-SnO in this section.
The structure of the single-layer p-SnO is shown in Figure 189, with M = Sn and X = O. Structural parameters for p-SnO are from the ab initio calculations [78].
There are four atoms in the unit cell with relative coordinates such as ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;v þ wÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  v þ wÞ with u ¼ 0:1485, v ¼ 0:0818, and w ¼ 0:0836.
The values of these dimen- sionless parameters are extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in Ref.
[78], including lattice constants a1 ¼ 4:764 Å and a2 ¼ 3:400 Å, bond lengths d12 ¼ 2:127 Å and d14 ¼ 2:163 Å, and the angle θ145 ¼ 90:0.
The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which is arbitrarily chosen as a3 ¼ 10:0 Å. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present work.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. [78].
As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-SnO is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost 0 2 4 6 8  0  0.1 0.2  0.3 Stress (N/m) Strain arm 1K arm 300K zig 1K zig 300K Figure 195.

(9) and (10) Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 281As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-SiS is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost positions for w < 0.
Table 390 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-SiS; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown in Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown in Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.
All force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 200(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameterization [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.
Figure 200(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 391.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 392.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 393.
Figure 201 shows the stress-strain relations for the single-layer p-SiS of size 100  100 Å.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 10.9 and 34.8 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ 0:04 and νyx ¼ 0:12.
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress-strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 24.1 and 145.2 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.3 N/m at the critical strain of 0.39 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 4.2 N/m at the critical strain of 0.25 in the zigzag direction at the low tempera- ture of 1 K.

Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost positions for w < 0.
Table 402 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-CSe; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown in Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown in Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.
All force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 206(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameterization [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.
Figure 206(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 403.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 404.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 405.
Eight atom types have been introduced for writing the SW potential script used by LAMMPS as shown in Figure 190 with M = C and X = Se, which helps to increase the cutoff for the bond stretching interaction between atom 1 and atom 2 in Figure 189(c).

The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 17.2 and 75.4 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].

As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-SnSe is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost positions for w < 0.
Table 414 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-SnSe; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown in Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown in Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.

As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-GeTe is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost positions for w < 0.
Table 426 shows five VFF terms for the single-layer p-GeTe; two of which are the bond stretching interactions shown in Eq. (1), while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths.
All force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 218(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew et al. parameterization [80], and the double-ζ Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 309orbital basis set is adopted.

The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 8.1 and 41.6 N/m in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].

P-SnTe Present studies on the puckered (p-) SnTe are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-SnTe.
We will thus parametrize the SW potential for the single-layer p-SnTe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer p-SnTe is shown in Figure 189, with M = Sn and X = Te.
Structural parameters for p-SnTe are from the ab initio calculations [78].
There are four atoms in the unit cell with relative coordinates such as ðu; 0;  vÞ, ðu; 0;vÞ, ð0:5  u; 0:5;v þ wÞ, and ð0:5 þ u; 0:5;  v þ wÞ with u ¼ 0:0478, v ¼ 0:1567, and w ¼  0:0050.
The values of these dimensionless parameters are extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in Ref.
[78], including lattice constants a1 ¼ 4:581 Å and a2 ¼ 4:542 Å, bond lengths d12 ¼ 2:931 Å and d14 ¼ 3:164 Å, and the angle θ145 ¼ 96:0.
The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which is arbitrarily chosen as a3 ¼ 10:0 Å. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present work.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. [78].
As shown in Figure 189, a specific feature in the puckered configuration of the p-SnTe is that there is a small difference of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3.
Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the outmost positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5, and 6 are the outmost atoms if w > 0 in Figure 189(c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the outmost positions for w < 0.

Silicene There have been several empirical potentials available for the silicene.
A many-body potential based on the Lennard-Jones and Axilrod-Teller functions was used to describe the interaction within the single-layer silicene [85].
The modified embedded-atom potential [86] was used by Pei et al. to simulate the thermal transport in the single-layer silicene in 2013 [87].
The environment-dependent interatomic potential [88] was also used to simulate the silicene [89].
In particular, the original set of SW parameters [4] for the silicon was found to be not suitable for the planar silicene, so two sets of optimized parameters for the SW potential were proposed to simulate the thermal conductivity in the single-layer silicene in 2014 [90].
We will develop a new SW potential to describe the interaction within the silicene in this section, with specific focus on the mechanical properties of the silicene.
The structure of the silicene is shown in Figure 222, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [84].
The silicene has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 222(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
The height of the buckle is h ¼ 0:45 Å and the lattice constant is 3.87 Å, which results in a bond length of 2.279 Å. Table 434 shows the VFF model for the silicene.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 223(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [84].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [84, 91–102].
Figure 223(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

Parameterization of Stillinger-Weber Potential for Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystals http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71929 315We note that the present SW potential is fitted perfectly to the three acoustic phonon branches, so it can give a nice description for the elastic deformation of the silicene.
As a trade off, the optical phonons are overestimated by the present SW potential.
Hence, the present SW poten- tial is in particular suitable for the simulation of mechanical or thermal processes, which are dominated by acoustic phonons, while the present SW potential may cause a systematic error for the optical absorption process, which mainly involves the optical phonons.
One can intro- duce the long-range interactions (e.g., the second-nearest-neighboring interaction) to give a good description for both acoustic and optical phonon branches, see one such example for borophene in Ref. [14].
It is because the long-range interaction mainly contributes to the acoustic phonon branches, while it makes only neglectable contribution to the optical phonon branches.

The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 63.3 Nm1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is isotropic for the silicene.
The value of the Young’s modulus agrees with the value of 63.8 Nm1 from the ab initio calcula- tions [103].
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:15, which are smaller but comparable with the ab initio results of 0.325 [103].
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress-strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 212.5 and 267.5 Nm1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 8.6 Nm1 at the critical strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 7.8 Nm1 at the critical strain of 0.23 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The stress-strain curves shown in Figure 224 disclose a structural transition at the strain around 0.076 for the silicene at the low temperature of 1 K. The buckled configuration of the silicene is flattened during this structural transition, which can be seen from these two insets in Figure 224.
This structural transition was also observed in the ab initio calculations [95], where the critical strain for the structural transition is 0.2.
At temperatures above 300 K, this struc- tural transition is blurred by stronger thermal vibrations; i.e., the buckled configuration of the silicene can be strongly disturbed by the thermal vibration at higher temperatures.

Germanene In a recent work, the Tersoff potential was applied to simulate the thermal conductivity of the germanene nanoribbon [104].
We will provide the SW potential to describe the interaction within the germanene in this section.
The structure of the germanene is shown in Figure 222, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [84].
The germanene has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 222(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
The height of the buckle is h ¼ 0:69 Å and the lattice constant is 4.06 Å, which results in a bond length of 2.443 Å. Table 438 shows the VFF model for the germanene.
The force constant parameters are deter- mined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 225(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [84].
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [84, 92, 93, 98, 101, 102, 105].
Figure 225(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 439.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 440.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 441.
Figure 226 shows the stress-strain relations for the germanene of size 100  100 Å.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 53.2 Nm1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is isotropic for the germanene.
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:19.
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress-strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 229.2 and 278.2 Nm1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 7.5 Nm1 at the critical strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

Stanene There are several available empirical potentials for the description of the interaction within the stanene.
The modified embedded atom method potential was applied to simulate mechanical properties for the stanene [106].
A VFF model was fitted for the stanene in 2015 [107].
The Tersoff potential was parameterized to describe the interaction for stanene [108].
In this sec- tion, we will develop the SW potential for the stanene.
The structure of the stanene is shown in Figure 222, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [105].
The stanene has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 222(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
The height of the buckle is h ¼ 0:86 Å and the lattice constant is 4.68 Å, which results in a bond length of 2.836 Å. Table 442 shows the VFF model for the stanene.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 227(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref.
[105] with the spin-orbit coupling effect.
Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [101, 102, 105, 109–111].
Figure 227(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 443.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 444.

The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 17.0 Nm1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is isotropic for the stanene.
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:29.
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by fitting the stress-strain relation to σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D are 37.2 Nm1 and 69.4 Nm1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 3.5 Nm1 at the critical strain of 0.32 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

Indiene In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the indiene, i.e., the single layer of indium atoms.
The structure of the indiene is shown in Figure 222, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [112].
The indiene has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 222(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
The lattice constant is 4.24 Å and the bond length is 2.89 Å, which results in the buckling height of h ¼ 1:536 Å. Table 446 shows the VFF model for the indiene.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 229(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [112].
We note that the lowest frequency branch around the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab initio results.
This branch is the flexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.
However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the flexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the first-principles package [20], so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch.
Figure 229(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 447.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 448.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 449.
Figure 230 shows the stress-strain relations for the indiene of size 100  100 Å.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K. The Young’s modulus is 8.4 Nm1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus of the indiene is very small; i.e., the indiene is very soft.
As a result, we find that the structure becomes unstable at room temper- ature.
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:18.

b-Antimonene The buckled (b-) antimonene is a Sb allotrope, which is also named β antimonene.
Present studies on the b-antimonene are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical poten- tial has been proposed for the b-antimonene.
We will, thus, parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer b-antimonene in this section.

We will parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer b-bismuthene in this section.

Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations [77].
We note that the lowest-frequency branch around the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab initio results.
This branch is the flexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.
However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the flexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the first-principles package [20], so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch.
Figure 237(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

The Young’s modulus is isotropic for the b-bismuthene.
The value of the Young’s modulus is close to the value of 23.9 N/m from the ab initio calculations [77].
The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:25, which are comparable with the ab initio results of 0.327 [77].

b-CO Present studies on the buckled (b-) CO are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the b-CO.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer b-CO in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-CO is shown in Figure 239.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [78].
The b-CO has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 239(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
This structure can be determined by two independent geometrical parameters, including the lattice constant 2.454 Å and the bond length 1.636 Å. Table 466 shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-CO.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 240(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameteriza- tion [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.
Figure 240(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

The Young’s modulus is 99.1 and 98.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag direc- tions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:08.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-CO.

b-SiTe Present studies on the buckled (b-) SiTe are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the b-SiTe.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer b-SiTe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-SiTe is shown in Figure 239.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [83].
The b-SiTe has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 239(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
This structure can be determined by two independent geometrical parameters, e.g., the lattice constant 3.83 Å and the bond length 2.689 Å. The resultant height of the buckle is h ¼ 1:53 Å. Table 494 shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-SiTe.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 254(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [83].
Figure 254(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 495.

Figure 255 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer b-SiTe of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer b-SiTe is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-SiTe.
The Young’s mod- ulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 34.3 and 34.6 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag direc- tions.
These values agree with the ab initio result at 0 K temperature, e.g., 34.1 N/m in [83].
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:18, which agrees with the ab initio result [83] of 0.18.

B-GeTe Present studies on the buckled (b-) GeTe are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the b-GeTe.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer b-GeTe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-GeTe is shown in Figure 239.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [78].
The b-GeTe has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 239(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
This structure can be determined by two independent geometrical parameters, including the lattice constant 3.939 Å and the bond length 2.768 Å. Table 510 shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-GeTe.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 262(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradient approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameteriza- tion [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.
Figure 262(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 270(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated from the SIESTA package [79].
The generalized gradient approximation is applied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameteriza- tion [80], and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted.
Figure 270(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 527.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 528.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 529.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer b-SnTe under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 271 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer b-SnTe of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer b-SnTe is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-SnTe.
The Young’s mod- ulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 19.6 and 19.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag direc- tions.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:23.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-SnTe.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.

b-AlSb Present studies on the buckled AlSb (b-AlSb) are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the b-AlSb.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer b-AlSb in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-AlSb is shown in Figure 239.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [114].
The b-AlSb has a buckled configuration as shown in Figure 239(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
This structure can be determined by two independent geometrical parameters, e.g., the lattice constant 4.33 Å and the bond length 2.57 Å.
The resultant height of the buckle is h ¼ 0:60 Å. Table 562 shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-AlSb.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 288(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [114].
Figure 288(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 563.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 564.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 565.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer b-AlSb under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 289 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer b-AlSb of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer b-AlSb is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-AlSb.
The Young’s mod- ulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 41.7 and 42.0 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-AlSb.

InS Present studies on the InS are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the InS.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single- layer InS in this section.
The structure of the single-layer InS is shown in Figure 290 with M = In and X = S.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [115].
InS has a bi-buckled configura- tion as shown in Figure 290(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
Two buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior IndIn bonds, forming a bi-buckled configuration.
This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical parameters, e.g., the lattice constant 3.94 Å, the bond length dInS ¼ 2:56 Å, and the bond length dInIn ¼ 2:82 Å. Table 594 shows the VFF model for the single-layer InS.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 305(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. [115].
Figure 305(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 595.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 596.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 597.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer InS under uniaxial tension at 1 and 300 K. Figure 306 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer InS of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer InS is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer InS.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 52.9 and 53.2 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:29.

InSe Present studies on the InSe are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical poten- tial has been proposed for the InSe.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer InSe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer InSe is shown in Figure 290 with M=In and X=Se.
The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [115].
The InSe has a bi-buckled configuration as shown in Figure 290(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
Two buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior In-In bonds, forming a bi- buckled configuration.
This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical parameters, e.g., the lattice constant 4.10 Å, the bond length dInSe ¼ 2:69 Å, and the bond length dInIn ¼ 2:81 Å. Table 610 shows the VFF model for the single-layer InSe.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 313(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [115].

The Young’s modu- lus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 55.2 and 55.3 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy ¼ νyx ¼ 0:23.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer GaTe.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B ¼ 0:5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most materials.
The value of the third-order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by fitting the stress-strain relation to the function σ ¼ EE þ 1 2 DE2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are 183.2 and 195.6 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 7.8 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 7.8 N/m at the ultimate strain of 0.37 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K. 157.
InTe Present studies on the InTe are based on first-principles calculations, and no empirical poten- tial has been proposed for the InTe.
We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for the single-layer InTe in this section.

The structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations [115].
The InTe has a bi-buckled configuration as shown in Figure 290(b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction.
Two buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior In-In bonds, forming a bi- buckled configuration.
This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical parameters, e.g., the lattice constant 4.40 Å, the bond length dInTe ¼ 2:89 Å, and the bond length dInIn ¼ 2:81 Å. Table 626 shows the VFF model for the single-layer InTe.
The force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Figure 321(a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from [115].
Figure 321(b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 627.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Table 628.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Table 629.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-layer InTe under uniaxial tension at 1.0 and 300.0 K. Figure 322 shows the stress-strain curve for the tension of a single-layer InTe of dimension 100  100 Å. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer InTe is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer InTe.
The Young’s modu- lus can be obtained by a linear fitting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 40.6 and 40.9 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.

Borophene Most existing theoretical studies on the monolayer of boron atoms (borophene) are based on the first-principles calculations.
The ReaxFF force field model was developed for the borophene recently [117].
The present authors have provided the VFF model and the SW potential to describe the atomic interaction within the borophene [14], which includes the second-nearest-neighboring interactions.
In the present work, we present a more efficient SW potential with only the first-nearest-neighboring interactions.
The structure of the borophene is shown in Figure 323, with structural parameters from the ab initio calculations [116].
Borophene has a puckered configuration as shown in Figure 323(b), where the pucker is perpendicular to the x-direction.
The height of the pucker is h ¼ 0:911 Å, which is the distance between the top chain and the bottom chain along the out-of-plane z- direction.
The two lattice bases are a1 ¼ 2:866 Å and a2 ¼ 1:614 Å for the in-plane rectangular unit cell.
There are two inequivalent boron atoms in the unit cell.
Boron atoms are categorized into the top chain and the bottom chain.
The top chain includes atoms like 1, 4, and 7.
The bottom chain includes atoms like 2, 3, 5, and 6.
Table 630 shows four VFF terms for the borophene; two of which are the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1), while the other two terms are the angle bending interaction shown by Eq. (2).
These force constant parameters are determined by fitting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Figure 324(a).

We note that 12 atom types have been introduced for the simulation of borophene using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom 1 in Figure 323(a) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS.
We thus need to differentiate these angles by assigning these six neighboring atoms (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with different atom types.

Figure 326 shows the stress-strain relations for the borophene of size 100  100 Å.
The struc- ture is uniaxially stretched in the x or y directions at 1 and 300 K. The Young’s modulus is 162.7 and 385.0 N/m in the x and y directions, respectively, at 1 K, which is obtained by linear fitting of the stress-strain relations in [0, 0.01].
These values are in good agreement with the ab initio results at 0 K temperature, e.g., 170 and 398 N/m in [119], or 166 and 389 N/m in [116], or 163 and 399 N/m in [120].
Previous ab initio calculations obtained negative Poisson’s ratio for the uniaxial stretching of the borophene in the x and y directions, e.g., 0.02 and 0.04 in Refs 119 and 116.
The Poisson’s ratio from the present SW potential is 0.03 and 0.07 along the x and y directions, respectively, which is quite comparable with the ab initio results.

The obtained values of D are 1100.1 and 2173.6 N/m in the x and y directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 12.3 N/m at the critical strain of 0.17 in the x-direction at the low temperature of 1 K, which agree quite well with the ab initio results at 0 K [116, 118, 120].
The ultimate stress is about 32.9 N/m at the critical strain of 0.16 in the y-direction at the low temperature of 1 K, which are quite comparable with ab initio results at 0 K [116, 118, 120]. 159.
Conclusion remarks As a final remark, we note some major advantages and deficiencies for the SW potential parameters provided in the present work.
On the one hand, the key feature of the SW potential is its high efficiency, which is maintained by using minimum potential parameters in the present work, so the interaction range is limited to the first-nearest-neighboring atoms.
As a result, the present SW potential parameters are of high computational efficiency.
On the other hand, since the interaction is limited to short-range, the optical branches in the phonon spectrum are typically overestimated by the present SW potential.
It is because we have ignored the long-range interactions, which contribute mostly to the acoustic phonon branches while have neglectable contribution to the optical phonon branches.
The short-range interac- tion has thus been strengthened to give an accurate description for the acoustic phonon branches and the elastic properties, which leads to the overestimation of the optical phonon branches as a trade-off.
Hence, there will be systematic overestimation for simulating optical processes using the present SW parameters.
We also note that the mathematical form of the SW potential is not suitable for the atomic-thick planar structures, such as graphene and b-BN, because the SW potential is not able to resist the bending motion of these real planar crystals [121, 122]. 10 20 30 0 0  0.05  0.1 0.15 0.2 Stress (N/m) Strain x 1K x 300K y 1K y 300K Figure 326.
