This is the case in Ni2MnGa, where the martensite transition is at the heart of the striking magnetic shape memory and magnetocaloric properties.
Interestingly, the martensitic transformation is preceded by a premartensite phase, and the role of this precursor and its inﬂuence on the martensitic transition and properties is still a matter of debate.
In this work we report on the inﬂuence of Co doping (Ni50−xCoxMn25Ga25 with x = 3 and 5) on the martensitic transformation path in stoichiometric Ni2MnGa by neutron diffraction.
The use of the superspace formalism to describe the crystal structure of the modulated martensitic phases, joined with a group theoretical analysis, allows unfolding the different distortions featuring the structural transitions.
Finally, a general Landau thermodynamic potential of the martensitic transformation, based on the symmetry analysis, is outlined.
The combined use of phenomenological and crystallographic studies highlights the close relationship between the lattice distortions at the core of the Ni2MnGa physical properties and, more in general, on the properties of the martensitic transformations in the Ni-Mn based Heusler systems.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.101.094105 I. INTRODUCTION Martensitic transformations, diffusionless, displacive, and ﬁrst order transitions from a high symmetry austenite phase to a low symmetry martensite phase [1], are strain-driven phase transitions observed in different classes of materials [1,2].
The transformation is characterized by the appearance of strong lattice strains frequently joined with shufﬂes and/or shears of speciﬁc lattice planes resulting in macroscopic changes of the crystal shape and of the material microstructure [1].
Diverse and striking physical phenomena occur at the martensitic transformation ranging from enhancement of the material’s mechanical strength [1,2], shape memory effects [3], magneto- and mechanocaloric effects [4,5], and even exotic new topological states [6].
The knowledge of marten- site symmetry and how the distortions develop during the transformation are pivotal in understanding the functional physical properties characterizing such materials [7,8].
Heusler alloys are a wide class of materials showing martensitic transformations induced by different external stimuli such as temperature changes [9–13], magnetic ﬁeld [14,15], as well as applied strain and pressure [13,16–18].
Moreover, the Heusler structure is able to host a large variety of chemical species by adjusting the lattice symmetry and distortions [13,19–24], resembling the structural ﬂexibility observed in perovskite oxides.
The ideal cubic structure of *Corresponding author: fabio.orlandi@stfc.ac.uk austenite can undergo symmetry-breaking transitions show- ing close analogies to perovskite distortions [19].
Let us consider a martensitic transformation that takes place from a high-temperature cubic L21 austenite phase (space group Fm3m1′) to a low-temperature tetragonal nonmodulated L10 martensite phase (I4/mmm1′).
The martensitic distortion is usually driven by a tetragonal strain acting on the Mn co- ordination polyhedra like a Jahn-Teller distortion as shown in Fig. 1.
This local effect is known to occur in perovskite oxides, and was also observed in the Ni2MnGa system from neutron diffraction experiments and asserted as a band Jahn- Teller effect [25,26].
For some compositions, the martensitic transformation is also associated with a periodic shift of speciﬁc lattices planes that can give rise to commensurate and incommensurate structure modulations [11,21–23,27].
These displacive modulations can be viewed as a way for the lattice to maintain the proper geometrical bond requirements and can be compared with the characteristic oxygen tilting patterns in perovskite materials [28,29].
Many efforts of the research community were dedicated to the understanding of the various lattice distortions in perovskite materials [30] and how the interplay between them leads to functional properties like multiferroicity [31,32].
In this paper we will apply the formalisms generally used in the perovskite materials to the martensitic transforma- tion in Ni2MnGa Heusler alloys.
Depending on composition, Ni50Mn45−xZx (Z = Ga, In, Sb, Sn) alloys show a wide range of multifunctional properties related to the martensitic transformation, ranging from magnetic shape memory effects 2469-9950/2020/101(9)/094105(13) 094105-1 ©2020 American Physical SocietyFABIO ORLANDI et al.

[14,33,34], giant magneto- and barocaloric effects [4,5,35,36], to exotic magnetic properties [12,37].
These technologically relevant properties arise from the relationship between dif- ferent degrees of freedom in the material: magnetism, spon- taneous strains, displacive modulation, and the interplay of these with the system entropy [5].
All resemble the interaction of the different ferroic orderings in multiferroic materials that is strictly linked to the coupling of the different nuclear and magnetic distortions [38].
It is therefore interesting to investigate the lattice and magnetic distortions and their cou- pling.
To fulﬁll this purpose, we start from the experimental observation of the change in the martensitic transformation path in stoichiometric Ni2MnGa induced by small Co doping.
Ni2MnGa can be considered the archetype of Ni-Mn based Heusler alloys, and has been widely studied in literature.
It undergoes a martensitic transformation from a cubic austenite phase, described with the Fm3m1′ space group, to a 5M mod- ulated martensite structure below 210 K [22].
The martensitic transformation is preceded by a “premartensite” phase below 260 K [10,26,39].
This phase can be described as a modulated austenite phase with an incommensurate modulation vector close to the commensurate (1/3 1/3 0) value (deﬁned with respect to the cubic parent structure).
The nature of this pre- martensite phase and its role in the martensitic transformation are still a matter of debate [40–42], justifying the need of a detailed symmetry analysis of the transformation.
Two main theories are usually considered when trying to explain the martensitic transformation in Ni2MnGa and related compounds: a soft phonon model [40] and an adap- tive one [41,43,44].
In the latter, the modulated martensite phase is described as a long-range ordered arrangement of nanodomains of the L10 tetragonal structure.
The strict ge- ometrical relation between the austenite and martensite lat- tices, due the conservation of the habit plane [44], and the minimization of the elastic energy [43], restrict the periodicity of the modulated phases.
The adaptive model considers the modulated martensite phase as a metastable phase and the tetragonal nonmodulated L10 phase as the only thermodynam- ically stable martensitic phase [43,44].
This model is able to correctly describe the mechanical properties of the marten- site phases together with the magnetic anisotropy [41,45,46].
Nevertheless, it also shows some limitation: (i) the observa- tion of incommensurate structures is not well justiﬁed and are explained by the presence of stacking faults in the ordered twinning pattern; (ii) it does not fully account for the presence of the premartensite phase, in which the tetragonal strain is not quantiﬁable but the modulation satellites are still present; and (iii) it does not explain why the nanotwinning need to be periodic on a large scale, which is needed to explain the observation of sharp Bragg reﬂections.
The soft-phonon model takes into account the experimen- tally observed softening in the [ζζ0] TA2 phonon branch at ζ ≈0.33 [40].
This theory has been mainly developed in the ferroelectric community [47] and it is based on the observation that one, or a limited number of phonons, posses a lower frequency that decreases with temperature, eventually becoming unstable at the transition.
In its ﬁrst description this theory required a complete softening of the phonon mode and a classical second order phase transition [47–49].
This is not the case in Ni2MnGa where an incomplete softening of the unstable phonon and a ﬁrst order transition are observed.
Nevertheless, Krumhansl and Gooding [49] show that the requirement of a complete softening of the phonon mode and a second order transition is not a strict requirement and can be overcome, for example, considering a coupling between the soft phonon mode and spontaneous strains [50].
In the case of Ni2MnGa this theory is criticized on the lack of a complete phonon softening and on the fact that it fails to explain the presence of the precursor phase [40].
Recently Gruner et al. [44] proposed a stricter relation between the phonon softening and the adaptive nanotwinning.
In this work we will show an experimental proof of a direct coupling between the incommensurate modulation (the soft-phonon mode) and the tetragonal strain.
We will also provide a Landau thermodynamical potential based on the symmetry of the parent austenite phase and the daughter martensite phases that formally shows the phenomenological effect of the latter coupling on the macroscopic properties of this systems, strengthening the soft-phonon model.
These conclusions are based on neutron diffraction data collected on Co-doped Ni2MnGa alloys.
The macroscopic properties and the symmetry of the martensite phase in Ni2MnGa are very sensitive to small variations of the composition [11,12,21,23,24,36,51,52], so that varying the concentration gives the opportunity to gain insights on the martensitic transformation.
In particular, the substitution of Co in the Ni sublattice inﬂuences both magnetic and structural properties of the alloy [12,24,36,51,52], allowing the direct observation of the coupling between the different degrees of freedom. II.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Ni50−xCoxMn25Ga25 samples (x = 3, 5 nominal) were pre- pared by arc melting of high purity elements (99.99%).
In- gots were sealed in quartz tubes under 300 mbar of Ar and then annealed at 1073 K for 5 days.
The sample composi- tions and uniformity were determined by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis using a scanning electron micro- scope.
The stoichiometries are Ni46.04Co2.59Mn25.96Ga25.42 and Ni44.54Co4.97Mn25.35Ga25.13.
The uniformity is within 0.05%.
094105-2NEUTRON DIFFRACTION AND SYMMETRY ANALYSIS OF … PHYSICAL REVIEW B 101, 094105 (2020) Temperature-dependent magnetization M(T ) measure- ments were performed with a superconducting quantum in- terference device magnetometer (SQUID) under a 5 mT ap- plied ﬁeld in the temperature range 5 ⩽T ⩽650 K with a 4 K min−1 sweeping rate.
An oven was attached to the mag- netometer for the high-temperature measurements.
The mea- surements were carried out in a zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC), ﬁeld- cooling (FC), and ﬁeld-cooled-warming sequence (FCW).
The neutron powder-diffraction data were collected on the time-of-ﬂight WISH diffractometer at the ISIS facility (UK) [53].
The powder sample was loaded in a thin vana- dium sample holder and measured between 5 and 500 K with a hot-stage closed-circuit refrigerator.
Rietveld reﬁne- ments were performed using the Jana2006 software [54], and group theoretical calculations were carried out with the help of the ISOTROPY suite [55,56].
The symmetry-mode analysis [30,57] of the martensitic sequence of transitions in Ni2−xCoxMnGa is performed with the help of the ISODIS- TORT software [55] using the reﬁned paramagnetic (PM) austenite phases and the relative distorted structures.
The Lan- dau thermodynamic potential was constructed with the help of the ISOTROPY suite [56] and INVARIANT software [58]. III.
RESULTS A. Magnetization M(T ) obtained in a 5 mT applied ﬁeld for the two samples studied in the present work are shown in Fig. 2.
All com- positions show a sharp transition above 400 K indicating the ferromagnetic (FM) Curie temperature of the austenite phase (T A C ).
As already reported by Kanomata et al. [52], T A C of the austenite phase increases with increasing Co concentration.
The estimated transition temperatures, 405 and 437 K for x = 3 and 5, respectively, are in agreement with those given in Ref. [52].
Both compounds undergo at low temperatures a martensitic phase transition, which is accompanied by a hys- teresis between the FC and FCW M(T ) data.
The ZFC state is obtained by cooling the sample from 380 K to the lowest temperature.
Since 380 K corresponds to a temperature within the FM state for these two samples, and not to a temperature in the PM state, M(T ) does not become zero at the lowest temperature, and a certain ﬁnite value remains.
Nevertheless, the splitting between the ZFC and FCW curves indicates the presence of mixed magnetic exchange with competing non- FM and FM components.
The sample with x = 3 shows two features in M(T ) around TI ≈160 K and TII ≈120 K.
The sequence of the transitions resembles the behavior observed for the Ni2MnGa composition which is characterized by a premartensitic transition around TI ≈260 K followed by the martensitic transformation around TII ≈210 K [39].
On the other hand, the sample with x = 5 exhibits a single transition around 90 K.
The details of these transitions are examined more closely with neutron diffraction experiments presented below.

We show as an example the data obtained for Ni47Co3Mn25Ga25 in Fig. 3.
We obtain good reliability factors of the Rietveld reﬁnements by adopting the Fm3m1′ symmetry.
The chemical compositions obtained from structural reﬁnements (by taking advantage of the good contrast of the scattering cross section between the elements, with bMn = −3.73 fm, bNi = 10.3 fm, bCo = 2.73 fm, and bGa = 7.28 fm) are in agreement with the EDX measurements for all investigated compounds (see Tables SI to SV in the Supplemental Material [59]).
In Fig. 4 we show the neutron-diffraction data for Ni47Co3Mn25Ga25 and Ni47Co5Mn25Ga25 obtained at 300 K in the ferromagnetic phase.
We observe below T A C a strong temperature dependence of the cubic 111 reﬂection intensity and the absence of extra reﬂections indicating the presence of a k = (000) propagation vector for the FM austenite phase [insets Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)].
The T A C obtained as 431(3) and 449(7) K are slightly higher than the values obtained from M(T ).
The magnetic symmetry analysis in the FM state was performed by referencing to the PM austenite structure and the observed propagation vector; assuming magnetic ordering 094105-3FABIO ORLANDI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 101, 094105 (2020) FIG. 3.

of both Ni and Mn sites.
The details of the analysis are given in Appendix A. It is worth stressing here that although the resolution of the present diffraction experiment is not sensitive enough to detect a possible magnetoelastic coupling, the occurrence of very small lattice distortions cannot be excluded a priori.
The correct symmetry of the magnetic state is assigned by combining the knowledge of the magnetic anisotropy and symmetry information associated with the phase transition.
First, from the integrated intensity of the 111 reﬂection as a function of temperature and from the absence of thermal hysteresis around T A C in M(T ) (Fig. 2), it is evident that the magnetic transition progresses as second order.
Second, liter- ature related to prototypical Ni2MnGa and off-stoichiometric compositions indicate the occurrence of a uniaxial type of ferromagnetism along one of the fundamental [001]C crystal- lographic axis [60].
These evidences are consistent only with the I4/mm′m′ magnetic space group.
For all compositions, the reﬁnements of the tetragonal magnetic space group indicate the presence of ordered magnetic moment only on the Mn sublattices along the [001]C direction.
The moment on the Ni/Co sites can be considered as negligible or below the sensitivity of our diffraction experiment.

weak reﬂections indicate that the new phase is modulated (see inset Fig. 5).
This whole set of new peaks can be indexed based on a pseudoaustenitic lattice with a modulation vector q ≈(0.3 0.3 0).
The values of the propagation vector and the weak intensities of the satellite reﬂections are characteristic of the premartensitic transformation as observed for Ni2MnGa [10,25,39,61], NiTi [62], and Ni1−xAlx alloys [63].
However, contrary to the 3% Co sample, the Ni2MnGa system, as well as NiTi and Ni1−xAlx, does not show any strain in the premartensite phase even with high-resolution synchrotron data [10,39].
The modulated state for TII < T < TI is described within the superspace formalism [64–66].

No evident changes in the magnetic contribution to the diffraction pattern were observed across the TI transition, indicating small changes in the ferromagnetic structure.
Pre- vious works indicate, in fact, that the b axis of the martensite cell described in this work (corresponding to the cubic [001] direction) is the magnetic easy axis [60,67].
A ferromagnetic ordering of the Mn spins along the b direction corresponds to the magnetic superspace group Im′mm′(00γ )s00.

in Fig. 5(a), whereas crystal data and atomic positions are reported in Tables SVI and SVII, respectively [59].
The reﬁned modulated structure is characterized by a sinusoidal modulation of the x position of all the atoms present in the structure with amplitudes very similar to the one observed in the premartensite phase of the stoichiometric Co-free compound [10] (see Table SVII [59] and Fig. 6).
Although the lattice symmetry is orthorhombic, the reﬁne- ment of the cell parameters converged to a tetragonal metric with equal amplitude of the incommensurate displacement for the Mn and Ga site.
As for the austenite phase, the ordered moment on the Ni site can be considered zero within 3σ.
It is worth stressing that neutron diffraction allows us to determine only the average values of the ordered magnetic moment on the crystallographic site and not the single value for Ni and Co.
Kanomata et al. [52] suggest, from electronic-structure calculation, the value of ≈1 μB per Co atoms and ≈0.25 μB per Ni that leads to an average moment on the site of ≈0.3 μB. The second transition at TII is characterized by a sudden jump of the cell parameters as can be seen in Fig. 7.
It is worth noting that the modulation vector changes its periodicity from the almost commensurate position to q ≈(0.38 0.38 0) (deﬁned in the pseudocubic austenite cell).
The diffraction data indicate that the transition is of the ﬁrst order with a clear phase coexistence as observed in the reﬁnement of the 120 K data (see Fig. S1 [59]).
There is no evidence in the diffraction pattern of any extra reﬂections, ruling out the possibility of a violation of the current symmetry and the stabilization of a new modulation/superstructure.
The diffraction data indicate that the transformation is driven by the tetragonal and or- thorhombic lattice strains solely, excluding symmetry change and deﬁning it as an isomorphic transition.

5 K was then conducted in the Im′mm′(00γ )s00 superspace space group.
The resulting Rietveld plot is shown in Fig. 5, whereas the crystal information are available in Tables SVII and SIX [59].
The reﬁned crystal structure is very similar to the martensite phase below TI with larger amplitudes of the sinusoidal modulation (twice as big) and larger strains.
Very weak, second order satellites were observed, but their intensity can be reproduced with the ﬁrst order harmonic modulation described in Table SIX [68,69].
As for the TI phase, the magnetism is mostly related to the Mn site, and the size of the moment does not change signiﬁcantly with respect to the other two phases.
The reﬁnement of the moment on the Ni site converges to a ﬁnite value with statistical signiﬁ- cance.
Nevertheless, the observed moment is very small and the reﬁnement reliability factors do not change signiﬁcantly with the additional parameters.
It is possible in any case to conclude that the Ni site probably shows a ferromagnetic arrangement with respect to the Mn spins (reﬁnement with an AFM coupling has higher reliability factor and eventually converges back to the FM alignment) with a small ordered moment around 0.2 μB, in agreement with the electronic- structure calculation in Ref. [52]. Ni45Co5Mn25Ga25.

The inset shows a zoom of the diffraction patter highlighting some satellite reﬂections around the 111 reﬂection.
tetragonal splitting of the 200 reﬂection is evident (see Fig. 8) together with the appearance of weak satellite reﬂections as can be seen, for instance, around the 111 reﬂection of the cubic austenite (see inset Fig. 8).
Differently from the transition at TII in the 3% Co sample, the change of the lattice parameter is abrupt underlining a ﬁrst order transition, conﬁrmed also by the observed phase coexistence and from the thermal hysteresis in the magnetization measurements (Fig. 2).
This transition clearly resembles the TII transition in the 3% Co compound, but the features of the modulation are more related to the ﬁrst martensitic phase observed below TI in the 3% Co sample, namely the value of the modula- tion vector and the weak satellite reﬂections.
The martensite phase was reﬁned against the data collected at 5 K in the Im′mm′(00γ )s00 magnetic superspace group.
The crystal data and the atomic positions are reported in Tables SX and SXI, respectively [59], whereas a Rietveld plot of the reﬁnement at 5 K is shown in Fig. 8.
As for the other martensitic phases, only the sinusoidal modulation wave for each position were reﬁned, and the obtained values are in the middle of the ones observed in the 3% Co phases.
The lattice shows a slight orthorhombic distortion, and the ferromagnetic arrangement of the Mn moment is retained across the martensite transfor- mation.
The reﬁnements yield a very small moment on the Ni/Co sublattice, but also in this case, the statistical relevance of the result is very limited.

DISCUSSION The high resolution neutron diffraction data hereby re- ported allows us to gain important insights on the martensitic transformation.
To obtain this information we performed a mode decomposition analysis [30,57] of the experimentally reﬁned structures.
Such analysis supplies the decomposi- tion of the distorted structure in terms of symmetry-adapted modes, allowing the identiﬁcation of the distortions hierar- chy and elucidate the driving mechanisms of the transitions [30,57].
The mode decomposition analysis [30,57], performed on the ferromagnetic austenite phases, indicates that the sole m+ 4 mode assumes ﬁnite amplitude, which is directly pro- portional to the Mn and Ni magnetic moment.
As pointed out previously, no changes of the magnetic structure were de- tected from the neutron data at the martensitic transformations indicating that the magnetic degree of freedom is not pivotal in these transitions.
The results of the mode analysis across the martensitic transitions temperatures for both compounds are shown in Fig. 10.
In the top panels the total amplitude of the displacive modulation 2 mode is shown.
This symmetry mode is related to the incommensurate sinusoidal displacement, and its ampli- tude is proportional to the order parameter η.
On the lower panels the amplitudes of the tetragonal and orthorhombic strains are reported.
These two modes are described by the + 3 and + 5 representations, respectively, and their amplitudes are proportional to the order parameters ξ and σ.
By looking to the amplitudes in Fig. 10, the 2 mode represents the main distortion, being six times greater than the tetragonal strain + 3 and two order of magnitude bigger than the orthorhombic strain + 5 .
This simple evaluation allows identifying the η (2 mode) and the ξ (+ 3 modes) order parameters as the driving distortions featuring the austenite to martensite phase transition.
The temperature dependence of the two order parameters across the transitions draws an interesting scenario.
In the 3% doped sample, at TI, η follows a power-law dependence with a critical exponent β = 0.52(5) (Fig. 10).
Interestingly, the tetragonal strain ξ, below TI, starts to increase linearly in the same temperature range indicating a close correlation with the modulation amplitude evolution.
Speciﬁcally, the strain order parameter ξ is a secondary order parameter induced by the displacive modulation η, at least in this temperature range.
The two order parameters are coupled, by symmetry, with a linear quadratic invariant ξη2 ruling the experimentally observed temperature behavior.
At TII in the 3% Co sample, both distortion modes present a clear discontinuity indicating a ﬁrst order transition.
In the 5% doped sample, a single ﬁrst order transition is observed, in which the 2 and + 3 modes follow the same temperature evolution, again indicating a strong coupling between the order parameters.
It is possible to rationalize these observation within the Landau phenomenological theory and show that the marten- sitic transformation can be described within the soft phonon model.
The symmetry constrained Landau free energy po- tential F(η, ξ ) for the orthorhombic martensite transition is described in Appendix B and we refer to that for details.
The mode decomposition clearly indicates the presence of two strongly coupled primary order parameters in the martensitic transformation.
Moreover, the presence of two clear transi- tions in the 3% Co compound but also in the parent Ni2MnGa [25,39] and other alloy compositions indicate that both order parameters present a clear instability, which takes place at different characteristic temperatures mainly depending on the lattice structure and chemical composition.
In the 3% Co system, as well in Ni2MnGa, the martensitic transition de- velops in two steps.
First, the “premartensite” phase appears: this phase transition is driven only by the displacive order parameter η, and the tetragonal strain appears as secondary order parameter as observed in the 3% Co sample as well as in Pt-doped samples [11].
The premartensite phase in the parent compound Ni2MnGa [25,39] does not show any measurable tetragonal strain nevertheless being allowed by symmetry it will be present.
Further decrease in the temperature induces the “proper” martensite transition that is related to the strain instability [25,39].
In both the Ni2MnGa system and in the 3% Co-doped composition, but also in Pt-doped samples [11], the prominent increase of the strain (see TII in Fig. 10) induces a renormalization of the modulation amplitude and an increase 094105-7FABIO ORLANDI et al.

In the top panels is shown the total amplitude of the 2 displacive mode representative of the sinusoidal displacement of the atoms in the martensite states, the red line represents the best ﬁt with a critical law ∝(T −TC)β see text for details.
The bottom panel shows the evolution across the martensitic transition of the tetragonal strain + 3 (left axis) and of the orthorhombic strain + 5 (right axis), the red line represent a linear ﬁt of the + 3 strain close to the TI transition temperature.
The dashed lines indicate the critical temperatures TI and TII. of the modulation vector component as well.
It is then possible to consider both these transitions as two distinct martensitic transformations: the ﬁrst one driven solely by the displacive modulation and the second one by the lattice strain.
These features can be explained by considering the linear quadratic coupling −d1ξη2 present in the Landau free energy (see Appendix B) and how this effects the martensitic transi- tion.
Let us deﬁne Tη and Tξ the characteristic temperatures of the order parameters.
When Tξ is close to Tη, like in the 3% Co compound, the ξη2 coupling term can renormalize the quadratic coefﬁcient of the displacement order parameter as ( a2 2 −d1ξ )η2 [31,70,71].
The a2 parameter can be described within the soft phonon mode as m∗ω2 0, where omega is the frequency of the soft mode and m∗is its effective mass.
In the soft phonon model the frequency ω0 should continuously decrease to zero following the law ω0 = [ a2,0(T −TC) m∗ ]1/2.
Ex- perimentally this is not the case since a ﬁrst order phase transition is observed in both Co-doped compounds as well as an incomplete softening of the unstable phonon is observed in the parent Ni2MnGa alloys [40].
Nevertheless, if we consider the presence of the linear quadratic coupling −d1ξη2 and if the coupling coefﬁcient d1 is large enough the transitions become of the ﬁrst order [31,49,50,70,71].
Of course there might be other reasons for the transition to be of the ﬁrst order type, as explained in Appendix B, nonetheless the experimental observation of the coupling between the orders parameters indicate it as the more likely candidate to explain the incomplete softening and the ﬁrst order character of the incommensurate displacement transition.
It is now interesting to analyze the situation where Tξ > Tη.
For T > Tξ > Tη both a1 and a2 parameters (see Appendix B for deﬁnitions) are positive and the austenite phase is the minimum of F(η, ξ ).
For Tη < T < Tξ the a1 term became negative indicating that the thermodynamic potential has a minimum for a ﬁnite value of the tetragonal strain.
In this case, if d1ξ < a2(T ) 2 the renormalized quadratic coefﬁcient of the displacive modulation assumes a negative value and the transition to the modulated state occurs although the temperature is higher than the characteristic temperature Tη.
This scenario is likely to happen in case of strongly ﬁrst order transitions of the lattice strain as shown by Toledano in the case of the nuclear transition in benzyl [72] and in a more general way from Salje et al. [31] regarding multiferroic phase transitions.
In these conditions the two strongly coupled order parameters will follow the same temperature behavior [31] as observed in the 5% doped compound (see Fig. 10 right side), but more importantly as it is been observed in the martensitic transformation of Ni-Mn-X (X = In, Sn, Sb) metamagnetic alloys [35,73,74].
V. CONCLUSION The symmetry of the martensitic transformation in the Ni- Mn-Ga and related compounds has been discussed in detail, starting from the experimental observation of the martensitic transformation in the Co-doped sample of Ni2MnGa and from the description of the latter through a symmetry constrained thermodynamic potential.
The analysis allows a straightfor- ward description of the properties and characteristic of the transformation, highlighting the fundamental role played by the linear quadratic coupling between the displacement and the tetragonal strain.
The experimental observation of this coupling points to a primary role of the displacive modu- lation in the martensitic transformation.

The −d1ξη2 coupling also act as a renormalization on the displacement transition temperature explaining the strong ﬁrst ordered martensitic transformation observed in the metam- agnetic Ni-Mn-X composition as well as the stress induced martensite transition.
It is also worth mentioning that the ap- plication of an external tetragonal strain to the austenite phase, for example as uniaxial stress along [001] cubic direction, can trigger the martensite transition to the incommensurate state thanks to the same coupling invariant, whereas the applica- tion of isotropic pressure will promote the austenitic phase.
Clearly the engineering and the control of the lattice strains become pivotal to the design of the material properties, and the stability and the composition of the austenitic lattice, in particular of the fcc sublattices, will determine the character- istic of the transformation.

APPENDIX A: MAGNETIC SYMMETRY OF THE AUSTENITE PHASE By taking the Fm3m1′ space group as a parent structure we performed magnetic symmetry analysis, with the help of the ISODISTORT software [56], assuming the ordering of both Mn and Ni sublattices.
The symmetry analysis leads to six possible magnetic space groups deriving from the m+ 4 irreducible representation (irreps) with different order parameter directions (ODP) (see Table I).
The corresponding magnetic structures are reported in Fig. 11, in all the cases the relative orientation of the spins is ferromagnetic within each sublattice, but with different magnetic anisotropy di- rection and induced strain components, in agreement with the magnetic symmetry.
As an example in the present case the magnetic space group I4/mm′m′ allows the occurrence of spontaneous strains in the lattice.
In particular, it allows the tetragonal strain + 3 (ξ) that is induced from the primary magnetic mode μ.
This magnetoelastic coupling is described in the system free energy by the linear quadratic coupling term ξμ2 and gives the possibility to control the spontaneous tetragonal strain with an external magnetic ﬁeld as observed in magnetic-shape memory alloys [14].
In the present work this magnetoelastic coupling is not directly observed in the diffraction data but being allowed by symmetry, it will have a ﬁnite value.
APPENDIX B: LANDAU FREE ENERGY FOR THE MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION: ORTHORHOMBIC CASE The mode decomposition reported in the main text indi- cates two main distortions driving the two martensitic trans- formations.
The Landau free energy for the phase transi- tion is envisaged to be composed by these two distortions: (i) the tetragonal strain that transform as the two-dimensional irreducible representation + 3 (ξ ) and (ii) the incommensurate displacive distortion that transform as the 12-dimensional 2 (η) irreducible representation.
In the ﬁrst approximation, the magnetic order parameter can be considered unchanged across the structural transition as the ordering temperature falls considerably far from the martensite transition.
For these reason we exclude it from the description.
The symmetry- constrained free energy can be written as follows: F(η, ξ ) = a1 2 ξ 2 + b1 3 ξ 3 + c1 4 ξ 4 + a2 2 η2 + c2 4 η4 −d1ξη2, (B1) where a1 = a1,0(T −Tξ ) and a2 = a2,0(T −Tη).
The a2 co- efﬁcient can be related to the softening of the unstable phonon mode along the [δ δ 0] line of the Brillouin zone.
Cochran [47] suggested that, close to the critical tempera- ture, the square of the phonon frequency decrease linearly following m∗ω2 0 ∝(T −TC).
Is it then possible to relate the a2 coefﬁcient in Eq. (B1) to the phonon frequency ω0 through ω0 = a2,0(T −Tη) m∗ 1/2 (B2) In its ﬁrst description the soft phonon mode described sec- ond order transition with a complete softening of the unstable phonon modes [47], but it has been shown that the model can be extended to ﬁrst order transitions explaining the incomplete softening [49,50].
The Landau potential described in Eq. (B1) allows the transition of the η order parameter to be of the second order, nevertheless either the presence of coupling terms between the order parameters or c2 < 0, considering the sixth degree invariant in η, can make the transition ﬁrst order.
The linear quadratic term −d1ξη2 deﬁnes the coupling between the displacive modulation 2 and the tetragonal 094105-9FABIO ORLANDI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 101, 094105 (2020) FIG. 11.

By symmetry, a second linear quadratic cou- pling is allowed between the displacive modulation and the orthorhombic strain + 5 (σ ), but the observation of small values for the latter in most of the Heusler systems allows us to discard this term without loss of information.
It is worth noting that such thermodynamic potential described here is quite common in solid-state physics [71,75], for ex- ample in magnetostructural transition in 3d-metal monox- ides [76,77], in the ferroelastic/ferroelectric transition in benzyl [72], or even in the crystallization of icosahedral quasicrystal [78].
This symmetry-constrained thermodynamic potential al- lows three stable phases with different symmetries: the austenite parent phase (0,0) with Fm3m1′ symmetry, the tetragonal nonmodulated martensite (0,ξ) described in the I4/mmm1′ space group corresponding to the L10 struc- ture, and the modulated martensite phase (η, ξ) with the Im′mm′(00γ )s00 symmetry.
