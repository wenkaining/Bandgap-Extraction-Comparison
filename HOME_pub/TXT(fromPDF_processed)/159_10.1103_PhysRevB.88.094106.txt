PHYSICAL REVIEW B 88, 094106 (2013) Stable hydrogenated graphene edge types: Normal and reconstructed Klein edges Philipp Wagner,1 Viktoria V. Ivanovskaya,2 Manuel Melle-Franco,3 Bernard Humbert,1 Jean-Joseph Adjizian,1 Patrick R. Briddon,4 and Christopher P.

We show that the zigzag is not the most stable fully hydrogenated edge structure along the ⟨2¯1¯10⟩direction.
Instead hydrogenated Klein and reconstructed Klein based edges are found to be energetically more favorable, with stabilities approaching that of armchair edges.
These new structures “unify” graphene edge topology, the most stable ﬂat hydrogenated graphene edges always consisting of pairwise bonded C2H4 edge groups, irrespective of the edge orientation.
When edge rippling is included, CH3 edge groups are most stable.
These new fundamental hydrogen-terminated edges have important implications for graphene edge imaging and spectroscopy, as well as mechanisms for graphene growth, nanotube cutting, and nanoribbon formation and behavior.

All intermediate orientations can be described in terms of alternating sections of these edge orientations,14 in general called chiral edges.
The armchair edge along the ⟨1¯100⟩direction is the most stable unreconstructed suspended graphene edge, both unterminated7,15 and hydrogenated with each edge carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms.6,7 The ⟨2¯1¯10⟩direction is more complex.
Unlike the ⟨1¯100⟩direction, there exist two possibilities to terminate the graphene lattice parallel to the ⟨2¯1¯10⟩direction [see Fig. 1(b)], resulting in either the classic zigzag edge, or the Klein edge with only single neighbor edge carbon atoms.16,17 The largely ignored unterminated pristine Klein edge is highly unstable and can undergo pairwise recon- struction to a pentagon-terminated Klein edge.15 This recon- structed edge nonetheless remains +0.4 eV/ ˚A less stable than unterminated armchair or (5–7) reconstructed zigzag edges.7,15 Further complexity arises for ⟨2¯1¯10⟩edges when hydrogen is terminated.
Recent modeling has shown that the singly hydrogenated zigzag edge can be stabilized through adding a period three hydrogen pair-termination, the z211 edge,6 with the resulting edge no longer magnetic.18 The z211 zigzag edge is to date the most stable ⟨2¯1¯10⟩edge structure proposed in the literature.
This general focus on zigzag and armchair graphene edges means that there has been no discussion of hydrogenated Klein-based edge conﬁgurations so far.
We describe in this paper a study, based on density functional calculations, of hydrogen-terminated Klein and reconstructed Klein edge conﬁgurations.
Furthermore, hydro- genated edge mixtures of reconstructed Klein and zigzag edge sections along the ⟨2¯1¯10⟩direction are explored.
These new edge structures are signiﬁcantly more stable than hydrogen- terminated zigzag edges.
Spin-polarized density functional calculations under the local density approximation were performed as implemented in the AIMPRO code.19–21 The charge density is ﬁtted to plane waves with an energy cutoff of 150 Ha (Ha: Hartree energy).
Electronic level occupation was obtained using a Fermi occu- pation function with kT = 0.04 eV. Relativistic pseudopoten- tials are generated using the Hartwingster-Goedecker-Hutter scheme,22 resulting in basis sets of 22 independent Gaussian functions for carbon and 12 for hydrogen.
All calculations were performed using orthorhombic supercells whose sizes have been checked and chosen to be sufﬁciently large to avoid interaction between neighboring ribbons (vacuum distance be- tween ribbons larger than 15 ˚A).
A ﬁne k-point grid was chosen [armchair GNR: (12/N) × 1 × 1 and zigzag GNR: (18/N) × 1 × 1, where N is the number of fundamental unit cells along the ribbon axis].
Energies are converged to better than 10−7 Ha.
Atomic positions and lattice parameters were geometrically optimized until the maximum atomic position change in a given iteration dropped below 10−5 a0 (a0: Bohr radius).
Molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the self-consistent-charge density functional tight-binding (SCC- DFTB) Hamiltonian23 implemented in the DFTB+ code.24 We run canonical ensemble (number of atoms N, volume V, and temperature T are kept constant, also referred to as NVT ensemble) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an Andersen thermostat with a reselection probability of 0.2 and a time step of 1 fs.
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) of width ∼50 ˚A have been used to model decoupled hydrogen-terminated graphene edges.
Ribbon segments in one unit cell consist of nC carbon atoms and nH hydrogen atoms.
The edge formation energy Eedge (Refs. 6 and 15) is then calculated using Eedge = Eribbon −nC · EC −nH · EH2 2 2L .
(1) Here, Eribbon is the total internal energy of the nanoribbon segment in a unit cell.

EC is the energy of a carbon atom in a perfect graphene sheet, EH2 gives the total internal energy of an isolated H2 molecule.
Although several edge formation energies are found to be negative, this does not necessarily indicate the system favors edge formation over the bulk state under experimental conditions.
Full free energy differences must be considered to address this, including entropy change and chemical potential of the edge components.
Even if edge formation is thermody- namically favored, reaction barriers may be prohibitive.
Edge formation energies for armchair and zigzag edges are compa- rable to those in the literature,6,7,18,25 with small quantitative differences due to choice of exchange correlation functional (for more details see Supplementary Materials).26–28 A nomenclature to differentiate the various hydrogenated edge conﬁgurations is used similar to Wassmann et al.,6 extended by the Klein and the reconstructed Klein edge (a: armchair, z: zigzag, k: Klein, and rk: reconstructed Klein).
The subscripts indicate the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to every edge carbon atom along the periodic edge segment.
The new superscripts u (“up”) and d (“down”) indicate, where needed, out-of-plane edge deformations (edge rippling).12 The edge conﬁgurations rk11 (+0.302 eV/ ˚A), rk21 (+0.134 eV/ ˚A), and rk22 + k2 (+0.034 eV/ ˚A) are all unstable, similar to the singly hydrogenated zigzag edge z1 (+0.105 eV/ ˚A) (see also Supplementary Materials).26 However, the hydrogenated reconstructed Klein edge rk22 is energetically stable with an edge formation energy of −0.030 eV/ ˚A [see Fig. 2(a)].
Notably the new hydrogenated rk22 edge conﬁgu- ration is more than twice as stable as the most stable hydrogen terminated zigzag edge [z211, −0.016 eV/ ˚A, Fig. 2(d)], un- equivocally proving that the most stable hydrogenated ⟨2¯1¯10⟩ oriented edges are not zigzag, but reconstructed Klein based.
The ground state for the reconstructed Klein edge rk22 is magnetic (0.120 μB/ ˚A), similar to the z1 edge (0.128 μB/ ˚A).
Intra edge states couple ferromagnetically, while inter edge coupling18,29–31 is excluded here due to the large ribbon width.
Magnetic zigzag edge states vanish with local defects or variations in hydrogen density (e.g., the z211 edge).18 The perfect rk22 edge should protect the magnetic 2¯1¯10〉 〈 〉 〈 〉 〈 (a) (b) Rec. Klein (rk22) Rec.

edge via periodic insertion of a Klein edge vacancy, i.e., a double hydrogenated zigzag edge site z2.
The resulting rk22 + z2 edge has an edge formation energy of −0.107 eV/ ˚A [Fig. 2(b)], approaching that of fully hydrogenated armchair edges with −0.186 eV/ ˚A [Fig. 2(c)].
As for the z211 edge this increased stability comes through the removal of the edge states around the Fermi level, resulting in a nonmagnetic edge.
As expected, most hydrogenated unreconstructed Klein edges are thermodynamically unstable [(+1.276 eV/ ˚A), k2 (+0.476 eV/ ˚A), k32 (+0.052 eV/ ˚A), and kud 332 (+0.490 eV/ ˚A), see also Supplementary Materials26].
However, the fully hydrogenated Klein edge kud 33 is very stable (−0.150 eV/ ˚A, see Fig. 3).
Here the Klein edge carbon atoms are methylated giving CH3, decoupling them from the sp2 bonded graphene π system.
This stability is only possible with periodic out-of- plane displacement of the edge methyl groups, relieving strain induced by intermethyl steric hindrance.12,33 As for the zigzag and reconstructed Klein edges, the kud 33 can be further stabilized through periodically inserting a Klein vacancy kud 33 + z2 (−0.191 eV/ ˚A), as shown in Fig. 3(b).
This results in a nonmagnetic conﬁguration with a slightly reduced out-of-plane rippling amplitude.
All three edge types (z211, kud 22 + z2, and kud 33 + z2) then show periodic sp2–sp2–sp3 bonding along their zigzag backbone.
We note that on metal surfaces, rippled fully hydrogenated Klein edges are likely to become less stable.
Dehydrogenation is also facilitated,34–36 and dehydrogenated CH3 edge groups could reconstruct to rk22 edges. FIG.
4. (Color online) Edge stability at different hydrogen chem- ical potentials μH2 for hydrogenated edges along the ⟨2¯1¯10⟩direction.
GH2 < 0 indicates graphene instability due to hydrogen “unzipping.” The gray region indicates typical substrate catalyzed (ethylene) chemical vapor deposition growth conditions.
The calculations presented thus far consider perfect vacuum conditions around freestanding graphene edges.
A legitimate question arises, namely, what could be expected in exper- iments?
To consider a molecular hydrogen gas atmosphere around the graphene edge, the calculated total edge formation energy Eedge can be compared to the hydrogen chemical potential μH2, resulting in the relative edge stability GH2 = Eedge −ρH · μH2/2.
(2) Here, ρH = nH 2L gives the hydrogen edge density, with nH the number of hydrogen atoms attached to a graphene ribbon segment of length L.
The hydrogen chemical potential μH2 depends on the pressure and temperature of the system.6 As an indication, at ambient conditions the chemical potential μH2 at 300 K and partial H2 pressure in air of PH2 ≈5 · 10−4 mbar gives μH2 ≈−0.4 eV (Ref. 37).
For both, decreasing PH2 and increasing temperatures, the chemical potential decreases.
In Fig. 4, GH2 is calculated over a realistic range of μH2, for the primary hydrogenated ⟨2¯1¯10⟩edges, identifying regimes of different stable edge types.
For low hydrogen chemical potentials the zigzag hydrogenated edges dominate.
However, for higher pressures and/or moderate growth temperatures the new rk22 + z2 and kud 33 + z2 conﬁgurations become favorable, starting around μH2 ⩾−0.7 eV. Up to μH2 = −0.4 eV several different hydrogenated edge conﬁgurations are very close in energy, thermodynamically dominated by the new most stable identiﬁed Klein and reconstructed Klein conﬁgura- tions.
Such low temperature and higher pressure conditions (μH2 ≈−1.2 to −0.5 eV) are currently of interest for cost efﬁcient chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene growth on metal surfaces.38–41 Given the close proximity in stability of these edge structures under typical CVD growth conditions, many of them may occur during growth.
Possible growth mechanisms based on carbon dimers (C2) as fundamental building blocks are proposed in Fig. 5.
The inclusion of reconstructed Klein edges opens the door to alternative reaction pathways including (5–7) reconstructed edges and Stone-Thrower-Wales bond rotations [e.g., Fig. 5(c)].
These could provide an explanation for observed kinetic growth barriers on metal surfaces tentatively associated with graphene lattice construction.40 Such edges could also form when tailoring graphene sheets42,43 or unzipping carbon nanotubes.44,45 An armchair nanotube can be opened along its axis giving a nanoribbon 094106-3PHILIPP WAGNER et al.

with either zigzag or reconstructed Klein edges depending on the cutting line (see Fig. 6).
Under vacuum conditions the zigzag terminated ribbon is 0.32–0.82 eV/ ˚A more stable than the reconstructed Klein.
However, with hydrogen present the reconstructed Klein terminated ribbon is 0.03–0.36 eV/ ˚A more stable than the zigzag, the precise energy difference depending on the edge conﬁgurations.26 To better explore the edge structures that can form during tube unzipping under experimentally relevant conditions, we next simulated pyrrolidine functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) since they have been found to unzip in a vacuum.46 A pyrrolidine group is formed when an azomethine ylide (CH2NHCH2) bonds to two C atoms of the tube.47 We modeled a 3-nm-long (5,5) carbon nanotube functionalized with 12 pyrrolidine groups perpendicular to the tube axis [Fig. 7(a)].
The number and position of the functional groups was chosen to promote the unzipping.

A few atoms no longer chemically bonded to the tube are taken out of the simulation.
The system is then relaxed and run for 20 ps more to produce the ﬁnal ﬂat nanoribbon structure, Fig. 7(c).
Of the 24 unzipped C atoms at the new boundaries, 19 show Klein edges (four reconstructed) of which ten C atoms have sp3 character.
A variety of Klein-related edge units can be observed along the unzipping line, including rk22, k2, and k3 species.
Thus these simulations suggest that Klein-based edge formation during pyrrolidine unzipping of carbon nanotubes occurs.
The new hydrogenated reconstructed Klein edges presented here allow us to create a uniﬁed picture of hydrogenated graphene edges.
The formation energies for hydrogenated ⟨1¯100⟩armchair and ⟨2¯1¯10⟩reconstructed Klein edges are similar, with both containing C2H4 motifs (see Fig. 8).
It is easy to imagine intermediate chiral edges constructed similarly.
For example, chiral periodic edges observed experimentally from unzipped carbon nanotubes48 appear to bear some similarity to such structures, often using intermediate temperature (∼300 ◦C) H2 plasma treatment to clean the graphene edges.49 Reconstructed Klein edges may be difﬁcult to observe experimentally.
High resolution electron microscopy studies will rapidly detach edge hydrogen, rendering the reconstructed Klein edge unstable.
Scanning tunneling microscopy experi- ments under relatively low voltage bias are likely to observe a zigzag type edge.
This is because the C2H4 reconstructed Klein edge groups are sp3 coordinated with deeper electronic 094106-4STABLE HYDROGENATED GRAPHENE EDGE TYPES: NORMAL . . .

Although the DFT calculations presented here concern only hydrogenation of graphene edges we anticipate a qualitatively similar stability of ⟨2¯1¯10⟩reconstructed Klein edges with different edge functional groups.12,13 In summary, we show here that the most stable hydro- genated graphene edges along ⟨2¯1¯10⟩are not the previously reported zigzag edge structures, but instead reconstructed Klein edge structures (rk22 and rk22 + z2).
The stability of these edges and their derivatives approaches that of hydrogenated armchair edges.
Edge methylation stabilizes edges still further, but only under the condition that the edge groups can undergo signiﬁcant out-of-plane edge rippling.
The new stable hydrogenated edge types are predicted to occur under experimentally attainable conditions, as demon- strated via molecular dynamics simulations of pyrrolidine promoted unzipping of carbon nanotubes.
The most stable edge structures are all nonmagnetic.
It will be important to revisit previous experimental studies, notably on graphene nanoribbon production, in light of these new edge types.
