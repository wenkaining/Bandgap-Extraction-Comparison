Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Inverted Type-II Semiconductors Chaoxing Liu,1,2 Taylor L. Hughes,2 Xiao-Liang Qi,2 Kang Wang,3 and Shou-Cheng Zhang2 1Center for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China 2Department of Physics, McCullough Building, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-4045, USA 3Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095-1594, USA (Received 24 January 2008; published 11 June 2008) The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a topologically nontrivial state of quantum matter which preserves time-reversal symmetry; it has an energy gap in the bulk, but topologically robust gapless states at the edge.
Recently, this novel effect has been predicted and observed in HgTe quantum wells and in this Letter we predict a similar effect arising in Type-II semiconductor quantum wells made from InAs=GaSb=AlSb.
The quantum well exhibits an ‘‘inverted’’ phase similar to HgTe=CdTe quantum wells, which is a QSH state when the Fermi level lies inside the gap.
Due to the asymmetric structure of this quantum well, the effects of inversion symmetry breaking are essential.
Remarkably, the topological quantum phase transition between the conventional insulating state and the quantum spin Hall state can be continuously tuned by the gate voltage, enabling quantitative investigation of this novel phase transition.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.236601 PACS numbers: 72.20.i, 72.25.Dc, 73.63.Hs Recently, a striking prediction of a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator phase in HgTe=CdTe quantum wells (QW) [1] was conﬁrmed in transport experiments [2].
The QSH phase [3,4] is a topologically nontrivial state of matter reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall effect, but where time-reversal symmetry is preserved instead of being broken by the large magnetic ﬁeld.
The state is characterized by a bulk charge-excitation gap and topo- logically protected helical edge states, where states of opposite spin counterpropagate on each edge [3,5,6].
Unfortunately, high-quality HgTe=CdTe QW are very spe- cial, and only a few academic research groups have the precise material control needed to carry out such delicate experiments.
We are therefore lead to search for other, more conventional, materials that exhibit the QSH effect.
We introduce a new material with the QSH phase: InAs=GaSb=AlSb Type-II semiconductor QW in the in- verted regime [7–12].
We show that this quantum well has a subband inversion transition as a function of layer thick- ness, similar to the HgTe=CdTe system, and can be char- acterized by an effective four-band model near the transition.
This model is similar to the model for HgTe=CdTe [1], but contains terms describing the strong bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) and structural inversion asymmetry (SIA).
In fact, due to the unique band align- ment of InAs=GaSb=AlSb, the electron subband and the hole subband are localized in different quantum well layers.
Treated within the self-consistent formalism [13– 15], the intrinsic asymmetry and the band alignment leads to novel effects which we discuss below.
After the demonstration of the QSH state, the key fun- damental question concerns the nature of the topological quantum phase transition between the conventional insu- lating state and the QSH state.
Unfortunately, in HgTe quantum wells, this phase transition can only be tuned by the thickness of the quantum well, which is a discrete variable.
In this work, we show that the asymmetric InAs=GaSb=AlSb quantum well, with strong built-in elec- tric ﬁeld, can be electrically tuned through the phase transition using front and back gates.
Therefore, this sys- tem offers the unique possibility to quantitatively inves- tigate the topological quantum phase transition by continuously tuning the gate voltage.
Additionally, this system also allows one to construct a quantum spin Hall ﬁeld effect transistor (FET), where the gate voltage can switch between the ‘‘OFF’’ state of a conventional insulat- ing state, and a nearly dissipationless ‘‘ON’’ state with the conducting edge channels of the QSH state.
The QW structures in which we are interested are asym- metric with AlSb=InAs=GaSb=AlSb layers grown as shown in Fig. 1.
This is an unusual QW system due to the alignment of the conduction and valence band edges of InAs and GaSb.
The valence band edge of GaSb is 0.15 eV higher than the conduction band edge of the InAs layer.
The AlSb layers serve as conﬁning outer barriers.
The ‘‘conduction’’ subbands are localized in the InAs layer while the ‘‘valence’’ subbands are localized in the GaSb layer as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
Here we focus on the regime where the lowest electron and hole subbands E1, H1, which are derived from the s-like conduction and p-like heavy-hole bands, respectively, are nearly degener- ate, and all other subbands are well separated in energy.
When the quantum well thickness is increased the E1 (H1) band edge decreases (increases).
At a critical thickness a level crossing occurs between E1 and H1, after which the band edge of E1 sinks below that of H1, putting the system into the inverted regime of Type-II QW.
Since the H1 band disperses downwards and the E1 band disperses upwards, the inversion of the band sequence leads to a crossing of the two bands; see Fig. 1(b).
Historically, the inverted regime of InAs=GaSb=AlSb QW was described as a semimetal without a gap [7]. However, Ref.
[8] ﬁrst pointed out that due to the mixing between E1 and H1, a small gap [Eg in Fig. 1(b)] is generally opened, leading to bulk insulating PRL 100, 236601 (2008) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 13 JUNE 2008 0031-9007=08=100(23)=236601(4) 236601-1 © 2008 The American Physical Societybehavior.
This hybridization gap was later demonstrated in experiments [9,10].
Therefore, just like in the HgTe=CdTe QW, the inverted regime of InAs=GaSb QW should be a topologically nontrivial QSH phase protected by the bulk gap.
This simple conclusion is complicated by the unique features of type-II QW: the electron subband and hole subband are separated in two different layers.
There are several separate consequences of this fact.
First, the hy- bridization between E1 and H1 is reduced, but this is just a quantitative correction.
Second, since there is no inversion symmetry in the quantum well growth direction, SIA terms may be large enough to compete with the reduced hybrid- ization.
In addition, BIA may also play a role.
Therefore, both SIA and BIA must be included properly to make a correct prediction, while in HgTe=CdTe QW these two types of terms were ignored because BIA terms are small when compared with the gap, and the QW were symmetric which minimizes SIA.
Finally, since the electron and hole subbands lie in two different layers, there is an automatic charge transfer between the layers which yields a coex- istence of p-type and n-type carriers.
Consequently, a self- consistent treatment of Coulomb energy is necessary to account for this effect.
We will discuss all of these issues and conclude that the QSH phase exists in an experimen- tally viable parameter range.
These bulk systems have zinc-blende lattice structure and direct gaps near the  point and are thus well described by the 8-band Kane model [16].
We will construct an effective 4-band model using the same procedure as the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model [1], albeit a more complex one due to the SIA and BIA terms.
The Hamiltonian naturally separates into three parts:  H  H0  HBIA  HSIA: (1) In the basis fjE1i; jH1i; jE1i; jH1ig, and keeping terms only up to quadratic powers of k, we have  H0  kI44  Mk Ak 0 0 Ak Mk 0 0 0 0 Mk Ak 0 0 Ak Mk 0 BBB@ 1 CCCA; (2) where I44 is the 4  4 identity matrix, Mk  M0  M2k2 and k  C0  C2k2.
This is simply the Hamiltonian used by BHZ.
Two different atoms in each unit cell breaks bulk inversion symmetry and leads to additional terms [17].
When projected onto the lowest subbands the BIA terms are  HBIA  0 0 ek 0 0 0 0 hk ek 0 0 0 0 hk 0 0 0 BBB@ 1 CCCA: (3) Finally, the SIA term reads  HSIA  0 0 iek 0 0 0 0 0 iek 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 BBB@ 1 CCCA: (4) Here we recognize the SIA term as the electron k-linear Rashba term; the heavy-hole k-cubic Rashba term is ne- glected.
The parameters h, e, 0, e depend on the quantum well geometry.
Now we address the QSH phase transition.
Without HBIA and HSIA the Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is exactly a massive Dirac Hamiltonian in 2  1d.
This is the BHZ model and from their argument we know that there is a topological phase transition signaled by the gap-closing condition M0  0, and the system is in QSH phase when M0=M2 < 0.
When HBIA and HSIA terms are included, the two blocks of H0 are coupled together and the analysis does not directly apply.
However, the QSH phase is a topological phase of matter protected by the band gap [3,5,6].
If we start from the Hamiltonian H0 in the QSH phase and turn on HBIA and HSIA adiabatically, the system will remain in the QSH phase as long as the energy gap between E1 and H1 remains ﬁnite.
With realistic parameters for InAs=GaSb=AlSb QW obtained from the 8-band Kane model, the adiabatic connection between H0 and the full Hamiltonian H was veriﬁed for the proper parameter regime, which supports the existence of a QSH phase in this system.
Though the BIA and SIA terms do not destroy the QSH phase, they do modify the quantum phase transition between the QSH phase and normal insulator (NI).

A more direct way of identifying the QSH phase is to study the edge state spectrum.
There are always an odd number of Kramers’s pairs of edge states on the boundary of a QSH insulator, and an even number pairs (possibly zero) for the boundary of a NI.
The edge state energy spectrum of the effective model (1) can be obtained by solving this model with a simple tight-binding regulariza- tion in a cylindrical geometry.
The spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.
We ﬁnd one Kramers’s pair of edge states with opposite spin per edge for the QSH side, and no edge states for the NI side.
This conﬁrms the existence of QSH phase in this model.
To study InAs=GaSb=AlSb QW more systematically and quantitatively, we conﬁrm the above analysis by nu- merically solving the full 8-band Kane model.
In the inverted regime, there exists an intrinsic charge transfer between the InAs layer and GaSb layer.
Therefore, we need to take into account the built-in electric ﬁeld.
The energy dispersions for different well thicknesses are shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(c), where we ﬁx the GaSb layer thickness d1  10 nm and vary the thickness of InAs layer d2.
The system is gapped for a generic value of d2.
However, at a critical thickness d2c  9 nm [Fig. 3(b)] a crossing at ﬁnite k occurs between the subbands E1 and H1, which marks the phase transition between the QSH and NI phases.
From the above adiabatic continuity argument, we know that QW are in a NI state for d2 < d2c [Fig. 3(a)] and QSH state for d2 > d2c [Fig. 3(c)].
As the band inversion is only deter- mined by the relative positions of E1 and H1, the QW with other values of d1 behave essentially the same.
As the QSH and NI phases are always separated by a gap clos- ing, we can determine the d1-d2 phase diagram via the energy gap.
As shown in Fig. 3(d), two gapped regimes (in red) are separated by a critical line (brightly colored) in the d1-d2 plane.
The quantum well conﬁgurations shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(c) are indicated by points A, B and C, re- spectively.
Because of adiabatic continuity, an entire con- nected gapped region in the phase diagram is in the NI (QSH) phase once one point in it is conﬁrmed to be in this phase.
Since Fig. 3(a) corresponds to the NI phase and (c) the QSH phase, we identify the right side of the diagram as QSH the left side as NI.
A major advantage of InAs=GaSb=AlSb QW is that due to the large built-in electric ﬁeld, the QSH-NI phase tran- sition can be easily tuned by external gate voltages.
Tuning a gate voltage adjusts the band structure and Fermi level simultaneously.
Since the QSH effect can only occur when the Fermi level lies in the gap, we need two gates to independently tune the relative position between the E1 and H1 band edges and the Fermi level.
Such a dual-gate geometry has already been realized experimentally in InAs=GaSb=AlSb QW [11].
We performed a self- consistent Poisson-Schrodinger calculation [13–15] for such a dual-gate geometry shown in Fig. 1(a).
To simplify the calculation, we made the thickness of the AlSb barrier layers much smaller than realistic experiments.
This has a negligible effect for the QW except for a rescaling of Vf and Vb.
We also neglect the weak effects of subband anisotropy and intrinsic donor defects at the InAs=GaSb interface.
None of these simpliﬁcations should affect our results qualitatively.
For ﬁxed d1  d2  10 nm we explored the Vf-Vb phase diagram as shown in Fig. 4.
There are six distinct regions in the ﬁgure.
The dotted black line shows the phase boundary between the inverted and noninverted regimes.
In parameter regions I, II, and III the system has an inverted band structure, but only region II is in the QSH phase with a Fermi level inside the bulk gap.

Similarly region V is the NI phase and IV, VI are the corresponding p-doped and n-doped normal semiconductors.
Thus, by tuning Vf and Vb to the correct range, one can easily control the phase transition between QSH(II) and NI(V).
We highlight the direct quantum criti- cal point between the QSH(II) and NI(V) phases in Fig. 4.
Compared to a similar proposal of a gate-induced phase transition in asymmetric HgTe=CdTe QW [22], InAs= GaSb=AlSb QW are much more sensitive to the gate voltage, which makes it much easier to realize such a transition experimentally.
This is due to the fact that the electron and hole wavefunctions are centered in separate layers, so that the effect of the gate voltage on them is highly asymmetric.
This simple mechanism allows us to investigate the quantum phase transition from the NI to the QSH state in situ, through the continuous variation of the gate voltage, rather than the discrete variation of the quan- tum well thickness.
It is also useful for developing a QSH FET.
The FET is in an ‘‘OFF’’ state when the Fermi level lies inside the normal insulating gap.
Then, by adjusting the gate voltages the FET can be ﬂipped to the ‘‘ON’’ state by passing through the transition to the QSH phase, where the current is carried only by the dissipationless edge states.
This simple device can be operated with reasonable voltages as seen in Fig. 4 but would be more promising if one could enlarge the bulk insulating gap to support room temperature operation.
In conclusion, we propose that the QSH state can be realized in InAs=GaSb QW.
We presented both simple arguments based on an effective model and realistic self- consistent calculations.
We showed that this system has the distinct advantage over HgTe QW, in that the quantum phase transition can be continuously tuned by the gate voltage.
This principle could be used to construct a QSH FET device with minimal dissipation.
