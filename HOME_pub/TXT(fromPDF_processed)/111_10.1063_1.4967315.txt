Both the “collapse” regime away from the C point (q ¼ 0) and the “reinforcement” regime near C are addressed, using appropriate laser lines and Be contents.
We ﬁnd that in both regimes the consid- ered PP, in fact a transverse mode with the mixed mechanical-electrical character, obeys the same nominal Raman selection rules as its purely mechanical variant observed in the standard backscat- tering geometry.
The discussion is supported by contour modeling of the multi-PP Raman line- shapes in their q-dependence within the linear dielectric approach.

INTRODUCTION In such a polar crystal as a zincblende-type semiconduc- tor one, the transverse optic phonons due to the vibrations of the anions against the cations perpendicularly to the direction of propagation ~q are likely to be accompanied by an electri- cal ﬁeld, i.e., a transverse one, hence identical in nature to that carried by a pure transverse electrical wave, namely, a photon.1–3 The resulting transverse optic excitation with the mixed mechanical-electrical character is referred to as a phonon-polariton, abbreviated as PP hereafter.
Generally, the PP modes attract attention in view of signal processing at terahertz (phonon-like) frequencies at light-like (photon- like) speed.4 One remarkable feature of the photon-like transverse electrical ﬁeld carried by a PP mode is that it can exist only very close to the centre C (q ¼ 0) of the Brillouin zone.
The reason is that the “x vs. q” dispersion of a photon, governed by the speed of light in the crystal (scaled down from that in a vacuum, i.e., c, via the relative dielectric function er of the crystal), is quasi vertical on the q scale given by the Brillouin zone size.
Far from C, i.e., where is deﬁned the nat- ural dispersion of a photon, a transverse electrical ﬁeld can- not propagate with a consequence that a transverse optic mode reduces to a purely mechanical vibration.
In the fol- lowing, we use the classical TO notation for the latter purely mechanical variant of a transverse optic mode, the corre- sponding frequency being denoted as xT. In contrast, the electrical ﬁeld carried by a longitudinal optic (LO) mode does not suffer any restriction, because it is not photon-like.
As such, it remains non dispersive (not q-dependent), meaning that a LO mode vibrates at a ﬁxed fre- quency near C, denoted as xL. As is well-known xL > xT. This is because the effective bond force constant associated with a LO mode is enhanced by a Coulombian contribution due to the LO-like electrical ﬁeld as compared to the purely mechanical spring-like restoring force constant of a TO mode.5 The picture for PP’s propagating in the bulk of pure AB zincblende compounds is well established both theoretically and experimentally.6–8 It can be cast into a model of a single (TO, LO) oscillator.
Basically, when entering the PP regime, the transverse optic mode divides into two distinct branches.
The lower one, denoted PP, assimilates with the (purely mechanical) TO mode away from C and becomes photon- like near C well below the phonon resonance (x  xT).
As for the upper PPþ branch, this is photon-like away from C well beyond the phonon resonance (x  xT) and asymptoti- cally converges onto the xL frequency near C, being clear that one cannot distinguish between a transverse optic mode and its LO counterpart strictly at q ¼ 0.
We may retain that the xT  xL optic band remains forbidden for the propaga- tion of a PP mode in the bulk of a zincblende-type AB compound.
Little attention has comparatively been awarded to the PP’s propagating in multi-oscillator systems such as mixed crystals, the central issue in this work.
Still, alloying is potentially interesting in that it offers additional ﬂexibility besides the q value for the ﬁne tuning of the PP’s depending on applications.
Based on Maxwell’s equations, Poulet produced a generic calculation of the PP dispersion in a multi-oscillator crystal already in the seventies, which was useful to set the trend.9 Recently, Bao and Liang calculated the dispersion of a)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

120, 185702-1 JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 120, 185702 (2016)the bulk and surface PP’s of various A1-xBxC zincblende- type mixed crystals, taken either as pseudo- inﬁnite10 or con- ﬁned11 (at one or two dimensions) media.
In doing so, they assumed a basic 2-mode [1  (A-C), 1(B-C)] behavior of the (purely mechanical) TO modes from which the PP’s pro- ceed.
On the experimental side, the contributions are rather sparse.
We are only aware of the pioneering study of the sur- face PP’s of the one-mode Al1xGaxN and Al1xInxN mixed crystals with the wurtzite structure done by Ng et al.12 and Ooi et al.,13 respectively, using far-infrared attenuated total reﬂectance, and of our own recent Raman studies of the bulk PP’s of the three-mode [1  (Zn-Se), 2  (Be-Se)] Zn1xBexSe14,15 (x ¼ 0.53 and 0.33) and [1  (Zn-Se), 2  (Zn-S)] ZnSe1xSx 16,17 (x ¼ 0.22 and 0.32) zincblende- type mixed crystals.
What emerged from the above mentioned theoretical and experimental studies is that “alloying” creates an inter- mediary PPint: branch with the mixed (A-C and B-C) charac- ter between the lower PP and upper PPþ parent-like ones, now mostly related to the long/soft (say A-C) and short/stiff (B-C) bonds, respectively.
The PPint: branch differs from the PP and PPþ ones in that it exhibits a characteristic S-like “x vs. q” dispersion between the B-C (upper) and A-C (lower) spectral ranges, being governed by two asymptotic phonon frequencies and not by any photon-like one as for the PP and PPþ branches.
The asymptotic frequencies in question are, away from C, the frequency of the BC-like TO mode, and, near C, the frequency of the AC-like LO mode.
An example of such PPint: dispersion is shown, e.g., in Ref.
16 for the particular ZnSe0.68S0.32 mixed crystal (see Fig. 1 therein).
The PPint: mode is further interesting with respect to the q-dependence of its Raman intensity.
The latter is large in the two asymptotic matter/phonon-like regimes [LO-like near C, and TO-like away from C] and small in the interme- diary light/photon-like one, corresponding roughly to the inﬂexion of the S-branch.
In fact, the TO-like downfall away from C and subsequent LO-like reinforcement near C nicely come out from calculations when using our generic expres- sion of the q-dependent multi-PP Raman cross section (RCS) worked out in Ref.
14 (recalled below for clarity).
The two regimes have further been observed experimentally by Raman scattering, albeit separately, i.e., in Zn1xBexSe (originally at x ¼ 0.33—see Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. 14, and more recently at x ¼ 0.53—see Fig. 4 of Ref. 15) and in ZnSe1xSx (see Refs.
16 and 17), respectively.
For mixed crystals whose phonon behavior falls beyond the basic two-mode [1  (A-C), 1  (B-C)] description, such as the three-oscillator [1  (Zn-Se), 2  (Be-Se)] Zn1xBexSe (Ref. 18) and [1  (Zn-Se), 2  (Zn-S)] ZnSe1xSx (Ref. 17) ones, the PPint: branch duplicates.14–17 It becomes accompa- nied by a minor replica at high frequency, referred to as PPmin: hereafter.
The latter is similar in every respect to PPint:, notably in what regards the S-like shape, the double- phonon asymptotes and also the collapse and reinforcement regimes, except that its dispersion remains conﬁned within the relevant (BeSe- or ZnS-like) TO doublet.
The picture nat- urally extrapolates beyond the three-oscillator case.
Altogether, this summarizes the state of the art regarding PP’s propagating in the bulk of mixed crystals.
In this work, we aim at progressing one step further in the basic understanding of the main “alloy”-related PPint: mode by examining its Raman selection rules both in its TO- like collapse regime and in its LO-like reinforcement one, using the same A1xBxC mixed crystal for the sake of con- sistency (exploring variations in the compositions x and in the laser excitations).
We are only aware of two symmetry analysis of the PP Raman modes in the literature, done with the pure GaP7 and GaN19 compounds, and thus concerned with PP and PPþ.
As for the PPint: mode of a mixed crys- tal, its Raman selection rules remain unexplored so far.
Basically, our motivation is to elucidate whether the PPint: mode created by “alloying” near C retains the symmetry of the (purely mechanical) TO mode away from C from which it proceeds, or not, and also, whether the PP symmetry is preserved when passing on from the TO-like collapse regime FIG.

Phys. 120, 185702 (2016)to the LO-like reinforcement one, or not.20 On the experi- mental side, certain conditions have to be fulﬁlled in view to tackle such issues, concerning both the used Raman scatter- ing geometry and also the samples, as detailed below. II.
EXPERIMENT: RAMAN SCATTERING GEOMETRY AND SAMPLES Out of the two samples series at hand whose PP’s were successfully detected by Raman scattering so far, Zn1xBexSe14,15 is preferred to ZnSe1xSx 16,17 owing to the fact that in ZnSe1xSx the PPint: mode enters almost straight- away its LO-like reinforcement regime without being detect- able in the preceding TO-like collapse regime (when descending the S-like dispersion towards C).16,17 Three large-size Zn1xBexSe single crystals (cylinders, 8 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height) were grown from the melt by using the high-pressure Bridgman method, with small (x ¼ 0.12) and moderate (x ¼ 0.33) Be content and with the maximum Be content (x ¼ 0.53) achievable by this technique.
The three ingots were prepared with parallel (within less than 1) rear and front ð110Þ-oriented faces, pol- ished to optical quality.
The two samples with a large Be content are used to study the PPint: mode and the related BeSe-like signal.
The remaining sample with a large Zn con- tent is used to provide a reference insight in the ZnSe-like spectral range.
Optical spectroscopies, such as Raman scattering, are well suited to study the PP’s, because the quasi-vertical dis- persion of the laser probe places, by construction, the analysis near C.
However, the access to the PP regime is not immedi- ate for all that.
For example, in the traditional backscattering geometry (schematically operating in “reﬂection”), the scat- tering angle h between the wave vectors of the incident laser beam (~ki) and of the scattered light (~ks) is at maximum (180).
In this case, one addresses the largest achievable phonon wave vector in a Raman scattering experiment, with the magnitude of the order of a few percent of the Brillouin zone size.
This falls deep into the asymptotical regime of (purely mechanical) TO’s.6 In order to access the PP regime, the phonon wave vector has to be reduced by roughly two orders of magnitude.
This requires to adopt very small h val- ues, typically below 5, corresponding to a near-forward scat- tering geometry (schematically operating in “transmission”).6 Further, minimal q values are achieved by reducing the dis- persion of the refractive index around the used laser line (refer to Eq. (2) below).
With Zn1xBexSe, this requires large Be contents and low energy laser lines.21 The near-forward Raman selection rules were studied by focusing the incident laser beam at near-normal incidence onto the rear crystal face using a lens with large focal length (so as to minimize the angular spread of the incident laser beam, for better deﬁnition of ~ki) and by collecting the scat- tered light from the front crystal face in the same direction at a large distance (for better deﬁnition of ~ks).
Two half-wave plates were placed on each side of the sample with their neu- tral axis taken either parallel to each other or rotated by 45, corresponding to crossed (?) and parallel (k) polarizations of the incident laser beam (~ei) and of the scattered light (~es) at the sample surface, respectively.
For each conﬁguration (? or k), the half-wave plates were turned as rigid bodies over 180 with a quasi constant step of 10 so as to complete full rotations of ~ei and ~es (over 360) at the sample surface.
The angle between ~ei and the ½110 axis of the rear and front crystal faces, taken as an arbitrary reference, is referred to as the azimuth angle hereafter, denoted as a. At each a value, the scattered light was analyzed parallel to the entrance slit of the spectrometer, i.e., with a ﬁxed sensitivity of the spec- trometer—the maximum one in fact, so that the a-dependent Raman intensities are directly comparable.22 We mention that in the polarized near-forward Raman spectra, a speciﬁc coating used for the bottom half-wave plate generates a spu- rious Raman line, marked by a star in the reported data here- after.
A similar setup, but involving only one half wave plate, was used to perform the Raman selection rules in the backscattering geometry.
We recall that at normal incidence onto the ð110Þ face of a zincblende-type crystal, the LO modes are forbidden, whether using the backscattering Raman geometry or the near-forward scattering one, only the transverse optic modes are allowed.
The Raman spectra were taken with the low-energy 633.0 nm (red) and 785.0 nm (near-infrared (NIR)) laser lines from a HeNe laser and from a laser diode, respectively.
The latter operates at the detection limit of our Raman spectrome- ter, blazed for the visible.
No appreciable heating effect was detected in spite of the used illumination of 50 mW, owing to the large impact spot of the focused laser beam (20 lm in diameter—recall the large focal length), resulting in a small power density at the sample surface (10 mW/cm2). III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Theoretical insight We already know based on our pioneering Raman studies of the PP modes of Zn1xBexSe14,15 that the Zn0.67Be0.33Se and Zn0.47Be0.53 samples are well-suited to address the TO- like collapse regime of the PPint: mode.
In the following, we test theoretically whether any of the above two samples can further be used to address its LO-like reinforcement regime, that remains unexplored in Zn1xBexSe so far, depending on the exciting laser line.
For doing so, we use our generic (x; q)- dependent multi-PP (p ¼ 3 in total) Raman cross section (RCS) for a mixed crystal earlier established in Ref. 14, which we recall below for clarity RCSðx; q; xÞ  Im ( ½erðx; xÞ  q2  c2  x21  " 1 þ X p CpðxÞ  Lpðx; xÞ #2 þ X p C2 pðxÞ  x2 T;pðxÞ  Lpðx; xÞ  S1 p ðxÞ  e1 1;p  x2 T;p ) : (1) In this expression, Lpðx; xÞ ¼ x2 T;pðxÞ  ðx2 T;pðxÞ  x2  j cpðxÞ  xÞ1 represents a damped Lorentzian resonance at 185702-3 Dicko et al. J. Appl.

erðx; xÞ is the relative dielectric function of Zn1xBexSe, given in its classical form, i.e., e1ðxÞ þ P p e1;p  SpðxÞ  Lpðx; xpÞ, assuming a linear variation of e1ðxÞ. SpðxÞ and CpðxÞ are, correspondingly, the oscillator strength and the Faust-Henry coefﬁcient awarded to oscilla- tor p. SpðxÞ monitors the Raman intensity of the p-type (purely mechanical) TO mode and also the ð TO  LOÞp splitting whereas CpðxÞ governs the Raman intensity ratio between the p-type TO and LO modes.
Both SpðxÞ and CpðxÞ scale linearly with the fraction of oscillator p, i.e., as (1  x) and (x) for the unique Zn-Se oscillator and for the lower and upper Be-Se sub-oscillators taken together, respectively.
The available BeSe-like oscillator strength further shares between the latter two in proportion to the fractions of the correspond- ing Be-like (x) and Zn-like (1  x) environments.14,15,18 The related Faust-Henry coefﬁcients scale accordingly.
With this, the Raman intensities of the two BeSe-like (purely mechani- cal) TO modes of Zn0.47Be0.53Se and Zn0.67Be0.33Se, denoted as TOBe BeSe and TOZn BeSe hereafter, are expected to scale roughly in the ratios 1:1 and 1:2, respectively, as actually observed in their reference Raman spectra taken in the back- scattering geometry (see data below, and similar ones in Refs. 14 and 15).
In the compact TO notation used above, the subscript and the superscript refer to the considered bond vibration and to its Be- or Zn-like local environment, respec- tively.
Several “parent-related” input parameters are needed, in reference to the (e1; C; xT; xL) values, corresponding to (5.75, 0.7, 205cm1, 254.5 cm1) for ZnSe and to (5.32, 0.7, 450 cm1, 501 cm1) for BeSe.14 Additional “alloy”- related input parameters for Zn0.47Be0.53Se and Zn0.67Be0.33Se are the [1 (Zn-Se), 2  (Be-Se)] xT;pðxÞ Raman frequencies measured in the backscattering geometry, i.e., (224, 447, 487) and (215, 420, 466) in cm1, respectively, with corresponding phonon dampings cpðxÞ of (23, 36, 37) and (23, 38, 38), also given in cm1.
By solving numerically erðx; xÞ ¼ q2  c2  x2, which leads to the divergence of the term within brackets in Eq. (1), one can access the theoretical “x vs. q” PP disper- sion of the considered Zn1xBexSe mixed crystal.1,14 The as- obtained PP dispersion curves for Zn0.47Be0.53Se and Zn0.67Be0.33Se are displayed in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) (thin lines), respectively, with an emphasis on the PPint: (and PPmin:) mode(s) as the main interest in this work.
For more convenience, we substitute for q the dimensionless parameter y ¼ q  c  x1 1 , in which x1 arbitrarily refers to the fre- quency of the ZnSe-like (purely mechanical) TO mode.
Basically, we are interested in how far one can descend the theoretical PPint: (and also PPmin:) S-like dispersion(s) towards C by near-forward Raman scattering with a given laser line.
Generally, one retreats away from C when enlarg- ing h, whichever laser line or/and alloy composition are used (examples are given below), so that an indicative theoretical insight is obtained by calculating the PP Raman lineshapes at h ¼ 0 (thin lines) for various laser lines at hand, i.e., not only the presumably best-suited near-infrared (NIR, 785.0 nm) and red (R, 633.0 nm) ones, as discussed above, but also the more energetic green (G, 514.5 nm) and blue (B, 488.0 nm) ones from an Arþ laser.
The calculations are done by using a variant of Eq. (1) in which h substitutes for ðq; yÞ using the following correspondence (taken in the limiting case of perfect forward scattering, i.e., at h ¼ 0) q ¼ c1 	 n n2 xi; x ð Þx2 i þ n2 xs; x ð Þx2 s  2n xi; x ð Þn xs; x ð Þxixs cos h o1 2 ; (2) as derived from the wave vector conservation law governing the Raman scattering.
The dependence on the exciting laser line is contained in n(xi,x) and n(xs,x), corresponding to the refractive indexes of Zn1xBexSe at the frequencies of the incident laser beam (xi) and of the scattered light (xs).
The wavelength (k) dependencies of the refractive indexes of our two Zn1xBexSe crystals in the visible spectral range, which we measured by ellipsometry, were ﬁtted to the Cauchy dispersion formula nðkÞ ¼ X þ Y  k2  104 þ Z  k4  109; (3) using (X,Y, and Z) values of (2.3767 6 0.0015, 2.0873 6 0.0792, and 3.1818 6 0.0916) for x ¼ 0.53 (Ref. 15) and of (2.4187 6 0.0003, 2.2111 6 0.0225, and 4.9053 6 0.0317) for x ¼ 0.33 (measured in this work, whereas in Ref.
14 we used extrapolated values from Ref. 21), where X is dimen- sionless, Y and Z are constants with units of nm2 and nm4, respectively, and k is in nm.
The resulting RCSðx; h ¼ 0; xÞ PPint: (and also PPmin:) Raman lineshapes for Zn0.47Be0.63Se and Zn0.67Be0.33Se, together with the reference RCSðx; h ¼ 180; xÞ from their native (purely mechanical) TOBe BeSe and TOZn BeSe modes (emphasized in grey) and also the RCSðx; q ¼ 0; xÞ from the related LO BeSe and LOþ BeSe ones (dashed lines), are dis- played in Fig. 1.
In each case, a small phonon damping cpðxÞ of 1 cm1 is used, for clarity.
The “Raman intensity vs. Raman frequency” dependencies of the PPint: modes accessi- ble for both alloys with the used laser excitations (dashed- dotted curves) are useful to complete the theoretical insight.
The theoretical TO-like collapse regime of the PPint: mode covers a large spectral range in the case of Zn0.47Be0.53Se—as observed experimentally in Ref.
15, i.e., roughly double that predicted for Zn0.67Be0.33Se.
Therefore, the former alloy seems optimal in view to explore the PPint: Raman selection rules in the TO-like collapse regime.
A suitable laser line for doing so appears to be the red one that covers the latter regime in full, i.e., beyond the PPint: extinction, with both alloys.
In contrast, the most energetic blue and green laser lines fail to achieve the PPint: extinction, in any alloy.
On the other hand, the red line does not enter frankly inside the LO-like reinforcement regime, at least in the case of Zn0.37Be0.33Se.
The only successful exci- tation with this respect, for both crystals, is the near-infrared (785.0 nm) one, thus emerging as the most relevant laser line in view to access experimentally the PPint: mode of Zn1xBexSe in its LO-like reinforcement regime.
B. Raman selection rules in the near-forward scattering geometry In Fig. 2, we display the reference unpolarized Raman spectra of our three (110)-oriented Zn1xBexSe samples 185702-4 Dicko et al. J. Appl.
Phys. 120, 185702 (2016)taken in the standard backscattering geometry (h  180, the- oretical peaks emphasized in dark grey in Fig. 1) using the 633.0 nm laser line.
The reported Zn1xBexSe spectra may seem redundant with similar ones already shown in Refs.
14 (x ¼ 0.33) and 15 (x ¼ 0.53).
However, these constitute an obliged reference prior to the forthcoming discussion of the phonon-polariton data taken in the near-forward scattering geometry (h  0).
We recall that in the backscattering geometry, one falls deep into the asymptotic regime of purely mechanical (TOZnSe, TOBe BeSe; TOZn BeSe) modes.
The latter modes emerge near 210 cm1, 425 cm1, and 500 cm1, with slight varia- tions depending on the Be content (see detail in Sec. III A).
The latter TO’s are ﬂanked on their high frequency side, i.e., around 240 cm1, 430 cm1, 525 cm1, by their LOZnSe, LO BeSe (not observed, being screened by the purely mechani- cal BeSe-like TO’s), and LOþ BeSe counterparts, respectively.
The LO features are theoretically forbidden but activated as minor peaks due to a disorder-induced breaking of the wave vector conservation law, a common feature in mixed crystals.
The LO activation is also due to the multi-reﬂection of the laser beam in between the parallel rear and front crystal faces.
Indeed our Zn1xBexSe alloys exhibit large optical band gaps inherited from their parent ZnSe (2.5 eV) and BeSe (5.5 eV) compounds,23 and thus are transparent to the (visible) laser beam.
In fact, the LO’s reinforce when using the less energetic 785.0 nm laser line that penetrates more into the crystal (a direct insight in the case of Zn0.67Be0.33Se is given in Fig. 4), thus more prone to multi-reﬂection.
Alternative peaks/bands notably visible around 200 and 325 cm1 reﬂect maxima in the one-phonon (disorder-activated, abbreviated DA) and two- phonon (allowed) density of states involving the transverse (TA) and/or longitudinal (LA) acoustic modes.
Among these modes, the so-called X band, emerging roughly halfway the Zn-Se and Be-Se spectral ranges, plays an important role in the following discussion.
Based on recent measurements of the Zn0.67Be0.33Se phonon dispersion by inelastic neutron scattering and on related ab initio calculations,24 the X band is tentatively identiﬁed as the two-phonon TA þ LA band from the X zone-edge.
Now, we turn to the near-forward Raman data.
In this geometry also, the multi-reﬂection of the laser beam magni- ﬁes the LO modes, especially at near-normal incidence (h  0).3 More importantly, on its way back to the rear crystal face, the laser beam generates a spurious backscattering sig- nal, which superimposes on the nominal PP one created by the laser beam on its way forth to the front crystal face.
As a consequence, the PPmin: mode, which falls into the TOBe BeSe  TOZn BeSe band of purely mechanical modes (see Fig. 1), is screened.
Only the PPint: mode is visible.
Our concern in the following is to identify possible PPint: candidates on which to realize the Raman selection rules both in the TO-like collapse regime and in the LO-like reinforcement one.
In Ref. 15 (see Fig. 4 therein), the TO-like collapse regime of the PPint: mode of Zn0.47Be0.53Se could be sequenced into a detailed series of Raman spectra taken with crossed incident-scattered polarizations at various scattering angles h by using the red (633.0 nm) laser line, until quasi PPint: extinction at vanishingly small angle (h  0).
From the data reported therein, the most suitable scattering angle for the planned near-forward Raman selection rules in the pre- sent work appears to be a small but ﬁnite one around 0.8.
At this limit, the PPint: mode is probed approximately halfway to its collapse regime (at 400 cm1), where it remains reason- ably strong and at the same time well separated from both the spurious BeSe-like backscattering signal and the X band.
A direct insight is given in Fig. 2 (upper truncated spectrum).
Such PPint: mode is ideal for performing the Raman selection rules in the TO-like collapse regime.
Contrary to expectations (referring to Fig. 1(a)), the 785.0 nm laser line fails to reveal the PPint: mode of Zn0.47Be0.53Se in its LO-like reinforcement regime.
We attri- bute this to the X band that overlaps onto the spectral range in which the LO-like reinforcement regime in this alloy starts (see Fig. 1(a)).
This gives rise to an anharmonic decay of the reinforced PPint: mode as soon as it emerges.
In Zn0.67Be0.33Se, the LO-like reinforcement regime of the PPint: mode starts at a higher frequency (see Fig. 1(b)) so that the PPint: mode is successfully detected with the 785.0 nm excita- tion.
In fact, at vanishingly small scattering angle (h  0), a distinct PPint: feature shows up, emerging strong and sharp at intermediary frequency between the X band and the spurious FIG.

Such PPint: mode is a choice candidate for studying the Raman selection rules in the LO-like reinforcement regime.
A representative spectrum, recorded by using parallel incident-scattered polar- izations at a  180 (an extended a-series is shown below) so as to minimize the spurious LO signal activated by multi- reﬂection of the laser beam, is shown in Fig. 2 (lower trun- cated spectrum).
The integrated Raman intensities of the above two selected PPint: modes in the TO-like collapse regime of Zn0.47Be0.53Se and in the LO-like reinforcement regime of Zn0.67Be0.33Se were estimated via a careful contour model- ing using Lorentzian/Gaussian functions (examples are given in Fig. 2, emphasized in light grey) in their dependence on the azimuth angle a, in crossed (?, open symbols) and paral- lel (k, ﬁlled symbols) incident-scattered polarizations, at the same sample spot.
The light scattering geometry is shown in Fig. 3(a).
The resulting patterns, with characteristic cross- like (?) and butterﬂy-like (k) shapes, are shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively.
The data therein are normalized to the area of the most intense PPint: peak out of the ?-type a-series, taken as an arbitrary reference.
As such, they have no unit.
Reasonable repeatability is achieved over a complete a-revolution (over 360, refer to the large arrows in Fig. 3), indicating that the laser power remained stable during the measurements.
The experimental cross-like (?) and butterﬂy-like (k) patterns compare fairly well with the corresponding theoreti- cal ones (?-thin and k-thick lines) calculated by expressing the Raman tensors of our zincblende crystals in the relevant { 1ﬃﬃ 2 p 110 ½ , 1ﬃﬃ 2 p 110; 001 ½    basis for a near-normal incidence onto the (110) crystal face.
We conclude that the PPint: mode, whether taken in its TO-like collapse regime or in its LO-like reinforcement one, obeys the same nominal Raman selection rules as observed in the traditional backscattering geometry with the native (purely mechanical) TO modes (see Fig. 5, the Appendix).
For a direct insight, we compare in Fig. 4 two series of Zn0.67Be0.33Se Raman spectra taken at the same sample spot (different from that used to create Fig. 3) in parallel incident-scattered polarizations (k) at corresponding a angles covering roughly half a period of the butterﬂy-like pattern, both in the standard backscattering geometry (h  180, thin curves) and in the near-perfect forward scattering one (h  0, thick curves), using the 633.0 nm and 785.0 nm laser lines, respectively.
As expected, the disorder-activated (DA) TA and LA bands at low frequency (70–190 cm1) remain nearly a-insensitive, in both geometries.
Surprisingly, this is not valid for the theoretically forbidden LOZnSe and LOþ BeSe modes that are activated both by the alloy disorder and by the multi-reﬂection of the laser beam at near-normal incidence.
Clear LO Raman selection rules are observed in both geometries, with the periodical alternation of complete extinc- tion (a  90, 180, 270) and strong emergence (a  130, 230).
As expected, the allowed PPint: mode of Zn0.67Be0.33Se also obeys distinct Raman selection rules.
However, these strongly deviate from the LO ones.
In fact, the PPint: mode exhibits the same Raman selection rules as its native purely mechanical TOBe BeSe and TOZn BeSe modes (h180, thin curves), characterized by two extinctions (at a  90, 270) over the considered a-domain (and not three as for the LO’s).
In fact, the similarity between the Raman selection rules of the PPint: mode and of its native purely mechanical TOBe BeSe and TOZn BeSe modes must not be surprising since ~u, the relative displacement of the cationic and anionic species characteristic of an optic mode, as well as its accompanying electrical ﬁeld ~E, which, taken together, govern the Raman scattering due to the (purely mechanical) TO’s (~u), PP’s [~u, ~E(~q)], and LO’s (~u, ~E), do both consist of ﬁrst-rank tensors (vectors).
The Raman tensors, which reveal the modulation of the electronic susceptibility by ~u and/or ~E, thus keep the same form for all these modes (see, e.g., Ref. 3, p. 380), with concomitant impact on the Raman selection rules, being the same.
Note that the PPint: mode of Zn0.67Be0.33Se used to per- form the Raman selection rules in the LO-like reinforcement regime is shifted to lower frequency by as much as 17 cm1 with respect to the PPint: curve calculated at h  0 for the used 785.0 nm excitation (see Fig. 1, the FIG. 3.

Using a similar approach as in Ref. 18, we have checked (not shown) that a discrete ﬁne structuring of the (purely mechan- ical) TOBe BeSe and TOZn BeSe modes sufﬁces to explain such apparent anomaly between the experimental and theoretical PPint: frequencies, at least qualitatively.
A more detailed dis- cussion falls beyond the scope of this work.
IV. CONCLUSION We perform the near-forward Raman selection rules of the PPint: mode created by “alloying” in the three-mode [1  (Zn-Se), 2  (Be-Se)] Zn1xBexSe system, using paral- lel and crossed incident-scattered polarizations.
We ﬁnd that the PPint: mode keeps the nominal symmetry of a transverse optic mode as apparent in the standard backscattering geom- etry throughout the whole of its characteristic S-like disper- sion, i.e., not only in its TO-like collapse regime away from C but also in its LO-like reinforcement regime near C. Optimal Raman insight into a given PP regime is achieved by adjusting the Be content, the laser excitation and the PP wave vector (via the scattering angle h), supported by con- tour modeling of the PP Raman lineshapes in their (x, q, h) dependencies within the linear dielectric approach.

APPENDIX: REFERENCE BACKWARD RAMAN SELECTION RULES In this section, we provide a reference insight into the Raman selection rules obeyed by the (purely mechanical) TO modes of Zn1xBexSe in the traditional backscattering geometry, using the 633.0 nm laser line.
The light scattering geometry is basically the same as that shown in Fig. 3(a).
Only, the directions of the incident laser beam (~ki) and of the scattered light (~ks) are now opposite.
The corresponding data for the ZnSe-like TO mode of Zn0.88Be0.12Se (a) and for the (TOBe BeSe; TOZn BeSe) doublet of Zn0.47Be0.53Se (b) are reported in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively.
The used crystals corre- spond to the large Zn content and maximum Be content, respectively, and are thus well suited for such reference Zn- Se and Be-Se insights.
The Raman intensities were measured in their angular (a, see main text) dependence in a given polarization setup (? or k) via a careful contour modeling using Lorentzian/Gaussian functions (refer to the Raman fea- tures emphasized in dark grey in Fig. 2).
The Be-Se contour modeling was performed directly on the raw spectra owing to the naturally well-deﬁned baseline in this spectral range.
In contrast, the ZnSe-like TO mode is contaminated by FIG. 4.

185702-7 Dicko et al. J. Appl.
Phys. 120, 185702 (2016)numerous disorder-induced features, so that the subtraction of a tentative baseline (refer to the dotted curve in Fig. 2) was required before Lorentzian-like adjustment.
The experimental data basically conform to the theoreti- cal predictions (plain curves, see main text), in both the ?
(cross-like, theory—thick lines, exp.—open symbols) and k (butterﬂy-like, theory—thin lines, exp.—ﬁlled symbols) polarization setups.
In fact, the agreement is nearly perfect in the case of Be-Se, with both the TOBe BeSe (circles) and TOZn BeSe (triangles) features.
Similar butterﬂy- and cross-like patterns are also observed with the TOZnSe mode, but the agreement between theory and experiment is not as good, especially when the TOZnSe mode is close to extinction.
This is due to the above mentioned contamination problem, which prevents a reliable determination of the Raman inten- sity at critical a angles.
The as-obtained Raman selection rules for the purely mechanical (TOZnSe, TOBe BeSe, TOZn BeSe) modes (~E ¼ ~0) of Zn1xBexSe achieved in the backscattering geometry consti- tute natural references for the given discussion, in the main part of the manuscript (Sec.
III B), of the like PPint: (~ET equipped) Raman selection rules done in the TO-like col- lapse regime and in the LO-like reinforcement one by near- forward scattering.
