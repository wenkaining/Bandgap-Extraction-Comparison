Anomalous Behavior of the CoefÔ¨Åcient of Normal Restitution in Oblique Impact Hiroto Kuninaka1,* and Hisao Hayakawa2 1Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan, 606-8501 2Department of Physics, Yoshida-south campus, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan, 606-8501 (Received 3 October 2003; published 5 October 2004) The coefÔ¨Åcient of normal restitution in an oblique impact is theoretically studied.
Using a two- dimensional lattice model for an elastic disk and an elastic wall, we demonstrate that the coefÔ¨Åcient of normal restitution can exceed unity and has a peak against the incident angle in our simulation.
We also explain this behavior based upon a phenomenological theory.

The coefÔ¨Åcient e is deÔ¨Åned by v c  n  ev0  n; (1) where v is the relative velocity of the centers of mass of two colliding materials at time  measured from the initial contact, c is the duration of a collision, and n is the unit vector normal to the contact plane.
Though some text books of elementary physics state that e is a material constant, many experiments and simulations show that e decreases with increasing impact velocity [1].
The depen- dence of e on the low impact velocity is theoretically treated by the quasistatic theory [2‚Äì4].We also recognize that e can be less than unity for the normal impact without the introduction of any explicit dissipation, be- cause the macroscopic inelasticities originate in the trans- fer of the energy from the translational mode to the internal modes such as the vibrations [3,5,6].
While e has been believed to be less than unity in most situations, it is recently reported that e can exceed unity in oblique impacts [7‚Äì9].
In particular, Louge and Adams [9] observed oblique impacts of a hard aluminum oxide sphere on a thick elastoplastic polycarbonate plate and found that e grows monotonically with the magnitude of the tangent of the incident angle . In their experiment, Young‚Äôs modulus of the plate is 100 times smaller than that of the aluminum oxide sphere.
They also suggested that e can exceed unity for the most oblique impacts.
In this Letter, we demonstrate that our two- dimensional simulation of the oblique impact based on Hamilton‚Äôs equation has yielded an increasing e with tan and e exceeds unity at the critical incident angle.
Finally, we explain our results by our phenomenological theory.
Let us introduce our numerical model [10].
Our model consists of an elastic disk and an elastic wall (Fig. 1).
The width and the height of the wall are 8R and 2R, respec- tively, where R is the mean radius of the undeformed disk.
Both side ends and the bottom of the wall are Ô¨Åxed.
We place 800 mass points at random in a disk with the radius R and 4000 mass points at random in a wall for the disk and the wall, respectively.
We connect each mass point with its neighbor mass points by the Delaunay triangu- lation algorithm [11], and undeformed nonlinear springs are placed on all the connections.
Each mass point i on the lower half boundary of the disk feels the force, Fli s   aV0 expali s ni s , where li s is the distance between the ith surface mass point of the disk and the nearest surface spring of the wall, a  300=R, V0  amc2R=2, m is the mass of each mass point, c is the one-dimensional velocity of sound, and ni s is the unit vector normal to the connection between two surface mass points of the wall [10].
We should note that the strong repulsion Fli s  is introduced to inhibit the pene- tration of the disk to the surface of the wall [5].
Thus, the dynamical equation of motion for each mass point i of the lower half boundary of the disk is described by m d2ri d2  X Ni j1 fkaxij  kbx3 ijg   lth  li s aV0 expali s ni s ; (2) where ri is the position of ith mass point, Ni is the number of mass points connected to the ith mass point, xij is the Œ≥ FIG. 1.
The elastic disk and wall consisted of random lattice.

Here we introduce the step function  x, i.e.,  x  1 for x   0 and  x  0 for x < 0, and the threshold length lth which is the average of the natural lengths of the springs of the disk.
For internal mass points, the last term of the right hand side of Eq. (2) is omitted.
In most of our simulations, we adopt ka  kd a  1:0 	 mc2=R2 for the disk and ka  kw a  1:0 	 102mc2=R2 for the wall.
We do not introduce any dissipative mechanism in this model.
Thus, during a collision, a part of the initial translational energy of the disk is distributed into the vibrational energy of the disk and the wall.
It should be noted that the macroscopic dissipation can be interpreted as the irreversible transfer of the energy from the translational motion to the internal vibration.
When we introduce explicit dissipations in the model and add the gravity to the disk, we have conÔ¨Årmed that the compression of the disk can be described by two- dimensional Hertzian contact theory [12].
In this model, the roughness of the surfaces is impor- tant to make the disk rotate after a collision [10].
We modify the positions of the surface mass points of the Ô¨Çat wall and the smooth disk by using normal random num- bers whose average and standard deviation are 0 and 3 	 102R, respectively.
Poisson‚Äôs ratio  and Young‚Äôs modulus E of this model can be evaluated by adding the external force to stretch the rectangle of random lattice numerically.
We obtain Poisson‚Äôs ratio   7:50  0:11 	 102 and Young‚Äôs modulus E  9:54  0:231 	 103mc2=R2, respectively [10].
We solve the dynamical equation of motion (2) for each mass point with the initial speed jv0j  0:1c and the incident angle , and determine e for each  according to Eq. (1).
All the results in this Letter are obtained by averaging the results of 100 disks with different conÔ¨Ågu- rations of mass points.
We use the fourth order symplectic integrator with the time step   103R=c. Figure 2 is the relation between e and 1   v0  t=v0  n  tan, where t is the unit vector vertical to n.
The cross point is the mean value and the error bar is the standard deviation of 100 samples for each . This result shows that e increases with increasing 1 to exceed unity, and has a peak around 1  6:0.
The behavior of e having the peak is in contrast to that in the experiment by Louge and Adams [9].
Here, let us explain our results.
Louge and Adams [9] suggest that their results can be explained by the rotation of the normal unit vector n arising from the local defor- mation of the wall‚Äôs surface.
Thus, we aim to determine the angle of rotation of the unit vector  at each  from the theory of elasticity.

(4) and (5), we obtain the relation between 1 and tan.
Next, let us calculate e from the relation between 1 and tan. We introduce the rotated unit vectors, n and t, as n  cosn  sint and t  sinn  cost, re- spectively.
By introducing e   vc  n=v0  n, we can express e in terms of e as e  e   2 tan 1   1 tan ; (6) where  1  v0  t=v0  n and  2  vc  t=v0  n.  1 also can be rewritten as  1  1  tan=1  1 tan: (7) On the other hand, in the oblique impact of slipping disks,  2 is given by  2   1  31  e  (8) in the two-dimensional situation [14].
In Eq. (8),  , deÔ¨Åned by    jJ  tj=jJ  nj, is given by      tan 1   tan : (9) To draw the solid line in Fig. 2, at Ô¨Årst, we calculate  and tan for each 1.
By choosing a Ô¨Åtting parameter e  0:95 and substituting Eqs.
(7)‚Äì(9) into Eq. (6) we obtain e as a function of ,  , and 1.
All points are interpolated with the cubic spline interpolation method to draw the solid curve.
This theoretical description of e is qualita- tively consistent with our numerical result, though the theoretical value is a little smaller than the observed value.
Now, let us consider how  depends on 1 based on a phenomenological argument.
For simplicity, we replace the roughness on the surface of the wall by a periodic array of asperities.
When the disk hits one asperity, a fraction of the energy is absorbed in the wall.
We assume that the tangential velocity vi1 t changes to vi t  1  % vi1 t when the disk hits the ith asperity.
Thus, if the disk contacts N asperities during the impact, the tangen- tial speed at the release point becomes vtc  vN t  1  %Nvt0.
Here we estimate the number of contacted asperities during the collision as N  &lsl, where & is the number of the asperities in a unit length on the surface and lsl is the length of sliding which can be evaluated as lsl  vt0c with c  R=c  ln4c=vn0 p [6].
Thus, the tangential impulse Jt   J  t is approximated by Jt  Mf1  %&lsl  1gvt0 ‚Äô %M&lslvt0; (10) where we assume small %.
Now, we should answer the question how to determine %.When the impact velocity is large enough, % becomes smaller because the asperities are broken down when the disk hits them.
Therefore we may assume the form %  %0=1  ) v2t 0=v2n0  %0=1  ) 2 1 with the introduction of the dimensionless parameters %0 and ).
Taking into account Jn   J  n  M1  evn0 and the deÔ¨Ånition of   Jt=Jn, we obtain   % 0&R 1  e 1 1  )2 1  2 1 1  2 1 ln40  1  2 1 q  s jv0j c : (11) Here we use cos   1=1  2 1 q , sin   2 1=1  2 1 q .
We adopt the numerical results for the value of e at each 1 (Fig. 2) and jv0j=c  0:1.
The solid curve in Fig. 4 is Eq. (11) with Ô¨Åtting parameters )  0:21 and %0&R  0:18, which reproduces our nu- merical result.
We do not claim that our simple argument explains the experimental result because of two Ô¨Åtting parameters.
However, we emphasize that our picture cap- tures the essence of the behavior of  in the oblique impact.
Let us discuss our result.
First, we emphasize that the novel phenomena of e exceeding unity are obtained from the local deformation of the soft wall for the oblique impacts of a hard disk.
When we simulate the impact between a disk and a hard wall, for kw a  10 	 kd a , e Ô¨Çuctuates around a constant to exceed unity abruptly around 1  4:5 [12].
This tendency resembles the ex- perimental results by Calsamiglia et al. [8].
Thus, for a smooth increase of e to exceed unity, the wall should be softer than the disk.
In addition, it is important to Ô¨Åx the initial kinetic energy of the disk.
So far, we have con- Ô¨Årmed that e does not exceed unity when 1 is controlled by changing vt with Ô¨Åxed vn [10].
Second, the initial velocity of the disk and the local deformation of the wall are much larger than those in the experimental ones in Ref. [9].

VOLUME 93, NUMBER 15 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 8 OCTOBER 2004 154301-3 154301-3niÔ¨Åcant difference between our result and their result [9].
Because of the high speed impact in our case, there is a peak of e for small . In fact, our simulation with jv0j  0:01c shows the shift of the peak for larger . Therefore, we expect that our model reproduces the result of Ref.
[9] for the low impact speed.
In addition, we have carried out simulations with a disk of 400 mass points and a wall of 2000 mass points to check the effect of the system size.
Although there is a slight difference between the results, the data are also well reproducible by our phenomeno- logical theory.
Third, the local deformation of the wall also affects the relation between  and 1.
In early studies, it has been shown that  depends on the impact velocity [9,15].
In our simulation,  has a peak around 1  3:0.
This behavior is interpreted as that the asperities are Ô¨Çattened for large vt.
Equation (11) indicates that  can increase with increasing  as in Ref.
[9] if we choose a suitable set of ) and %0&.
The difference between the results of their experiment and our simulation may be explained by the choice of these parameters.
Fourth, we adopt the static theory of elasticity to ex- plain our numerical results in this Letter.
However, it is important to solve the time-dependent equation of the deformation of the wall‚Äôs surface to analyze the dynamics of impact phenomena.
The dynamical analysis will be our future task.
Finally, we indicate that the friction coefÔ¨Åcient is de- rived from our Hamiltonian model.
This friction comes from the irreversible energy transfer of the macroscopic translational motion to the internal vibration.
The irre- versibility is indeed related to the second law of thermo- dynamics if the number of the internal degrees of freedom is inÔ¨Ånite.
However, the irreversibility in our system which includes only 103 mass points in a disk is incomplete as we can see that the Hertzian contact theory cannot be recovered without introduction of the explicit dissipation.
We believe that the complete treatment of the inelastic collision of macroscopic materials without in- troduction of dissipations will be a fundamental subject of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
In summary, we have carried out the two-dimensional simulation of the oblique impact of an elastic disk on an elastic wall.
We have found that e can exceed unity in the oblique impact, which is attributed to the local deforma- tion of the wall.
We have estimated the magnitude of the local deformation  based on the static theory of elastic- ity and derived the relation between e and 1 by taking into account the rotation of the normal unit vector of the wall‚Äôs surface.
The relation between  and 1 is also related to the local deformation and is explained by the simple argument.
