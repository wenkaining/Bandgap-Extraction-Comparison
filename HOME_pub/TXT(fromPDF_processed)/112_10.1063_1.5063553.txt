An ANE voltage is observed for [Fe3O4/Pt]n mul- tilayers, and we further investigated its origin by performing measurements in [Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayers as a function of the Pt thickness.
Our results suggest the presence of an interface-induced ANE in the metallic layer, possibly driven by a heat induced subnanometer interdif- fusion which affects the nature of the Fe3O4/Pt interface.
Despite this ANE, the spin Seebeck effect is the dominant mechanism for the trans- verse thermoelectric voltage in the in-plane magnetized conﬁguration, accounting for about 70% of the voltage in the multilayers.

https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5063553 Thermoelectricity deals with the study of heat-to-electricity inter- conversion processes, having the potential for the development of waste heat energy-harvesting technologies.
Since the discovery of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE),1,2 a new heat-to-electricity conversion para- digm in magnetic systems was established and has been extensively studied in a wide range of materials.3,4 This invigorated the ﬁeld of spin caloritronics,5,6 which studies the interaction between heat, elec- tron, and spin currents.
In the SSE, a spin current7 is generally created in a ferromagnetic material (F) upon application of a temperature gra- dient and electrically detected in an adjacent normal metal (N) by the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE).8 The presence of the SSE in magnetic insulators2 has potential advantages over conventional thermoelectrics due to lower heat dis- sipation losses.
Its experimental geometry, with the thermal and electric current paths perpendicular to each other, is also advanta- geous for the implementation of thin ﬁlms and ﬂexible thermoelec- tric devices.9,10 However, the low magnitude of the measured voltage is an obstacle for the development of potential SSE applica- tions.
In this regard, different possibilities are currently being explored,4 such as increasing the spin current detection efﬁ- ciency,11,12 spin Hall thermopiles,13 [F/N]n multilayers,14–22 or bulk composite systems.23 Appl. Phys. Lett.
114, 113902 (2019); doi: 10.1063/1.5063553 114, 113902-1 Published under license by AIP Publishing Applied Physics Letters ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/aplThe ISHE-induced electric ﬁeld, driven by the thermally gener- ated spin currents in the SSE, can be written as EISHE ¼ hSHqðJS  rÞ; (1) where hSH and q denote the spin Hall angle and electric resistivity of N, respectively.
EISHE, JS, and r are the ISHE generated electric ﬁeld, spatial direction of spin current (perpendicular to the F/N interface), and spin-polarization vector (parallel to the magnetization, M).
The geometry for the detection of the ISHE is similar to that of the ANE in electrically conductive ferromagnets, which is described by the follow- ing expression:24 EANE ¼ QSl0ðrT  MÞ; (2) where QS, l0, rT, and EANE are the ANE coefﬁcient, vacuum perme- ability, applied thermal gradient, and ANE-induced electric ﬁeld, respectively.
Therefore, when using ferromagnetic metals, care must be taken in order to separate the contribution of the SSE from that of the ANE.25,26 In the case of Fe3O4/Pt, the ANE contribution from Fe3O4 is expected to be negligibly small due to the resistivity of Fe3O4 being two orders of magnitude larger than that of Pt.27 Another source of the ANE-driven electric ﬁeld can be due to a possible magnetic proximity effect (MPE) at the Fe3O4/Pt interface.
In the case of YIG/Pt and other insulating ferrimagnetic oxides, studies based on x-ray techniques [X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray resonant magnetic reﬂectivity (XRMR)] have shown a negligible small MPE;28–31 in contrast, Lu et al.32 have reported a non-negligible MPE on a magnetic insulator/Pt system although the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.
Recently, XMCD measurements in a Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4 trilayer grown at high tempera- ture33 have shown a large induced magnetic moment in the Pt inter- layer, and therefore, investigating its effect on the thermally driven magnetotransport properties26 is important to gain further insight into the heat-to-electricity conversion process in [Fe3O4/Pt]-based hetero- structures.
To this purpose, we have performed measurements of the longitudinal SSE,34 with an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld (IM) [Fig. 1(a)], and the ANE with a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular to the sam- ple surface (PM) [Fig. 1(c)].
The measurements in the PM conﬁgura- tion provide a direct measurement of the ANE in the F/N heterostructures due to the fact that, in this conﬁguration, any injected spin current is parallel to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld H (JS k H k z) and EISHE ¼ 0 due to the ISHE geometry [Eq. (1)].3,35 Here, we have studied two types of Fe3O4/Pt-based heterostruc- tures: [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers (these are the same samples used in our previous studies)14–16,20,21 and [Fe3O4/Pt(tPt)/Fe3O4] trilayers with nominal Pt thicknesses ranging from 1 to 40 nm.
The Fe3O4 ﬁlms were grown on MgO(001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (UHV).
The Pt ﬁlms were sequentially deposited by DC magnetron sputtering in the same UHV chamber.
The substrate temperature during the entire thin ﬁlm growth process was kept at 480 C. The structural quality of the samples was con- ﬁrmed by x-ray diffraction and high angle annular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM); detailed information about sample preparation and characterization can be found elsewhere.14 For the thermoelectric measurements, we employ the temperature difference (DT) method34,36 (supplementary material) and a constant heat power is applied to sustain a similar DT for all the samples in each conﬁguration and to minimise thermal contact resistance errors; other possibility to avoid these is the heat ﬂux method;37–39 however, it is more sensitive to heat leakages.
Figures 1(b) and 1(d) show the results of the transverse thermo- electric voltage for the [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers in the IM [Fig. 1(a)] and PM [Fig. 1(c)] conﬁgurations, respectively.
The voltage measured in the IM conﬁguration is more than one order of magnitude larger than that observed in the PM conﬁguration.
However, to quantitatively compare these voltages, we need to know the temperature gradient distribution in the sample.
In the PM conﬁguration, both the multilayer and the sub- strate are subjected to the same thermal gradient since they are in direct contact with the heat conducting AlN plates (see supplementary mate- rial).
However, in the IM conﬁguration, we need to evaluate the thermal gradient distribution across the thickness direction (k z).
By considering heat conservation across the direction of applied heat current, we can estimate that the ANE in the [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers accounts for about 30% of the measured voltage in the IM conﬁguration (supplementary material), indicating that there is a non-negligible contribution from the spin-polarized conduction electrons to the transverse thermoelectric voltage, although smaller than the SSE voltage.
In order to gain further insight into the nature of the ANE contri- bution, we systematically measured the transverse thermoelectric voltage in [Fe3O4/Pt(tPt)/Fe3O4] trilayers with different platinum thicknesses, tPt.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the voltages measured in the IM and PM conﬁgurations, respectively.
As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), the voltage in the IM conﬁguration continuously increases as the Pt thickness decreases with a maximum at 3 nm and then rapidly decreases, in agreement with that previously reported in a YIG/Pt sys- tem.40 In contrast, the ANE-induced thermoelectric voltage in the PM conﬁguration shows a monotonic increase in the magnitude as the Pt thickness decreases [inset of Fig. 2(b)].

114, 113902 (2019); doi: 10.1063/1.5063553 114, 113902-2 Published under license by AIP PublishingThe observed ANE can originate from the ANE of Fe3O4 24 or the presence of a magnetic interlayer at the Fe3O4/Pt interface.
Under the ﬁrst scenario, the observed ANE voltage is expected to be strongly sup- pressed below the metal-insulator transition [Verwey transition, TV 110 K for these ﬁlms, see the inset of Fig. 2(c)].
This is due to the even larger resistivity of Fe3O4 and the increased shunting effect by the Pt layer.
However, the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric voltage in the PM conﬁguration [Fig. 2(c)] shows a non-negligible voltage even at temperatures lower than TV, suggesting that the ANE signal might be originated in the metallic layer at the Fe3O4/Pt interface.
Let us now focus on the thickness dependence of the ANE volt- age measured in the PM conﬁguration at room temperature.
To ana- lyze the result, we consider an equivalent circuit model in which a magnetic interlayer of thickness tMP is included at the Fe3O4/Pt inter- faces [Fig. 3(a)].
This model describes the two previous scenarios where the ANE can originate from the Fe3O4 ﬁlm (EF) and in the interface region (EMP).
The resultant electric ﬁeld in the non-magnetic Pt layer (Ey) is expressed as Ey ¼ 1 1 þ qFqMPðtPt  2tMPÞ 2qPtðtFqMP þ tMPqFÞ tFqMPEF þ tMPqFEMP tFqMP þ tMPqF   ; (3) where qF (qMP, qPt) and tF (tMP, tPt) represent the resistivity and the thickness of the Fe3O4 (MPE, Pt) layer, respectively.
We consider qF ¼ 6.96  10–5 Xm14 and qMP ¼ qPt (since they represent the mag- netic and non-magnetic parts of the Pt layer).
The thickness depen- dence of the Pt resistivity in the trilayers with tPt > 3 nm [Fig. 3(b)] is well described by conventional electron transport in metals,41,42 and this needs to be considered (supplementary material) to include the thickness dependence of the ANE into our model [Eq. (3)].
In Eq. (3), all the parameters are known, except for EMP and tMP.
We can esti- mate the value of EMP using the model proposed by Guo et al.,43 where they theoretically estimated the ANE in a magnetized Pt as a function of the induced spin magnetic moment (mS).
With their estimation and the value of mS ¼ 0.34 6 0.04 lB for Pt recently measured by XMCD in a Fe3O4/Pt(2 nm)/Fe3O4 trilayer by Kikkawa et al.,33 we obtain the induced ANE electric ﬁeld as a function of the Pt resistivity (EMP/ rT ¼ 2.5 qPt, where the resistivity prefactor unit is Am–1 K–1).
Now, we can analyze the thickness dependence of the ANE using Eq. (3).
First, we evaluate the ANE of only the Fe3O4 layers, described by considering tMP ¼ 0 nm as shown in Fig. 3(d) ; the magnitude of Ey thus obtained cannot explain our results, with a lower magnitude of the ANE.
If we now introduce a non-negligible tMP, we can reproduce the results with a value of the magnetic Pt thickness of about tMP ¼ 0.1 nm; this is signiﬁcantly smaller than that obtained from XMCD and XRMR studies of Fe/Pt layers,29,44,45 which might possibly suggest an overestimation of the EMP value.
The thickness tMP is also smaller than a possible interdiffusion region at the Fe3O4/Pt interface, as sug- gested by STEM elemental mapping measured by electron energy loss (EELS) and electron dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopies in a [Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayer with tPt ¼ 10 nm [Fig. 3(c)], which suggest a small interface region of about 0.5nm, where the Fe and Pt signals overlap.
Even after considering a possible magnetic interdiffusion layer into our model, a non-negligible tMP is needed to explain the results FIG.

One possible scenario is that a subnanometer interdiffusion of Fe due to heating induces a modiﬁcation of the Fe coordination and increases the Fe concentration at the interface.46,47 This can result in an extrinsically induced Pt mag- netic moment around Fe due to a modiﬁcation of the nature of the F/ N interface.
This scenario is in agreement with a recent report,48 fur- ther supported by ANE measurements of a Fe3O4/Pt bilayer, with Pt ﬁlms deposited at two different temperatures (room temperature and 480 C, supplementary material), showing an increase in the ANE for Pt grown at higher temperature and could also possibly explain the non-zero ANE observed for T < TV [Fig. 2(c)].
Finally, we would like to expand our model to describe the dependence of the interface-induced ANE on the number of multi- layers.
For a [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayer, the expression of the ANE- induced electric ﬁeld is Ey ¼ 1 1 þ qMPqF ntPt  ð2n  1ÞtMP ½  qPt ntFqMP þ ð2n  1ÞtMPqF ½   ntFqMPEF þ ð2n  1ÞtMPqFEMP ntFqMP þ ð2n  1ÞtMPqF   : (4) Using the values of EMP and tMP previously estimated, we can obtain the dependence of the interface-induced ANE as a function of the number of layers n. Figure 4 shows the comparison between the ANE measured in the PM conﬁguration for two sets of multilayers with tPt ¼ 7 and 17 nm and the estimation using Eq. (4).
Our model can describe the dependence of the ANE-induced electric ﬁeld with the number of bilayers (n) and the layer thicknesses, and the magnitude of the predicted ANE in the multilayers is slightly smaller than the mea- sured one especially in the case of thinner samples.
The observed mag- nitude difference could be possibly due to the presence of additional contributions, such as interface-roughness-induced spin-orbit effects in the ferromagnetic layer,49 which can generate ANE-like voltages as suggested in Ref. 18.
In summary, we observed a non-negligible ANE in [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers and investigated its origin by systematic measurements in [Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayers as a function of the Pt thickness.
The results can be understood by an interface-induced ANE, with its origin possi- bly due to a heat-induced subnanometer Fe-Pt interdiffusion, which possibly affects the Fe coordination and/or the elemental composition at the interface.
Measurements of the magnetic moment and length- scale of the magnetic interface (tMP) as a function of Pt deposition temperature obtained by other techniques (XMCD and XRMR) can help to further clarify the origin of the observed effect.
These results suggest the possibility of tuning the thermoelectric response by ther- mal treatment and that, although the SSE is the dominant mechanism, the interface-induced ANE can positively contribute to the spin- induced thermopower in multilayer systems.
