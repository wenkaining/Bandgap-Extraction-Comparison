In the present study, the hydrophilicity dependence of the phase structure was clariﬁed qualitatively by varying the interaction potential between hydrophilic molecules and water molecules in a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation using the Jury model.
By varying the coefﬁcient of the interaction potential x between hydrophilic beads and water molecules as x = −20,0,10, and 20, at a dimensionless temperature of T = 0.5 and a concentration of amphiphilic molecules in water of φ = 50%, the phase structures grew to lamellar (x = −20), hexagonal (x = 0), and micellar (x = 10) phases.
For x = 20, phase separation occurs between hydrophilic beads and water molecules. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The phase structure of C12E6 was investigated by Mitchell [1] in 1983.
In recent years, phase diagrams at equilibrium, as well as non-equilibrium and steady- state conditions have been investigated (see Ref. [2]).
Israelachvili proposed the packing parameter as a means of clarifying the relationship between macro- scopic structure and microscopic molecular shape [3,4].

Schematic diagram of packing parameter [3,4].
A gray ball and a twisting black line are used to denote the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, respectively, of an amphiphilic molecule.
The packing parameter p ≡V/Sl controls the shape of the aggregates.
Here, the parameter V is the volume occupied by the hydrophobic tail, S denotes the sectional area of a hydrophilic group, and l is the “maximum effective length” of the hydrophobic tail.
of the sectional area of a hydrophilic group S and the “maximum effective length (l)” of the hydropho- bic tail (see Fig. 1).
Spherical micelles are expected when p ⩽1/3.
When 1/3 ⩽p ⩽1/2, cylinders are expected, and for p ∼1, bilayers should form.
The concept of the packing parameter is intuitive and acceptable.
However, calculating the packing pa- rameter is very difﬁcult, even by computer simulation, because it is almost impossible to derive macroscopic phase structure at the microscopic level by simulation, using techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, for example.
In order to overcome the gap between macroscopic behavior and microscopic mo- tion, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation has been proposed as a new mesoscopic motion simu- lation technique [5–8].
The DPD algorithm might be considered as one of the coarse-grained methods of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
In 1999, using an empirical method, Jury et al. succeeded in the DPD simulation of the smectic mesophase of a simple amphiphilic molecule sys- tem with water solvent [9].
Their minimal model (herein referred to as the Jury model), which is composed of rigid AB dimers in a solvent com- posed of W monomers, was shown to be proper for the presentation of the phase diagram of surfactant hexaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E6) and wa- ter (H2O) [1,9].
In addition, one of the present au- thors, revealed the dynamical processes of the self- organization of one smectic mesophase using the mod- iﬁed Jury model [10], where AB dimer is ﬂexible.
Since some of the information about the interaction potential between particles is neglected or simpliﬁed in DPD simulation, we need to select the dominant interaction potential for the mesoscopic structure for- mation.
Since we do not have sufﬁcient experimental data for the interaction potentials, deﬁning the interac- tion parameters in DPD simulation becomes difﬁcult.
The present paper reports an examination of the dependence of macroscopic phase structure on hy- drophilicity by varying the interaction potential be- tween hydrophilic molecules and water molecules in DPD simulation as a ﬁrst step toward clarifying the relationship between interaction potentials and the macroscopic structure (Section 3).
By strengthening hydrophilicity, water-particles penetrate closer to the hydrophilic heads (A), and therefore the heads go apart from each other.
Moreover, the length of AB dimer be- comes larger, because a repulsive force between water (W) and hydrophobic tail (B) becomes stronger.
In this way, it is expected that p can be varied and that macro- scopic structure deforms.
In Section 3, we compare the simulation results and the experiments for C12E6 and C12E8.
We also discuss about another interaction potential, that is, the head- head (A–A) interaction.
2. Simulation method 2.1.
DPD algorithm In the present study, we used the DPD model and algorithm [6,9,10].
According to the ordinary DPD model, all atoms are coarse-grained to particles of the same mass.
The total number of particles is deﬁned as N.
The position and velocity vectors of particle i (i = 1,...,N) are indicated by ri and vi, respec- tively.
Particle i moves according to the following equation of motion, where all physical quantities are made dimensionless in order to facilitate handling in actual simulation.
(1) dri dt = vi, (2) dvi dt = N  j (̸=i) F ij, where particle i interacts with another particle, j, ac- cording to the total force, F ij, which is comprised of four forces as follows: (3) F ij = F C ij + F R ij + F D ij + F B ij.
In Eq. (3), F C ij is a conservative force derived from a potential exerted on particle i by particle j, F D ij andH. Nakamura, Y. Tamura / Computer Physics Communications 169 (2005) 139–143 141 F R ij are the dissipative and random forces between par- ticles i and j, respectively.
Furthermore, neighboring particles on the same amphiphilic molecule are bound by the bond-stretching force F B ij.
The conservative force F C ij has the following form: (4) F C ij ≡ aij(1 −rij)nij if rij < 1, 0 if rij ⩾1, where rij ≡ri −rj,rij = |rij|, and nij ≡rij |rij |.
For computational convenience, we adopted a cut-off dis- tance of unit length.
The conservative force F C ij is as- sumed to be truncated beyond this cutoff.
Coefﬁcients aij denote the coupling constants between particles i and j. Español and Warren proposed the following simple form of the random and dissipative forces [11]: (5) F R ij = σω(rij)nij ζij √ t , (6) F D ij = −σ 2 2T ω(rij)2(vij · nij)nij, where vij = vi −vj and ζij is a Gaussian random valu- able with zero mean and unit variance that is chosen independently for each pair (i,j) of interacting parti- cles at each time-step and ζij = ζji.
The strength of the dissipative forces is determined by the dimensionless parameter σ.
The parameter t is the dimensionless time-interval used to integrate the equation of motion.
Here, the function ω is deﬁned by [6,11]: (7) ω(r) = 1 −r if r < 1, 0 if r ⩾1.
Finally, we use the following form as the bond- stretching force: (8) F B ij = −aBω(rij)nij, where aB is the potential energy coefﬁcient. 2.2.
Simulation model and parameters We used the modiﬁed Jury model molecule for a dimer composed of a hydrophilic particle (A) and a hy- drophobic particle (B) [9,10].
In addition, water mole- cules were modeled as coarse-grained particles (W).
The masses of all particles were assumed to be unity.
The number density of particles ρ was set to ρ = 6.
The number of modeled amphiphilic molecules AB Table 1 Table of coefﬁcients aij depending on particle type for particles i and j, where W is a water particle, A is a hydrophilic particle, and B is a hydrophobic particle.
By varying the coefﬁcient x between A and W particles as x = −20,0,10, and 20, the dependence of the phase structure on the hydrophilicity is clariﬁed aij W A B W 25 x 50 A x 25 30 B 50 30 25 was NAB, where the number of water molecules was NW.
The total number of particles N ≡2NAB + NW was ﬁxed to N = 10000.
The simulation box was set to cubic.
The dimensionless length of the box L was (9) L = N ρ 1/3 ∼11.85631.
In simulation, we used a periodic boundary condition.
The interaction coefﬁcient aij in Eq. (4) is given in Ta- ble 1.
In order to clarify the dependence of the phase structure on molecular shape, we varied the coefﬁ- cient x between A and W particles as x = −20,0,10, and 20.
When the coefﬁcient x is positive, the conser- vative force between A and W becomes repulsive.
On the other hand, negative x gives the attractive force be- tween A and W.
The coefﬁcient of the bond-stretching interaction potential aB is adopted as aB = 100.
We set the di- mensionless time-interval of one step to t = 0.05.
As the initial conﬁguration, all of the particles were located randomly.
The velocity of each particle was distributed so as to satisfy a Maxwell distribution with dimensionless temperature T .
The dimension- less strength of dissipative forces was σ = 3.3541 √ T .
During the simulation, we set T = 0.5 and φ = 50%.
3. Simulation results and discussions We demonstrated the dependence of macroscopic phase structure on hydrophilicity by varying the A–W interaction potential coefﬁcient x.
By varying the co- efﬁcient of the interaction potential x as x = −20, 0,10, and 20, the phase structures became lamellar (x = −20), hexagonal (x = 0), and micellar (x = 10) phases.
For x = 20, phase separation occurs between hydrophilic beads and water molecules.

Lamellar, hexagonal, and micelles phases are indicated as Lα, H1, and L1, respectively.
For x = 20, AB molecules and W molecules are separated, as shown in Fig. 2 x Formed structures −20 Lα 0 H1 10 L1 20 Phase separation for each x is shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Ta- ble 2.
This ﬁgure shows that the packing parameter p becomes smaller from p ∼1 (lamellar phase) to p ∼1/3 (micellar phase), when the interaction coefﬁ- cient x becomes larger (i.e. less hydrophilic).
(When x = 20, phase separation appears.
In this case, the packing parameter p cannot be used to clarify the phase structure.) Thus, we could demonstrate that the packing parameter can be varied indirectly by chang- ing the hydrophilicity.
Next, we discuss the dependence of the shape of AB dimer on varying the A–W interaction.
In order to obtain the information on the molecular shape, we plot the radial distribution function of the solute particles g(r) for each x in Fig. 3.
To be exact, we comment the Fig. 3.
Solute particle radial distribution function g(r) vs. distance between two particles r for x = −20,0,10, and 20.
The function g(r) is the sum of the A–A radial distribution function, the B–B radial distribution function, and the A–B radial distribution function.
The ﬁrst peak l(x) of each curve corresponds to the length of AB dimer.
deﬁnition of the g(r); g(r) is the sum of A–A, B–B, and A–B radial distribution functions.
We marked the ﬁrst peaks for each x in the upper-right frame in Fig. 3.
The bond-stretching interaction in AB dimer (Eq. (8)) is the most attractive force among all interaction forces in the present model (Table 1).
Therefore, the distance between A and B in an intra-molecule corresponds to the ﬁrst peak l(x) of g(r).
From Fig. 3, it is found that l becomes larger, as the parameter x becomes smaller (i.e. the A–W interaction becomes more hy- drophilic).
On the other hand, Fig. 2 showed that p becomes larger, when x becomes smaller.
Therefore, it is found that the a conical AB dimer with the head particle (A) attached to a short tail (B) forms spherical micelles for large x and that AB dimer varies its shape from cone to cylinder by increasing tail’s length l, as x becomes smaller.
Last, we comment on amphiphilic molecule ex- periments.
The phase diagram of C12E6 is differentH. Nakamura, Y. Tamura / Computer Physics Communications 169 (2005) 139–143 143 from that of C12E8, because the hydrophilic head of C12E6 is shorter than that of C12E8.
It is known [1] that the lamellar phase region in the phase diagram of C12E8 is narrower than that of C12E6.
Moreover, the hexagonal phase region in the phase diagram of C12E8 is larger than that of C12E6.
In the present model, C12E8 corresponds to smaller x (i.e. more hydrophilic) than C12E6.
From our simulation, it is found that the hexagonal phase trends to the lamellar phase, as the x becomes smaller.
Therefore, it is expected that the hexagonal phase region of the diagram for smaller x becomes smaller than that for larger x.
This predic- tion by simulation contradicts the experimental fact.
This contradiction derives its origin from the fact that we adopted only the head–water interaction parame- ter x as a variable to clarify the macroscopic phase.
It might be seen intuitively reasonable to adopt only the head–water interaction as a descriptor for distin- guishing C12E6 vs. C12E8.
However, the difference between C12E6 and C12E8 is not only the strength of the head–water interaction but also that of the head– head interaction, by which the packing parameter can be controlled directly.
As the result, we found that the head–head interaction dominates the structure forma- tion process of C12En series more than the head–water interaction.
