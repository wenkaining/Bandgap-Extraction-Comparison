We develop a new theoretical formalism using a spatially dependent effective mass that is related to the magnitude of the interface potential.
Using this formalism, we studied Ge quantum dots (QDs) formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and co-sputtering (sputter).
These samples allowed us to isolate important consequences arising from differences in the interface potential.
We found that for a higher interface potential, as in the case of PECVD QDs, there is a larger reduction in the effective mass, which increases the conﬁnement energy with respect to the sputter sample.
We further understood the action of O interface states by comparing our results with Ge QDs grown by molecular beam epitaxy.
It is found that the O states can sup- press the inﬂuence of the interface potential.
From our theoretical formalism, we determine the length scale over which the interface potential inﬂuences the effective mass.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4918549] I. INTRODUCTION Si and Ge nanostructures (NSs) remain amongst the most important materials for photovoltaic and electronic applications.1,2 Si is extensively used in the microelectronics industry partly due to the importance and stability of its ox- ide.3 The Ge oxide states can create complications in NSs.
Fabrication of Ge NSs in a SiO2 matrix often results in a high concentration of interface defect states,4–6 because Ge can easily occupy the Si position within the SiO2 matrix due to its low formation energy.
Sub-oxide interface states give rise to a defect photoluminescence (PL) band that can domi- nate quantum conﬁnement (QC) effects.5 However, with careful control over the fabrication7 and characterization8 conditions, Ge NSs do clearly demonstrate QC effects.
Furthermore, because of a larger Bohr radius in Ge compared to Si, Ge has the advantage of greater tunability in the gap energy (EG) due to QC.9 Moreover, it was recently demon- strated that the interface defect states may enhance the efﬁ- ciency of photovoltaic devices due to preferential hole trapping.9 The nature of its interfacial structure is arguably the deﬁning parameter of a NS.
Fundamentally, the introduction of an interface modiﬁes bulk parameters5 and introduces new phenomena.
Interface states can break valley degener- acy.10 Dangling bonds, stress, and defect states elicit the degree to which the interface potential conﬁnes charge car- riers.5 Hydrogen versus oxygen termination at the interface inﬂuences the oscillator strength11 and creates polarization effects at the interface.12 Nanostructure sensing devices rely on the charge conﬁguration at the interface, which “communicates” with the environment13 and determines the conductivity within the NS.14 Nonetheless, the role of the interface remains largely misunderstood.15 The exact band energy alignment at the interface remains a topic of intense research,16 as it is difﬁcult to establish the exact chemical environment at the interface.17 Defect engineering at the interface can have a complicated effect on the QC of the charge carriers,18,19 which can be difﬁcult to model theoretically.20,21 The crystal potential changes across the interface of a NS and thus the carrier effective mass (EM) changes, which is modelled by invoking the Bastard-type boundary condi- tions.22–25 There is experimental6,26–28 and theoretical29,30 evidence that the EM should depend on the NS dimension.
Understanding how the EM varies in low-dimension remains a challenge as experimental measurements are model de- pendent,31,32 and it is difﬁcult to theoretically scale the EM to low dimensions.6,33 Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the EM from the density of states.29 However, it is not clear how to model the interface nor the excited states within DFT.25,34 A common pitfall in theoretical modelling is the lack of information regarding the interface atomic potentials, which leads to extensive use of H-terminated surfaces at the expense of the experimental details.5 Sub-oxide interfaces are typically modelled using OH termination.35,36 The local density approximation is used to correct for the local charge environment to obtain agreement with the experimental opti- cal gap.5,35 However, there are recent theoretical results using embedding matrices such as SiC.37 Reference 33 em- bedded Si NSs in a SiO2 matrix by inserting O atoms between Si–Si bonds followed by a randomizing procedure leading to defect and stress free structures.

Indeed, theoretical studies have suggested5,6,40 EG  Dx, where 1  x  2 and D is the NS diameter, which has been demonstrated experi- mentally.5,41,42 In this work, we elucidate the precise role of the interface potential on the EM.
An analytic formalism for the EM and interface30 was developed and applied to study Ge quantum dots (QDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).43 The parameters developed during our study on MBE Ge QDs are transferred to the present study on rf- magnetron co-sputtering (sputtering) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) Ge QDs.
The PECVD and sputter samples were chosen for this work because they were fabricated under similar experimental conditions, but exhibit a measurable variation in the chemical structure of the interface.
Both sputtered and PECVD QDs have the same dimensional dependence as the MBE QDs, which allows us to isolate the role of the interface potential on the EM.
Comparing PECVD and sputter samples, it is found that as the interface potential increases the EM is reduced thus increasing the conﬁnement energy.
We determine the length scale at which the EM is modiﬁed due to the interface poten- tial.
Furthermore, by comparing with MBE Ge QDs we ﬁnd that O interface states can suppress this mechanism.
These results are important for solar cell applications, as we recently demonstrated that defects at the interface can be engineered to enhance the light harvesting capabilities in Ge QDs.9 II.
EXPERIMENT In this work, we focus our analysis on experimental results from two fabrication methods for Ge QDs that pro- duce different interface potentials.
Thin ﬁlms of Ge-rich SiO2 were deposited using either PECVD8 or sputtering.9 Thermal annealing was carried out at 800 C or 600 C in N2 for PECVD or sputtered samples, respectively, to promote Ge QD nucleation. In Refs.
8 and 9, the experimental details of diameter control and determination are discussed along with crystallinity measurements.
Both PECVD and sputtered QDs were determined to be in an amorphous state with a bulk gap energy (EGð1Þ) of 0.8 eV. The average diameter in the sputter samples varies from 2 to 4 nm; while in PECVD samples, it varies from 3.5 to 8.4 nm.
Optical absorption measurements were performed to assess the variation in EG with QD diameter.
Ge NSs embedded in an oxide matrix typ- ically demonstrate a PL spectrum dominated by a high con- centration of sub-oxide related defects at the interface between the Ge NS and the oxide matrix, thus masking the QC related PL band.5 In Refs.
8 and 9, the absorption spec- trum was considered over the PL spectrum, because defects states in the GeO2 interface made it difﬁcult to measure the variation of EG with QD diameter from the emission spec- trum,44 which is more sensitive to mid-gap defects.45 Finally, it is worth noting that due to NS size distribution and carrier leakage there is some inherent error in associating the NS experimental EGðDÞ with the correct experimental D, see Ref. 5 for more details.
From the absorption spectra, the oscillator strength and EGðDÞ were found in Refs.
8 and 9 for each D using the Tauc method.
The applicability of the Tauc method to NSs is discussed, in detail, in Ref. 9.
The Tauc method is based on a semi-empirical model for amorphous systems, which assumes parabolic band edges and optical inter-band transi- tions between quasi localized states (i.e., momentum is not conserved).46 Indeed, the method assumes that the dipole- matrix element (proportional to the oscillator strength) is not k-dependent.
Breaking of momentum (k-vector) conserva- tion is a fundamental tenant of quantum conﬁnement in NSs.
Furthermore, our NSs are amorphous and thus lack long range order.
In addition, the parabolic band edge picture can still be applied in a NS as discussed in Sec. III.
A deviation from linearity happens at low rh due to Urbach tail regions.
For this reason, the estimation of EG for amorphous materials is usually performed for values of r larger than 2  109 cm2 (for our samples), where a clear linear trend in the Tauc plots appears.47 Furthermore, the EG was calculated from scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on Ge QDs to be 1.4 eV.48 This value agrees with our EG determined via the Tauc method for a similar diameter range.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that the Tauc method works well for amorphous NSs and has been experimentally demonstrated in the literature.27,47 III.
THEORY The analysis of the experimental data is carried out using a variety of theoretical tools.
The approach taken in this work considers an interface-related correction to the effective mass approximation (EMA).
The validity of the EMA has been widely debated in the literature.5 Generally, it is assumed that the parabolic band approximation breaks down at low-dimension and thus the EMA cannot be applied.
However, recently it has been shown that a notion of a “fuzzy-band-structure” holds for NSs down to 2 nm,49 and that the k  p method does produce the correct symmetry of a QD.50 The EMA is a ﬁrst order approximation of the k  p generalization that considers transitions only at the conduc- tion band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM).
In a NS, transitions mainly occur near the Brillouin zone center (the C-point), due to breaking of the momentum selection rules.6 This type of transition is referred to as pseu- dodirect.51,52 From a theoretical perspective, pseudodirect behavior allows one to ignore phonon events in the formal- ism.
When a 30-band k  p model is considered, spurious sol- utions are found, which can be removed computationally.53 A two-conduction-band k  p approach has also been used54 to describe conduction band hybridization, and a two-band approximation6 demonstrates good agreement with experi- ment.25 A justiﬁcation of the EMA is given in detail in Refs. 5 and 6.
DFT models including interface corrections have been employed in the literature,21,36 and produce a similar dimensional dependence as the method presented here.35 154304-2 Barbagiovanni et al. J. Appl.

Also, the DFT approaches use a different interface passivation from the actual experiment one.
First, we employ a new theoretical formalism using a spatially dependent effective mass (SPDEM), as detailed in Ref. 30 and formulated in Refs. 55 and 56.
The important feature here is the introduction of an inverse characteristic length scale: c2 ¼ 2D2, where D is the QD diameter in nanometres.
c is not tunable, but was derived in Ref.
30 and modiﬁes the dispersion relation of the charge carriers, as described in Sec.
V. c acts as a coupling parameter between the momentum of the charge carriers and the conﬁnement potential.
In this formalism, the conﬁnement potential, VC, was given by VC;i ¼ Vo exp 2 D2c2 i ln2 1 þ ciri ð Þ   ; (1) where ri is the particle position in the i ¼ x; y; z direction and Vo is deﬁned as the energy difference between the QD and the matrix material at the CBM or the VBM for an electron (Vo;e) or hole (Vo;h), respectively.
Using a point canonical transformation (PCT), we demonstrated that the SPDEM is directly related to the conﬁnement potential.
This effect is analogous to the relationship between the crystal potential and the bare electron mass.30 Therefore, the SPDEM formal- ism is well adapted to describe the effect of VC on the effec- tive mass and yields the dispersion relation EG D ð Þ ¼ EG 1 ð Þ þ 3hﬃﬃﬃ 2 p D ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Vo;e m	 o;e s þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Vo;h m o;h s 2 4 3 5; (2) where m	 o;e and m o;h are the bulk electron and hole effective mass, respectively.
The second model used in our analysis is the EMA, as detailed in Ref. 6.
This model describes electron-hole con- ﬁnement conditions within an inﬁnite conﬁnement potential context, according to the relation EG D ð Þ ¼ EG 1 ð Þ þ 7:88 D2 eV  nm2: (3) We note that EMA presented here is used to describe only the effect of reduced dimension on the electron and hole and includes no additional effects.
However, we discovered a physically signiﬁcant phenomenological correction43to both the SPDEM and EMA models, which was applied to obtain agreement between the two theories, given by ~l D ð Þ ¼ loeSPDEMD 1 þ 1 aD2 þ bD þ c   ; (4) l D ð Þ ¼ loeEMA 1 þ 1 aD2 þ bD þ c   ; (5) where a ¼ 0.047 nm2, b ¼ 0.160 nm1, and c ¼ 0.035 are identical for both renormalized masses, ~lðDÞ and lðDÞ, and were determined in Ref. 43.
The parameters “a,” “b,” and “c” were determined from PL measurements on MBE Ge QDs.43 Reference 57 noted that these QDs experience strong exciton localization and thus there is no Stokes shift between the absorption and the emission spectrum.
According to the theory of QC, localization in position space breaks the mo- mentum selection rules and thus phonon coupling is not required for indirect gap materials.5 In Refs.
5 and 6, we noted that a measured Stokes shift was a consequence of interfacial phononic modes (e.g., vibrons).
Strong breaking of the momentum selection rules (or time-reversibility) denoted as “strong conﬁnement” is included in both the EMA6 and the SPDEM30 models.
We showed previously6 that amorphous NSs experience strong conﬁnement in the electron and hole states.
In our model, the interface potential inﬂuences the effec- tive mass, as noted above and discussed in Sec. V.
The pa- rameters eSPDEM in ½nm1  and eEMA renormalize the bulk reduced mass, lo, and will be discussed in Sec. IV.
Therefore, we conclude that the parameters “a,” “b,” and “c” are valid for both absorption and emission spectrum, while the inﬂuence of the interface is contained in the parameter “e.” The parameters “a,” “b,” and “c” are the same for all Ge QD samples and their physical signiﬁcance is discussed fur- ther in Sec. V.
Our aim in this work is to understand the inﬂuence of the interface on the EM.
This inﬂuence is con- tained solely in the parameter “e,” which is introduced as correction to the EMA and SPDEM models.
This parameter gives us access to the macroscopic features of the interface that would, otherwise, be inaccessible within the standard EMA.
Therefore, when we use Eqs.
(4) and (5) with Eqs.
(2) and (3), respectively, we obtain perfect agreement in the dis- persion relations43 allowing us to isolate essential differences in the physics between the two models, as described Sec. V.
It is important to note that we are presenting a phenomeno- logical analysis and not presenting these models as an alter- native to previously existing theoretical models.
Our intention is to compare the results of two models across dif- ferent fabrication methods to extract physically relevant in- formation correlated with the variation in our parameter set.
A. Methodology For the sputter and PECVD Ge QDs, we use Eqs.
(4) and (5) in the SPDEM-~lðDÞ and EMA-lðDÞ (see Ref. 43) models to determine the relationship between the interface potential and EM.
For all QD samples, the term ð1 þ ðaD2 þ bD þ cÞ1Þ in Eqs.
(4) and (5) is the same, thus ensuring that all samples have the same dimensional depend- ence, as found in Ref. 43.
Therefore, we are left to determine only Vo;e; Vo;h, and the parameter e. First, we consider Vo;e and Vo;h.
From x-ray photoemis- sion spectroscopy (XPS) in sputtered Ge QDs, a Ge-Ge sig- nal was measured in the as-deposited ﬁlm, see Fig. 1.
This signal indicated that Ge QDs formed upon initial ﬁlm deposi- tion.
From the XPS results, neither Ge-Si nor Si-Si signal are observed indicating that all of the Ge is either within the QD or in an oxide state, and all of the Si is in the SiO2 state.9 Therefore, sputter thin ﬁlm deposition, under our given ex- perimental conditions, can be modelled approximately by 154304-3 Barbagiovanni et al.

In the top part of Fig. 2, we indicate a region of Ge surrounded by layer of GeOx and a thin layer of GeO2.
Upon annealing, the Ge QD diameter and the stoi- chiometric oxide concentration increase.
This is a result of Ge diffusing from the Ge-rich GeOx region into the Ge QD region,60 which is indicated in the bottom part of Fig. 2.
Simultaneously, it is possible that O diffuses toward the GeO2 region.
This observation implies that the interface between the Ge QD and the matrix material is comprised of a large concentration of GeOx states.
As a ﬁrst approximation, we consider a Ge-GeO interface with a potential of approximately V0;e ¼ 0.6 eV and V0;h ¼ 1.8 eV.61 In the case of PECVD QDs, a different behaviour was observed.
Here, the QDs are more accurately modelled by the random bonding model (RBM), under our given experi- mental conditions,58 see Fig. 3.
In the RBM, all of the Ge is assumed to be in one of its oxide states.63 Raman measure- ments (see Ref.
8) indicate that upon deposition the ﬁlm is primarily in a Ge sub-oxide state, i.e., there is no clear obser- vation of a Ge-Ge signal, as represented in the top part of Fig. 3.
After annealing, GeOx will phase separate into Ge QDs and GeO2 mediated by Ge diffusion, as represented in the bottom part of Fig. 3.
As in the case of sputter QDs, it is possible that O undergoes diffusion as well.
This behaviour implies that the interface is mainly composed of GeO2.
Though there must still exists a small concentration (as com- pared to sputtered Ge QDs) of GeOx right at the interface, which will lower the interface potential slightly from the ideal GeO2 value.
Therefore, we assume that the interface potential is close to the value of Ge-GeO2, which is V0;e ¼ 1.2 eV and V0;h ¼ 3.6 eV.64 The ﬁnal step is to determine e for both the SPDEM and the EMA models.
We consider a Tauc plot of the experimen- tal absorption cross section, r, for PECVD and sputtered Ge QDs from Refs.
8 and 9, respectively.

EGðDÞ is given by either SPDEM-~lðDÞ or EMA-lðDÞ, in Eq. (6).
EGðDÞ and D were determined experimentally in Refs.
8 and 9, see Sec. II.
In the case of EMA-lðDÞ, we ﬁt Eq. (6) via eEMA to the experimental data for each QD D and EGðDÞ.
For SPDEM-~lðDÞ, as we noted above, the interface potential was approximated from our discussion of the RMM, or RBM for the sputter, or PECVD samples, respec- tively.
Since these models are only a ﬁrst approximation, we allowed Vo;e and Vo;h to vary within 25% of their proposed values, and then we ﬁtted Eq. (6) to the data by varying eSPDEM and Vo;eðhÞ for each experimental QD D and EGðDÞ. IV.
RESULTS The results obtained from ﬁtting SPDEM-~lðDÞ to the sputtered and PECVD samples are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.
The deviation from linearity in the experimen- tal data at low rh is due to Urbach tail regions, i.e., defect states near the band edge, which are common to amorphous structures as in this work.9 In PECVD samples (Fig. 5), there is a deviation from linearity at high rh due to a partial crys- talline transition in less than 30% of the QDs after annealing at 800 C.8 When the ﬁt was constrained to the linear region, a less than 1% difference was found in our ﬁnal ﬁtting pa- rameters compared to ﬁtting over the entire data set.
The ﬁt- ted value for eSPDEM is listed for each QD D, in Figs. 4 and 5, and the resultant interface potential (also shown) was found to be notably identical (within 1%) for each QD D. eSPDEM for each QD D is the same within experimental error, therefore, in our formulation of EGðDÞ, we use the average value, hei ¼ 0.181 and 0.090 for sputter and PECVD, respec- tively.
Likewise, eEMA varies only within experimental error.
The results of our analysis are summarized in Table I. Table I also lists the results from the EMA ﬁt and the values for MBE Ge QDs.
In Fig. 6, we plot the experimental data for PECVD8 and sputter9 Ge QDs along with the SPDEM-~lðDÞ curve.
The interface potential, eEMA, and EGð1Þ are listed in Fig. 6 for reference. In Sec.
III, we mentioned that the SPDEM- ~lðDÞ and EMA-lðDÞ models agree with each other.
The pa- rameters a, b, and c in Eqs.
(4) and (5) were found by analy- sing MBE grown Ge QDs.43 There is a good agreement between the experimental data and our calculation, noting that the error bars in the D of the PECVD samples are on the order of 2 nm.8 The EG for the PECVD grown samples is higher than the sputter samples.
The reason for the difference is under- stood within our models.
From the SPDEM-~lðDÞ model, we ﬁnd a larger interface potential in PECVD samples compared to the sputter samples.
The larger interface potential is corre- lated with a larger reduction in eEMA, which increases the conﬁnement energy.
MBE Ge QDs were fabricated with an a-Si matrix, which has a lower interface potential than both PECVD and sputter Ge QDs, see Fig. 6.
However, the EG is comparable to the other two samples with a value of eEMA in between the PECVD and sputter values.
It is difﬁcult to make a full comparison between the sputter and the PECVD FIG.

However, we can consider a few essential differences.
In the case of the MBE QDs, there are no O-defect states,43,65 because of the unique fabrication method.
O-defect states at the inter- face increase the spread of the wave-function, thus lowering the conﬁnement energy.12 Furthermore, O interface states can pin the charge carriers, again lowering the conﬁnement energy.5,6 The combination of these phenomena lowers the conﬁnement energy in PECVD and sputter samples, in agreement with theoretical predictions,12 and it becomes comparable to that in MBE samples (see Fig. 6).
Therefore, we understand that the O interface states are the source of the difference between the sputter and the PECVD samples versus the MBE samples.
Nonetheless, we see that for a higher interface energy a larger reduction in the EM is obtained.
V. DISCUSSIONS A closer examination of the results shown in Table I in the context of our models allows us to understand the nature of the conﬁnement mechanism.
As mentioned in Sec.
III, the SPDEM theory models a modiﬁcation in the EM due to the interface potential.
In Ref. 30, we derive the envelope func- tion within the SPDEM formalism Wi ri ð Þ ¼ 2 r2 i p  1=4 exp  1 2r2 i c2 i ln2 1 þ ciri ð Þ   ; (7) where r  ðVoÞ1=2 is the Gaussian strength.
In Fig. 7, we plot the probability amplitude of Eq. (7) for a 6 nm QD as a function of the interface potential and particle position.
As the interface potential increases, the probability amplitude is increasingly localized, which implies increasing de- localization in momentum space.
A Fourier transformation of Eq. (7) demonstrated that the SPDEM envelope function exhibits an increased spread in momentum space compared to a Gaussian envelope function.30 The interface potential alters the SPDEM envelope function because of the introduc- tion of c, which modiﬁed the EM through the relation30 m ri ð Þ ¼ m	 o 1 þ ciri ð Þ2 : (8) Therefore, from ðeSPDEMÞ1, we can ﬁnd the length scale at which the EM begins to change, which is 16.95, 11.11, and 5.53 nm in MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respec- tively.
At the stated dimensions, the SPDEM energy begins to deviate from the experimental data and eSPDEM corrects for this behaviour.
In Fig. 8, we plot ~lðDÞ=lo and lðDÞ=lo from Eqs.
(4) and (5), respectively, where the role of eSPDEM can be seen.
Below diameters of around 16 and 11 nm, the MBE and PECVD ~lðDÞ=lo curves are less than 1 indicating that ~lðDÞ increases EGðDÞ below these dimensions.
The dif- ference between the cross-over dimension depicted in Fig. 8 and the value obtained from ðeSPDEMÞ1 is because of experi- mental error.
We note that in Fig. 8, the ~lðDÞ=lo curve for the sputter sample does not fall below 1. In Ref. 43, we FIG.

Therefore, the sputter ðeSPDEMÞ1 value of 5.53 nm indicates that the SPDEM mechanism is suppressed in these samples.
The different behaviour found for the sputter samples is a consequence of their interface quality (Secs. III A and IV).
The lower inter- face potential does not create a strong conﬁnement condition for the charge carriers, see Fig. 7.
Additionally, the sub- oxide interface states promote de-localization of the wave- function in real space.12 The values obtained for ðeSDPEMÞ1 also agree with the results of Fig. 6.
First, we note that the value obtained for the MBE samples of 16 nm is on the order of the Bohr radius for Ge.
This result is what we expect in these samples, because of the high quality interface.
At 16 nm, the charge carriers in the MBE samples begin to experience the inﬂuence of the conﬁnement potential, and thus their energy is modi- ﬁed, as predicted by QC.
While in the PECVD and sputter samples, the onset of QC is suppressed from the expected Bohr radius value.
Therefore, the PECVD and sputter samples experience the effects of QC over a smaller diameter range compared to MBE, and thus their EG shift is not as great.
The relationship between pure QC effects and a modiﬁed EM are understood by comparing the SPDEM-~lðDÞ results with respect to the EMA-lðDÞ results.
In a previous work on Ge QDs buried in a-Si,43we found that above  6.2 nm, the EG  D1, due to a modiﬁcation in the EM, while below 4.6nm, the EG  D2, due to pure QC effects.
These pa- rameters come from the term ð1 þ ðaD2 þ bD þ cÞ1Þ in Eqs.
(4) and (5), and represent a universal dimensional depend- ence.
The parameter e represents a correction to these ideal length scales due to additional effects not included in the theory, which in our analysis include the O-interface states.
If we consider the ratio eEMA=eSPDEM, then we obtain 3.05 and 2.81 nm for sputter and PECVD samples, respectively.
This length scale signiﬁes when the conﬁnement behaviour changes from the SPDEM to the EMA model and is depicted in Fig. 8 by the vertical line at 2.9 nm.
Within experimental error, we thus ﬁnd that pure QC effects dominate at 2.9 nm, which is suppressed from the ideal case (between 6.2 and 4.6 nm) due to the interface states.
On the other hand, the same ratio in MBE samples gives 6.4 nm (see vertical line in Fig. 8), which is in agreement with the ideal value (6.2 nm), because there are no O interface states in this sample.
Finally, this is in agreement with previous results obtained in Ref.
43, where the MBE value of 6 nm was found to be the dimension that produces the most efﬁcient luminescence.
From our work here, we understand this result on the basis that this is the dimension at which the behaviour changes from SPDEM to EMA and thus carriers are strongly conﬁned.
We illustrate collectively all of the phenomena described in this manuscript in Fig. 9.
At the top of the ﬁg- ure, we recall the dimensional dependence of the SPDEM- ~lðDÞ and EMA-lðDÞ models.
Fig. 9 is divided into two parts.
In the “pink” region of the ﬁgure above 6 nm, the dominant model is SPDEM-~lðDÞ, which models a change in EG in conjunction with a change in the EM.
The “grey” region below 4 nm is modelled according to the EMA- FIG. 9.
Schematic illustration of the conﬁnement mechanism.
The dimensional behaviour of the SPDEM-~lðDÞ and EMA-lðDÞ is noted at the top of the ﬁgure.
In the “pink” region above 6 nm, the dominate model is SPDEM; while in the “grey” region below 4 nm, EMA is the dominant model, see Ref. 43.
The bulk EG is represented by the straight dashed line.
At 16, 11, and 5 nm, the MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respectively, experience a change in the EM and hence EG, according to the SPDEM model.
The change in energy due to SPDEM is represented by the solid curved line in the three regions for the respec- tive samples (not drawn to scale).
At 6 and 3 nm, the MBE and PECVD/sputter samples, respectively, change behaviour from SPDEM to EMA.
The change in energy due to EMA is represented by the dashed curved line in the two regions for the respective samples (not drawn to scale).
The lower dimensions in PECVD and sputter samples compared to the predicted pink and grey regions are a result of the O interface.

The “pink” and “grey” regions were determined from the results of Ref.
43 and come from the universal dimensional parameters a and b in the term ð1 þ ðaD2 þ bD þ cÞ1Þ. From the parameter ðeSPDEMÞ1, we determined the onset of the SPDEM behaviour at 16, 11, and 5 nm in the MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respectively.
The change in energy due to SPDEM is represented by the solid curved line in Fig. 9 for the three samples (not drawn to scale).
The MBE sample’s value is in agreement with the Bohr radius for Ge and indicates when the charge carriers ﬁrst “feel” the conﬁnement potential.
In the case of PECVD and sputter samples, this value is suppressed due to the O states at the interface, which cause the wave-function to leak into the matrix and thus lowers the conﬁnement energy, as described above.
The PECVD case has a higher value than the sputter case due to the higher conﬁnement potential and thus experience a larger change in EG, due to an increased reduction in the EM.
The transition point from SPDEM to EMA is on the order of 5 nm according to the transition from the “pink” to the “grey” region in Fig. 9.
From the ratio of eEMA to eSPDEM, we determined this transition for each sample.
The change in energy due to EMA is represented by the dashed curved line in Fig. 9 for the three samples (not drawn to scale).
In the case of MBE sample, the transition is in agree- ment with the calculated value at 6 nm, because of the lack of O at the interface.
While in PECVD and sputter samples they both change behaviour at around 3 nm.
The suppression here again is due to O interface states, as described above. VI.
CONCLUSIONS Using a previously developed theoretical formalism as an analytical tool, we have been able to understand the rela- tionship between the EM and the interface potential.
We found that when the interface potential was large there exists a strong reduction in the EM.
This condition was clearly demonstrated when comparing PECVD and sputter samples, where the PECVD case has a larger interface potential.
However, if the sample contains O states at the interface, then the conﬁnement energy was reduced due to these states.
This result was noted by comparing MBE sam- ples with no O interface states to the PECVD and sputter samples.
We determined the length scale where the samples begin to experience a modiﬁcation in EG due to a change in the EM, which was 16, 11, and 5 nm for MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respectively.
The lower values in PECVD and sputter samples compared to MBE samples were understood in terms of the O interface states.
We found the length scale where the QC mechanism changes from SPDEM to EMA, which was 6 and 3 nm in MBE and PECVD/sputter samples, respectively.
All of these results are summarised graphically in Fig. 9.
These results indicate an additional carrier conﬁnement mechanism in NSs, which can be exploited for device fabrication through interface engineering.
From this work, we have found a dynamic relationship between the magnitude of the interface potential and the EM with respect to the chemical composi- tion of the interface.
