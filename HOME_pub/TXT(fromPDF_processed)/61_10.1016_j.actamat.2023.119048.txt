Predicting the early stages of solid-state precipitation in Al-rich Al-Pt alloys  Shenghan Su a, Laure Bourgeois a,b,*, Nikhil V. Medhekar a,*  a Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, VIC 3800, Australia  b Monash Centre for Electron Microscopy, Monash University, VIC 3800, Australia    A R T I C L E  I N F O    Keywords:  Al alloys  Platinum  Interface  Precipitation  DFT  A B S T R A C T The high strength of structural aluminium alloys depends strongly on the controlled precipitation of specific  intermetallic phases, whose identity and crystal structure can be difficult to predict.
Here, we investigate the Al-  Pt system, which shows some similarity to the Al-Cu system as one of the main intermetallic phases, Al2Pt, is  nearly isostructural with θ ′ (Al2Cu), the metastable phase responsible for the high-strength of Al-Cu alloys.
Using  a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and classical nucleation theory (CNT) applied to  the Al-Pt system, we design a workflow to predict the thermodynamics of solid solution, intermediate phases  such as GP zones, stable and metastable precipitates, and their precipitation sequence.
This workflow can be  applied to an arbitrary binary alloying system.
We confirm the known stable phases Al4Pt, Al21Pt8, Al2Pt, Al3Pt2,  AlPt (α&β), Al3Pt5, AlPt2 (α&β) and AlPt3 (α&β).
We also reveal the possible existence of two phases of chemical  formulae Al5Pt and Al3Pt.
This large number of intermetallic phases is due to the strong bonding between Al and  Pt, which also leads to a significantly favourable Pt solute formation energy in the Al matrix.
Our findings are  compared with the known precipitation characteristics of the binary Al-Cu and Al-Au systems.
We find that the  θ ′-like Al2Pt precipitate phase has a lower coherent interfacial energy than θ ′. Our calculations strongly suggest  that Al2Pt will precipitate first in Al-rich Al-Pt alloys and will form bulk-like interfaces similar to η (Al2Au) rather  than like θ ′ (Al2Cu).
1. Introduction  Controlled solid-state precipitation is commonly used for achieving  significant strengthening in light structural alloys.
This is because pre­ cipitates of appropriate shape, distribution, number density and crys­ tallography can constitute effective barriers to the movement of  dislocations.
In general, high-strength alloys require uniformly and  densely distributed precipitates with high aspect ratios and a rational  crystallographic orientation [1].
A well-known alloy system containing  such precipitates is the Al-Cu system, which forms the basis of an  important class of engineering alloys for aircraft and aerospace appli­ cations [2].
In Al-Cu alloys, a fine and uniform precipitation of θ′′ (Al3Cu) and θ ′ (Al2Cu) precipitates with aspect ratios greater than 50:1  can lead to tensile strength of up to 500 MPa [2].
The θ ′ phase is  metastable and its crystal structure bears little resemblance to known  bulk phases in the Al-Cu system [3].
More generally, precipitates  forming in the early stages of precipitation are commonly metastable  phases not expected to form based on the bulk phase diagram (e.g., η ′ (AlCu) in Al-Cu alloys [4]), or they exhibit distorted structures of known  bulk phases (e.g., Ω phase in Al-Cu alloys [5]).
Consequently, predicting  the early stages of precipitation in a given alloy system through  atomic-scale modelling rather than in ad-hoc, empirical way is a very  challenging task.
Yet this endeavour is of great importance for discov­ ering and enhancing the properties of structural Al alloys.
This challenge  has motivated us to design a workflow to investigate solid-state pre­ cipitation in unexplored alloy systems using advanced atomistic simu­ lation methods.
To exemplify our workflow, we have comprehensively  investigated the Al-rich part of the largely unexplored Al-Pt alloy  system.
In the periodic table, Pt sits next to the column of Cu and Au, and  shares their cubic close-packed structure.
The Al-Pt system exhibits  several features that should make it interesting to compare with better  known Al-Cu and Al-Au binary alloys containing plate-shaped pre­ cipitates.
Firstly, amongst all Al binary alloys, the Al2Pt phase is the only  stable θ ′-like intermetallic phase besides η (Al2Au) [6].
Secondly,  several gaps remain in our knowledge of the precipitation characteristics  of Pt-containing aluminium alloys.
The latest research on the Al-Pt  system indicates the following phases to be stable: Al4Pt, Al21Pt8,  * Corresponding authors at: Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, VIC 3800, Australia.

Here, α is the low-temperature polymorph and β is the high-temperature  one-see Table 1 for details.
Al2Pt has a cubic CaF2-type structure with  aAl2Pt = 5.91 ˚A [10], which is similar to the crystal structure of θ ′ (Al2Cu) [3] when viewed along 〈110〉as shown in Fig. 1.
There remain  many unknowns regarding the Al-Pt alloy system: recent experimental  and computational studies have focused on the determination of bulk  intermetallic phases [7,8,11–13] and their applications [14,15], but  have not addressed the thermodynamics of solid solution, precipitate  interfacial structures and precipitation sequences.
One particularly  intriguing feature of the Al-Pt binary system is the existence of several  stable and metastable phases of lower Pt concentration than Al2Pt [9],  which is contrary to the Al-Cu [16] and Al-Au [17] systems where no  stable Al-rich phases exist before the θ ′ and η phases.
However, there is  hitherto no consensus on the precipitation sequences in the Al-Pt system.
For instance, it remains unclear as to which phase will form after  quenching an Al-Pt alloy, and which one will precipitate first [18–20].
In this work, we used first-principles calculations based on density-  functional theory (DFT) combined with classical nucleation theory  (CNT) to determine the thermodynamical stabilities of different phases,  precipitate interfacial energies, and precipitation sequences in the Al-Pt  binary system.
We reveal the possible existence of two new phases, Al5Pt  and Al3Pt [7–9].
Amongst all phases, only θ ′-like Al2Pt is predicted to  form thermodynamically stable coherent interfaces along the {001}Al  planes and is likely to precipitate first directly from the supersaturated  solid solution, thereby bypassing phases with higher Al content which  could be expected to form first based on chemical potential alone.
We  illustrate that solute clusters, GP zones, and non-bulk like interfaces are  unlikely to form due to the significant low solute formation energy of Pt  in the Al matrix.
Our study thus fills the knowledge gaps in the Al-Pt  alloy system and more generally, provides a workflow to determine  precipitate phases and precipitation sequence in an arbitrary binary  alloying system.
2. Methods  We first calculate the relaxed lattice parameters, thermodynamic  characteristics, elastic properties, and interfacial energies of phases in  the binary Al-Pt system using density-functional theory (DFT).
These  DFT results are then adopted as input parameters for the classical  nucleation theory (CNT) calculations to examine the precipitation  sequences.
All DFT calculations were carried out using Vienna ab initio simu­ lation package (VASP) [21–24].
The plane-wave basis set was described  by the projector augmented wave method (PAW) [25,26].
The  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional for the  generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) were used [27].
For Al, Pt,  Cu, Au and Ag, 3s23p1, 5d96s1, 3d104s1, 5d106s1, and 4d105s1 were  treated as valence electrons respectively.
The cut-off energy of 500 eV  and the grid spacing of 0.08 /˚A were used to generate a gamma-centred  Monkhorst-Pack grid for sampling the Brillouin-zone to achieve suffi­ cient accuracy for all calculations.
To achieve a sufficient accuracy,  energies and forces were converged within 1 × 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV/˚A,  respectively.
For calculations of phonons, we used a tighter energy  tolerance criterion of 1 × 10−8 eV.
We applied the CNT formalism to calculate the thermodynamics of  precipitate nucleation: ΔGtot = VΔGchem + VΔGel + Aγ, (1)   where ΔGtot is the change in total free energy during nucleation, ΔGchem  is the chemical energy, ΔGel is the elastic strain energy, γ is the average  interfacial energy, V is the volume of the nucleus, and A is the area of the  interfaces between the precipitated phases and matrix.
Further details of  CNT calculations are presented in the Supplementary Information 1. 3.
Results  We first present the thermodynamic characteristics of various phases  in Al-Pt binary system as calculated by DFT methods (see Sections 3.1,  3.2, and 3.3).
Based on the obtained thermodynamic characteristics, we  propose phases that can possibly precipitate from the supersaturated  solid solution of Pt in Al matrix.
Next we investigate interfacial struc­ ture, interfacial energies and elastic properties of the possible precipi­ tated phases in Sections 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 respectively.
Finally, we  estimate the critical nucleation radii and nucleation barriers based on  computed energies via CNT (see Section 3.7). 3.1.
Stable and metastable phases  We first investigate intermetallic phases between Al and Pt to pro­ vide a preliminary understanding of the binary Al-Pt system.
Here we  examined the crystal structure and stability of the well accepted as well  as controversial phases in this alloy system.
Our results and data re­ ported in literature are summarised in Table 1.
A challenge in deter­ mining thermodynamic characteristics of Al-rich Al-Pt alloy system is  that the full crystal structures of some reported phases, such as Al5Pt  [18] and Al3Pt [7,19,20], are still unknown.
We thus modelled these  phases based on known intermetallic phases of the same chemical for­ mula in binary systems with elements in the same group of Al and Pt.
Amongst all possible crystal structures, those with the lowest formation  energy are selected.
Al5Pt is modelled from Ga5Pd and Al3Pt is modelled  from Tl3Pt.
Further details for these calculations are provided in Sup­ plementary Information 2.
We assess the stability or metastability of  different Al-Pt phases by the formation energy per atom (Eat. f ), calcu­ lated as  Eat.

A more negative formation energy represents a  higher stability of the concerned phase.
Since the precipitation in binary  Al alloys occurs at temperatures in the range of 100–300 ◦C, we have  also calculated the Helmholtz free energy of formation per atom (Fat. f ),  similarly to LLorca et al.’s definition [28]  Fat.
f = F AlxPty bulk −xFAl bulk −yFPt bulk x + y , (3) The corresponding Helmholtz free energy (F) for each case is  calculated as  F = E −TS, (4)   where E is the energy calculated at 0 K and S is the vibrational entropy  contribution as a function of temperature.
Again, a more negative free  energy of formation represents a greater stability.
Here we have only  considered vibrational contributions to the total entropy since the  configurational entropy can be neglected due to the low content of Pt,  and the electronic entropy is small compared to vibrational entropy even  for transition metals [29].
Fig. 2 shows the calculated formation energies of intermetallic  phases in the binary Al-Pt alloy system.
These agree well with experi­ mental measurements [9], except for an outlier at a concentration of  74.7 at.% Pt.
The Al5Pt phase possesses a formation energy close to the  convex hull, which is in agreement with a previous DFT calculation [11].
Therefore, Al5Pt is a possible stable phase.
Fig. 3 shows changes in the  Helmholtz free energy of formation per atom from 0 K to 1000 K of  selected Al-rich phases in the Al-Pt binary system.
Whereas most phases  become less stable at high temperatures, Al3Pt shows the opposite  behaviour because it is stabilised by entropy at high temperatures.
Therefore, Al3Pt is a possible stable phase at high temperatures.
The  Al5Pt phase has a small energy increment with temperature as seen in  Fig. 3, supporting the previous argument about its stability.  3.2.
The Pt solid solution  Since we are interested in predicting the precipitation behaviour of  Al-rich precipitate phases from a supersaturated solid solution of Pt in Al  matrix, the natural starting point is the determination of Pt solute for­ mation energies and its solubility.
To interpret the results, we also  examine the nature of the electronic interactions between solute and  matrix.
The solute formation energy per solute (Es. f ) can be calculated by  Es.
X f = EAlN−1X bulk −N −1 N EAlN bulk −EX bulk, (5)   where N is the number of atoms in the supercell.
Here, a more negative  value indicates a more stable state of solute X in Al matrix.
We use a 4 × 4 × 4 supercell to avoid any interactions between solute atoms.
Because  Pt shows certain similarities to Cu and Au in the Al matrix as mentioned  earlier, we compare the solute formation energy of Pt to that of group 11  elements including Cu, Ag and Au (see Table 2).
To our knowledge, no  Fig. 1.

Change in the Helmholtz free energy of formation from 0 K to 1000 K of  selected Al-rich phases in the Al-Pt binary system.
Whereas most phases become  less stable at high temperatures as expected, Al3Pt shows the oppo­ site behaviour.
S. Su et al.Acta Materialia 255 (2023) 119048 4 previous work exists for Pt.
Our calculated results for other elements  compare well with previous DFT calculations [31]; the minor discrep­ ancies may be due to the smaller supercell size used in previous work.
We find that Pt has the most negative formation energy amongst all  selected solutes, indicating Pt solute should be stable in Al matrix.
However, the solute formation energy is not directly correlated to the  experimental solubility limit (see Table 2).
This is because ordered  phases will form beyond the solubility limit, and these phases are easier  to form when two elements bind strongly according to the Hume-  Rothery rules [32].
In addition, the formation energy of Pt solute is  calculated at 0 K and misses the significant contribution from the en­ tropy at finite temperatures.
Therefore, to evaluate the solubility of Pt in  Al matrix, we calculate its solubility limit (cs) in Al as a function of  temperature T as [33]  cs = exp (−ΔFs.

excess = F AlxPty bulk −xFAl bulk −y ( FPt bulk + Fs. Pt f ) y . (7) Here ΔFs.
excess is the excess free energy per solute atom, F AlxPty bulk  is the  Helmholtz free energy of the first ordered phase, and kB is the Boltzmann  constant.
Since the solubility limit depends on the first ordered phase,  we have chosen both Al4Pt and Al5Pt as they are the two possible first  ordered phases in the Al-rich region of the Al-Pt phase diagram as dis­ cussed in the previous section.
Fig. 4 shows the calculated solubility limit for Pt in the Al matrix,  with and without the contribution from entropy.
It can be observed that  the entropy significantly affects the solubility limit.
When considering  Al5Pt as the first stable Al-rich phase, the calculated solubility limit of Pt  in the Al matrix at the eutectic temperature is close to the experimentally  measured value (see Fig. 4) [9].
This also suggests that Al5Pt could be  the first ordered bulk phase in the Al-Pt system as indicated in the  previous section.
To quantitatively analyse the solute formation energies and the  electronic interactions between Pt and Al, we calculate the bonding  electron density as  Δρ = ρ −ρIAM, (8)   where ρ is the electron density determined by a self-consistent calcula­ tion after full relaxation, and ρIAM is the electron density based on the  independent atom model.
Fig. 5 presents the bonding electron density in  the (110) plane since the bonding electrons are located in the tetrahedral  holes in Al [34].
We also compare electron densities along 3 directions  with largest magnitude of bonding electron densities (see Fig. 5(b)).
It is  evident that Pt forms the strongest and Ag forms the weakest bond to Al  amongst all 4 alloying elements, in the same order as their solute for­ mation energies: Es. Pt f. < Es. Au f. < Es. Cu f. < Es. Ag f. . 3.3.
Pt clusters and GP zone-like structures in Al matrix  Having investigated the thermodynamics of Pt solute in Al matrix,  the next step is to determine whether clusters or GP zones will form in  the early stages of precipitation, as these will affect the subsequent  formation of precipitate phases [2].
To this aim, we model various  cluster configurations by considering three substitutional Pt/Cu atoms  in a large 4 × 4 × 4 Al supercell.
In the Al-Cu system, a GP zone is a  single Cu layer in Al matrix and θ′′ (GP-II zone) is formed by two Cu  layers separated by 3 Al layers in Al matrix.
Given the similarity between  the Al2X phases in Al-Pt and Al-Cu systems, GP zone like structures in the  Al-Pt system are modelled as one or two infinitely large and mono­ atomically thin Pt layers on the {002} planes and separated by several  {002}Al layers.
The supercell is sufficiently large to represent both GP  zone-like structures and θ′′ -like structures.
For all configurations, we  calculate the excess energy per solute atom relative to Pt solute as  Es.
excess = E AlxPty bulk −xEAl bulk −y ( EPt bulk + Es. Pt f. ) y .
(9)  We also include the data for Cu solute atoms for a comparison with  Pt.
The calculated excess energies for all configurations are shown in  Fig. 6.
We find that the energetically most favourable cluster configu­ rations consist of three nearest neighbour Pt atoms located on (001) or  (111) planes (see Fig. 6(a)).
These planes are the most common pre­ cipitate habit planes in Al alloys [2].
Whereas three coplanar Pt atoms  can exhibit a negative excess energy, a single Pt layer in Al matrix shows  positive excess energies both on (001) and (111) planes (0.07 eV and  0.36 eV, respectively).
The excess energies are positive for all configu­ rations of GP zone like structure for Pt (see Fig. 6(b)).
Two Pt layers on  (001) planes separated by seven layers of Al is more favourable than  other configurations.
In contrast, two Cu layers on (001) separated by  three layers of Al is more favourable than other configurations (i.e.,  identical to θ′′ phase).
When compared with Pt, Cu has negative excess  energies in all configurations of clusters (Fig. 6(a)), GP zones, and θ′′ [36].
Based on these results, we conclude that coherent precipitates such  as GP zones and θ′′ are unlikely form in the Al-Pt binary alloy system.
Large solute clusters of Pt are also unlikely to form since only a limited  number of stable configurations exist.
It should be noted that although  entropy is not considered here, the overall conclusion about clusters, GP  zones and θ′′ in Al-Pt systems will not change as the entropy has a  positive contribution to the excess energy for all configurations.

The eutectic temperatures are 930 K, 830 K,  923 K, and 840 K for Pt, Cu, Au, and Ag respectively.

Precipitate shape and crystallographic relationship with matrix  Precipitate shape and their crystallographic orientations in the ma­ trix have a strong influence on mechanical properties of the binary  alloy—high-aspect-ratio precipitates on low-index planes such as {001}  or {111} tend to be most efficient at blocking stress-induced dislocations  and thus imparting a high strength to the alloy [2].
Such precipitates are  usually coherent with the matrix in one or two dimensions [2], which  means some of their interfaces or edges match well with the matrix.
It is  therefore critical to determine the possible crystallographic relationship  (s) between precipitates and matrix, which will determine the precipi­ tate shape and interfaces.
To do so, we adopt Kelly et al.’s method [37,  38] whereby low-index crystallographic planes in Al and precipitate  structures are compared.
The search was limited to the three most  densely packed planes for each crystal structure, as they are more likely  to result in a good match, and hence low-energy interfaces.
More spe­ cifically, we looked for cases where both interplanar and interatomic  spacings have less than 10% misfit [37], and consequently, a greater  likelihood for the formation of a coherent interface.
Only Al2Pt, Al3Pt  and Al5Pt were found to satisfy these matching conditions.
Fig. 7 shows  the matched planes and the corresponding interfaces between Al2Pt and  Al matrix.
The best match for Al2Pt in Al is for the following crystallo­ graphic relationship: (002)Al2Pt‖(002)Al and (220)Al2Pt‖(200)Al, leading  to a coherent interface (002)Al2Pt‖(002)Al, and two sets of semicoherent  interfaces perpendicular to the coherent interface.
The coherent inter­ face is likely to be much larger than the semicoherent interfaces.
This is  analogous to the case of θ ′ (Al2Cu) and η (Al2Au) precipitates in Al [3,  39].
Based on the orientation relationship determined above, we con­ structed supercells representing an Al2Pt precipitate embedded in the Al  Fig. 5.

When lattice parameters a and b of Al2Pt embedded in Al matrix  are fixed to aAl = 4.04 ˚A to model the coherent interface, the lattice  parameter cAl2Pt/Al is found to increase from 5.94 Å in bulk to 6.27 Å in  the Al matrix.
As shown in Table 3, the formation energy and excess  energy are both negative, suggesting a supersaturated solid solution of  Pt in Al can be expected to decompose into stable Al2Pt precipitates in  the above orientation relationships.
Because non-bulk like interfaces  have been observed within the θ ′ (Al2Cu) structure as a result of Cu  solute segregation, the segregation of Pt into the interfaces of Al2Pt is  considered [40].
Segregation of a Pt atom increases the formation en­ ergy by 0.70 eV, indicating the Al2Pt will displays a bulk like interface  similar to η (Al2Au) rather than θ ′ [40,41].
This is mainly due to the  significantly lower solute formation energy of Pt in Al compared to that  of Cu.
The entropy is not considered when examining interfaces as the  embedded precipitate in our model is small compared to the Al matrix.
The matching of Al3Pt and Al5Pt crystal structures with the Al matrix  was analysed with the same method.
We found that Al3Pt and Al5Pt  precipitates are unlikely to form coherent interfaces because of the  positive excess energies (see Supplementary Information 3).
In sum­ mary, Al2Pt precipitates are likely to have a plate-like shape because of  its 2-dimensional matching to the Al matrix.
This is structurally analo­ gous to η (as already mentioned) and to the θ ′ phase [3].
Al3Pt and Al5Pt  are likely to have equiaxed shapes since no low-energy interface is  found, which is also the case for Al4Pt and Al21Pt8 [42]. 3.5.
Interfacial energies for Al2Pt precipitate in Al matrix  Interfacial energy is a key parameter controlling the shape and  thermodynamics of precipitation.
To calculate the interfacial energy, we  first calculate the formation energies of Al2Pt precipitate supercells with  different size (see Fig. 8).
Then, the interfacial energies between an Al2Pt  precipitate and the Al matrix can be obtained from the slope of the  change in formation energy as a function of supercell size [43,44].
We  use the bulk-like interfaces for θ ′ (Al2Cu), analogous to that of Al2Pt, for  an equivalent comparison.
It can be seen that Al2Pt has a significantly  smaller interfacial energy of 129 mJ/m2 of the coherent interfaces, but a  similar interfacial energy of the semicoherent interfaces when compared  to θ ′ precipitate in Al matrix.
Therefore, Al2Pt precipitates may have a  higher equilibrium aspect ratio than θ ′ precipitate in Al matrix. 3.6.
Mechanical properties  The strain energy associated with the misfit of all precipitate phases  with the Al matrix is the last parameter required as input into our CNT  calculations.
The mechanical properties for all Al-Pt binary phases  considered here are calculated based on DFT [45].

The  coherent interfacial energy of Al2Pt is only a half of that of θ ′.  S. Su et al.Acta Materialia 255 (2023) 119048 7 range of ±1.5% with an increment of 0.5% were applied in all effective  directions according to the crystal symmetry of the binary phase.
Our  results, presented in Table 4, are in good agreement with published  values [46], but display appreciable differences with calculations re­ ported in [11], especially for the shear modulus and Young’s modulus of  Al4Pt and Al2Pt.
The validity of our results is supported by the fact that  mechanical properties calculated for pure Al in our work are closer to  the experimental measurements in our work than in [11].
Notably, high bulk moduli are observed for all presented interme­ tallic phases.
Comparing Al2Pt to other major precipitate phases in Al  alloys, the bulk modulus of Al2Pt is 30% greater than that of θ ′(Al2Cu)  (100 GPa) in the Al-Cu system, and 145% greater than β (Mg2Si) (53  GPa) in Al-Mg-Si alloys [46].
Considering that the plate-like shape of the  Al2Pt precipitate phase and its orientation along the {001}Al planes are  very similar to those of θ ′, these results suggest that Pt additions to  well-known high-strength alloys such as those based on Al-Cu may lead  to precipitates better able to block dislocations and therefore an  improvement in macroscopic high strength. 3.7.
Thermodynamics of precipitate nucleation  Having calculated the interfacial energies and strain energies, we can  now predict the energy change during nucleation, which measures the  likelihood of precipitation of various phases in the Al-Pt binary system.
We have assumed a plate-like shape for the Al2Pt precipitate and a  spherical shape for the remaining binary phases with incoherent in­ terfaces.
By assuming homogeneous nucleation directly from a super­ saturated solid solution, and γ = γAl2Pt semi  for all incoherent spherical  phases, we calculate the thermodynamics of precipitate nucleation  based on the CNT formalism.
Fig. 9 shows the change in total free energy during nucleation of  phases in Al-Pt binary system.
Amongst all phases considered here, Al2Pt  has the lowest nucleation energy barrier and critical radius, indicating it  will be the first phase to precipitate, in agreement with the experimental  observation [19].
Amongst the three smallest thicknesses of Al2Pt nuclei  that we considered, 1 cembedded Al2Pt  is the most favoured thickness according  to our calculations.
This is because the large, favourable chemical po­ tential for Al2Pt to nucleate outweighs the unfavourable contribution of  misfit strain energy due to a greater thickness (see Supplementary In­ formation 4).
Also worth noting is the much smaller critical radius and  barrier to nucleation for Al2Pt compared to θ ′ (Al2Cu) (see Supplemen­ tary Information 4).
Again, this is mainly due to the significantly larger  chemical potential for Al2Pt to nucleate compared with that of θ ′. As  displayed in Table 5, the nucleation temperature has a negligible effect  on the ranking of the nucleation related parameters.
Based on these  calculations, the phases can be ranked in terms of ease of nucleation as:  Al2Pt > Al21Pt8 > Al4Pt > Al5Pt > Al3Pt, with Al2Pt being the easiest  phase to nucleate from the solid solution. 4. Discussion  4.1.
Phases in the binary Al-Pt system  Intermetallic phases with higher Al content than the precipitate  phase (i.e., Al2Pt) are also of interest here because they may form in Al-  rich Al-Pt alloys.
As reflected by studies published to date [7–9,12,13,  18,19,48], it hitherto remains unclear which Al-Pt phases are stable or  metastable.
The full crystal structure of these phases is also not known.
For example, the stable phase with the highest Al concentration is  believed to be Al21Pt5 [9,12,13], even though its full crystal structure is  yet to be determined.
In disagreement with this report, a recent exper­ imental work claimed that the equilibrium phase with the highest Al  content might be Al4Pt [7,8].
Our work supports this view—Al4Pt is  found to have a more negative formation energy per atom (−0.54 eV)  compared to Al21Pt5 (−0.36 eV), and sits close to the convex hull (see  Fig. 2).
Therefore, our work strongly suggests Al4Pt is the most likely  equilibrium phase with the highest Al content.
When exploring the Al-rich part of the Al-Pt phase diagram, we  considered the possible phase Al5Pt (see Section 3.1) as it may compete  with Al4Pt for precipitation.
A metastable phase ε with a composition of  Al5Pt was reported to precipitate first in rapidly quenched Al-Pt alloys.
This phase (ε) was determined to have an atomic volume of 17.05 ˚A 3  [18].
As shown in Section 3.1, we proposed a crystal structure for Al5Pt  Table 4  Mechanical properties including shear modulus (μ),Poisson’s ratio(ν), Young’s  modulus (E) and bulk modulus (K) of selected phases as calculated by DFT, and  compared to reported values.
Our results are in good agreement with the re­ ported values.

Su et al.Acta Materialia 255 (2023) 119048 8 (I4/mcm) and calculated its formation energy, which was found to be  negative and to be slightly above the convex hull similar to previous  calculation [11].
Our proposed crystal structure results in an atomic  volume of 17.09 ˚A 3, which is very close to the experimental value [18].
Therefore, Al5Pt can be considered a plausible candidate for  precipitation.
A metastable phase of composition Al3Pt has also been suggested as a  possible precipitate phase at room temperature [19,20].
More recently,  a high-temperature stable phase denoted ξ and of the same composition  Al3Pt was reported to be stable [7].
Based on DFT calculations for  several possible archetypal structures, we proposed a crystal structure  for Al3Pt with space group Pm3n (see Section 3.1).
For Al3Pt in our work,  we used the most stable structure (i.e. Pm3n) because the full crystal  structure of ξ is still unknown [7].
However, the calculated XRD powder  pattern for Al3Pt (Pm3n) (see Supplementary Information 2) does not  match the XRD pattern of ξ, indicating that the phase characterised in  Ref.
[7] does not have our proposed structure.
Metastable Al6Pt was also  reported in quenched Al-Pt samples [19].
The only crystallographic in­ formation available is that Al6Pt is isostructural with the Ga6Pt structure  with lattice parameters aAl6Pt = 15.762 ˚A, bAl6Pt = 12.103 ˚A and cAl6Pt = 8.318 ˚A [19], but their detailed atomic positions remain unknown [48].
In summary, our work confirms the equilibrium phase on the phase  diagram at this composition is Al4Pt rather than Al21Pt5.
We also suggest  possible crystal structures for Al5Pt and Al3Pt. 4.2.
Precipitation sequence in Al-Pt binary alloys  Several studies have examined precipitation in Al-Pt alloys [7,8,  18–20]; however, all but one [19] deal with precipitation from the melt  rather than solid solution.
In this section, we focus on solid-state pre­ cipitation, which is important for high-strength properties.
First, no GP  zones have been reported to form in Al-Pt alloys, and our DFT results  presented in Section 3.3 also suggests that large clusters and GP zones of  Pt are thermodynamically unstable in Al.
We predict the Al2Pt precipitate phase to adopt an orientation rela­ tionship similar to that of θ ′ and η phase in Al-Cu and Al-Au binary  systems respectively.
This is different from what was proposed in [19]  based on electron diffraction methods.
We found that the orientation  relationship in [19] provides poor matching between DFT relaxed Al2Pt  and Al matrix, in contrast to our proposed orientation relationship.
As  shown in Section 3.7, Al2Pt appears to be the strongest candidate to  precipitate first from the solute solution.
This agrees with early studies  of solid-state precipitation in Al-Pt alloys by Chattopadhyay et al. [19,  49].
This may seem surprising at first, because Al2Pt is in competition  with as many as four phases with much greater Al content, namely:  Al6Pt, Al5Pt, Al4Pt and Al3Pt.
These phases have been observed after  rapidly quenching Al-(2–3)at.% Pt alloys from the melt [18–20].
Indeed,  the Al6Pt phase was reported to precipitate from the solute solution, but  after Al2Pt [19].
Given the full crystal structure of Al6Pt is still not  known, it is difficult to accurately calculate the thermodynamic pa­ rameters for its nucleation such as nucleation energy barrier and critical  radius.
Nevertheless, using crude approximations, we find that Al6Pt is  likely not to precipitate prior to Al2Pt (see Supplementary Information  5).
This is in agreement with Ref. [19].
Regarding the Al5Pt and Al3Pt phases, they contain lattice planes that  match Al matrix planes well.
However, the interfaces that were  considered based on matching these planes were found to be unstable by  DFT.
Although no thermodynamically stable interfaces were found in  this work, a more systematic search may reveal low energy interfaces.
In  this case, Al5Pt and Al3Pt may form prior to Al2Pt (see details in Sup­ plementary Information 6).
However, this situation would contradict  the experimental evidence available to date [18–20]. 4.3.
Effect of bonding electron density on solute formation energy  Our DFT calculation indicated that Pt has a significant negative so­ lute formation energy in Al.
The large bonding electron density between  Al and Pt as shown in Fig. 5 may explain the unfavourable segregation of  Pt into the interfaces of Al2Pt precipitates compared to that of Cu, and  the low coherent interfacial energy of Al2Pt compared to θ ′ (Al2Cu).
Compared to Pt and Cu, the bonding between Al and Ag is weaker than  that between Al atoms, which is consistent with the positive solute  formation energy of Ag in the Al matrix.
The distribution of the bonding  electron density is different for different solute atoms (Cu, Au, Pt, Ag) —  in the case of Pt and Au, bonding is stronger in the 〈110〉directions  compared with Cu and Ag.
This can be correlated with the solute for­ mation energy which is most negative for Pt and Au. 4.4.
Workflow to predict solid-state precipitation in an arbitrary binary  alloy system  Finally, to predict solid-state precipitation in an arbitrary binary  alloy system M-X, where M is the matrix element and X is the solute, we  propose the following systematic workflow.
The first step is to identify  all stable and metastable intermetallic phases known between two  chemical elements based on the equilibrium phase diagram and data­ bases of crystal structures [6].
A precipitate phase is likely to be struc­ turally related to known bulk intermetallic phases, but not always, as is  the case for θ ′ (Al2Cu).
The full crystal structure of each phase must be  known in order to carry out thermodynamics calculations using DFT  methods.
Because some phases are only stable in a certain temperature  range, we need to consider the temperature effect on their stability by  estimating the entropy contribution.
A major challenge here is that some  intermetallic phases are either unknown or have not had their crystal  structure solved.
In this case, one approach is to adopt crystal structures  of phases in similar systems, such as systems between elements in the  same group on the periodic table.
The second step is to determine the solute behaviour of X in M. This  allows for the determination of properties such as solubility, segregation  energy and chemical potential.
These properties are required in the  subsequent steps.
The third step is investigating the interaction of solute atoms,  including the possible formation of clusters and GP zone-like structures.
The main challenge here is to consider all possible configurations of  solute aggregates.
Currently, accurate DFT calculations are limited to  hundreds of atoms, and therefore only up to a handful of solute atoms.
Nevertheless, these methods allow one to explore whether fully coherent  precipitates might exist.
The fourth step is predicting the shape and interfacial structure of  precipitate phases, which is a great challenge.
This requires the orien­ tation relationship(s) between a given precipitate phase and matrix to be  determined.
One approach is to match the crystal structure of the pre­ cipitate phase with the matrix [37,38].
Based on the matched planes, we  can then propose possible low energy interfaces, calculate their inter­ facial energies and misfit strain energies, and suggest the possible shape  of each precipitate phase.
Finally, the last step is to predict the nucleation barrier and critical  size of each precipitate phase, thus allowing the precipitation sequence  to be proposed.
One approach, as used here, involves CNT calculations  using DFT-calculated quantities.
Our CNT calculations are rather crude  with many assumptions especially for the interfacial energies of inco­ herent precipitates.
However, it allows for a qualitatively convincing  investigation of precipitation in the unexplored Al-Pt alloy system. 5.
Conclusion  In this work, we propose a workflow to predict the solid-state pre­ cipitation behaviour in the binary Al-Pt system, based on a combination  of atomistic first principles methods using density-functional theory and  S. Su et al.Acta Materialia 255 (2023) 119048 9 classical nucleation theory calculations.
The bulk intermetallic phases  Al4Pt, Al21Pt8, Al2Pt, Al3Pt2, AlPt (α & β), Al3Pt5, AlPt2 (α & β) and AlPt3  (α & β) are confirmed to be thermodynamically stable.
Our calculations  also support the possible existence of Al5Pt and Al3Pt.
A significantly low  formation energy of Pt in Al is found.
This results in a high energy barrier  for Pt to form clusters, GP zones, and non-bulk interfaces.
When  considering precipitate phases, our calculations strongly suggest that  Al2Pt will adopt a similar orientation relationship and shape to the θ ′ (Al2Cu) phase, and will precipitate first.
Similarly to θ ′, Al2Pt pre­ cipitates are expected to exhibit plate-like shapes with high aspect ra­ tios.
Therefore, the Al-Pt system is an interesting system to study  precipitation strengthening in the Al alloys, which is essential in  developing high-strength aluminium alloys.
Our results are in partial  agreement with previous inconclusive experimental work [19,49], and  motivate further experimental validation through a detailed micro­ scopic characterisation of solid-state precipitation in Al-Pt alloys.
Our  work constitutes an initial step towards predicting solid-state precipi­ tation in an arbitrary Al alloy system, and ultimately, towards the dis­ covery of high-performance Al alloys.
