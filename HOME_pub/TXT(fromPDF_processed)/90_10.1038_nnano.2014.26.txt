Electrically tunable excitonic light-emitting diodes based on monolayer WSe2 p–n junctions Jason S. Ross1, Philip Klement2,3, Aaron M. Jones3, Nirmal J. Ghimire4,5, Jiaqiang Yan5,6, D. G. Mandrus4,5,6, Takashi Taniguchi7, Kenji Watanabe7, Kenji Kitamura7, Wang Yao8, David H. Cobden2 and Xiaodong Xu1,2* The development of light-emitting diodes with improved efﬁciency, spectral properties, compactness and integrability is important for lighting, display, optical interconnect, logic and sensor applications1–8.
Monolayer transition-metal dichal- cogenides have recently emerged as interesting candidates for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical prop- erties9–16.
Electroluminescence has already been observed from monolayer MoS2 devices17,18.
However, the electroluminescence efﬁciency was low and the linewidth broad due both to the poor optical quality of the MoS2 and to ineffective contacts.
Here, we report electroluminescence from lateral p–n junctions in mono- layer WSe2 induced electrostatically using a thin boron nitride support as a dielectric layer with multiple metal gates beneath.
This structure allows effective injection of electrons and holes, and, combined with the high optical quality of WSe2, yields bright electroluminescence with 1,000 times smaller injection current and 10 times smaller linewidth than in MoS2 (refs 17,18).
Furthermore, by increasing the injection bias we can tune the electroluminescence between regimes of impur- ity-bound, charged and neutral excitons.
This system has the required ingredients for new types of optoelectronic device, such as spin- and valley-polarized light-emitting diodes, on-chip lasers and two-dimensional electro-optic modulators.
Few-layer group-VIB transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of semiconductors in the two-dimensional limit9,10,19.
Because of their large carrier effective mass and reduced screening in two dimensions, electron–hole interactions are much stronger than in conventional semiconductors.
This leads to large binding energies for both charged and neutral excitons, which, as a result, are spectrally sharp, robust and amenable to electrical manipu- lation16,20,21.
In addition, the large spin–orbit coupling22 and acen- tric structure of TMDs provides a connection between spin and valley degrees of freedom14, light polarization11,13,15,16 and magnetic and electric ﬁelds23 that can be exploited for new kinds of device operation.
Although in bulk TMDs the bandgap is indirect, in the limit of a single monolayer it becomes direct9,10, fulﬁlling the most basic requirement for efﬁcient light emission.
Indeed, electrolumines- cence has already been reported from monolayer MoS2 ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs), occurring near the Schottky contact with a metal17 or with highly doped silicon18.
However, the efﬁciency and spectral quality was much lower than has been demonstrated in other nanoscale light emitters such as carbon nanotubes7.
There are two reasons for this.
First, efﬁcient electroluminescence requires effective injection of both electrons and holes into the active region, which should therefore be within a p–n junction.
Second, MoS2 is known to have poorer optical quality than other group-VIB TMDs, possibly due to impurities.
In contrast, it has been shown previously that monolayer WSe2 has excellent optical properties16,24.
Here, we demonstrate that combining monolayer WSe2 with a p–n junction architecture using electrostatic doping produces efﬁcient and electrically tunable excitonic light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Figure 1a,b presents a schematic and optical image of a device made by a combination of electron-beam lithography and the trans- fer of exfoliated sheets.
A monolayer WSe2 sheet sits on a sheet of hexagonal boron nitride (BN), typically 10 nm thick, which acts both as a smooth, disorder-free substrate to minimize non-radiative energy relaxation pathways and as a high-quality gate dielectric.
Applying voltages to the two 7 nm palladium gate electrodes beneath the BN can create two separate electrostatically doped regions in the WSe2 separated by a 300-nm-wide undoped strip.
Gold/vanadium (60/6 nm) source and drain contacts were evapor- ated on top.
Importantly, they overlap the gates to reduce the Schottky barriers at the contacts.
For electrical transport measure- ments, a d.c. bias V is applied to one contact (the source) and the current I from the other (the drain) is measured by a virtual-earth current preampliﬁer.
The silicon substrate is grounded.
We start by showing that a p–n junction can be created electro- statically.
First, we set the gate voltages Vg1 and Vg2 to the same value.
Figure 1c shows the current produced with a bias of V ¼ 0.5 V as the gate voltage Vg1 ¼ Vg2 is swept at 60 K (room- temperature measurements are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1).
The current increases rapidly for gate voltages .þ 6.5 V (electron doping) and ,2 6.5 V (hole doping), demonstrating ambipolar operation.
In the inset, the red I–V curve, taken at Vg1 ¼ Vg2 ¼ þ8.0 V, is almost symmetric, as expected for both gated regions being equally electron-doped.
The nonlinearity near zero bias can be associated with the undoped gap between the gates and residual Schottky barriers at the contacts.
In contrast, the blue I–V curve, taken with Vg1 ¼ þ8.0 V and Vg2 ¼ 28.0 V, shows the strong rectiﬁcation behaviour expected for a p–n junction.
The p–n junction can be investigated in detail using scanning optical measurements25,26.

We see a large photocurrent signal localized between the gates, with a peak magnitude of 5 nA. Taking into account the 1% absorption of WSe2 monolayers at 660 nm (ref. 27), the internal quantum efﬁ- ciency reaches a maximum of ≏5%.

The sensitivity of the photodiode can be tuned over a wide range by varying the gate voltages and bias (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Figure 2c presents a corresponding map of the integrated photo- luminescence intensity, which indicates the high optical quality of the whole WSe2 sheet and shows that the luminescence is not sub- stantially quenched by the underlying gates.
More revealingly, Fig. 2d shows a colour map of the peak photoluminescence photon energy, exhibiting two distinct regions clearly correlated with the expected n-doped (blue) and p-doped (red) parts of the WSe2 above the gates.
The reason for this is made clear in Fig. 2e, which shows photoluminescence spectra taken at different pos- itions.
The detailed origin of these spectral features has been estab- lished previously16.
Above the gate held at Vg1 ¼ þ8.0 V (blue trace) the negatively charged X2 trion (two electrons and one hole) dominates, implying an excess of electrons.
Above the other gate, held at Vg2 ¼ 28.0 V (red trace), the higher-energy positively charged Xþ trion (two holes and one electron) dominates, implying an excess of holes.
In the gap between the gates (black trace) the neutral exciton Xo peak can also be seen, consistent with no doping in that region.
Here, the superimposed Xþ and X2 peaks may come from the gated regions, because the laser spot is larger than the gap.
When the device is conﬁgured as a p–n junction (Vg1 ¼ 2Vg2 ¼ 8 V), but not otherwise, we observe bright electroluminescence.
Good spectra can be obtained even at room temperature with a current of 5 nA, as illustrated (blue) in Fig. 3a.
This current is three orders of magnitude smaller than in MoS2 FETs17,18.
In fact, in our best device we observed electroluminescence at an injection current as low as 200 pA (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To understand the nature of the electroluminescence, we superimpose a normalized photoluminescence spectrum of undoped monolayer WSe2 (red).
It is known that the photoluminescence of WSe2 arises from the recombination of direct-gap excitons; thus, the similarity between the electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectra implies that the injected electrons and holes form excitons before recombin- ing radiatively.
This is a natural consequence of the large exciton binding energy due to the strong Coulomb interaction in monolayer TMDs.
Figure 3b presents an image of the total electroluminescence intensity (coloured) superimposed on a simple white-light reﬂection image (greyscale).
It is clear that the electroluminescence emanates from the entire length of the monolayer junction between the two gates.
At low temperatures, the electroluminescence spectrum develops an interesting structure.
Figure 4a shows a plot of electroluminescence intensity as a function of current and photon energy.

The shapes and relative intensities of these fea- tures change with current.
Their origins can be deduced from a comparison with the photoluminescence, the intensity of which is plotted in Fig. 4b as a function of photon energy and common gate voltage Vg ¼ Vg1 ¼ Vg2.
Here we see the tuning of the dominant exciton species as the carrier density is changed by gating16.
The photoluminescence feature that is strongest at Vg ¼ 0 is due to Xo recombination.
It has a similar width to, and is at the same position (1.69 eV) as, the narrow electroluminescence peak, which we there- fore identify as the Xo emission.
The dominant photoluminescence feature at Vg . 0, which shifts from 1.663 eV to 1.625 eV as Vg increases from 0 to þ8 V, is due to X2 (of which there are multiple species16).
The broad electroluminescence feature occurs in the same range of energies, implying that it is dominated by X2.
The dominant feature in the photoluminescence at Vg , 0 is due to Xþ.
This aligns with the high-energy shoulder (grey arrow) on the broad electroluminescence feature at ≏1.670 eV. There is also a band of emission from impurity-bound excitons (XI) in the photo- luminescence, which matches the lower-energy electroluminescence feature centred at 1.59 eV. The ﬁnding that X2 dominates the electroluminescence in Fig. 4a is consistent with the observation that X2 has much stronger photoluminescence than the other exciton species (Fig. 4b).
The shifts of the trion peaks in the photoluminescence with Vg imply that the trion binding energy depends on the perpendicular electric ﬁeld.
Hence, the fact that the width of the broad peak in the electro- luminescence matches the full range of X2 energies in the photolu- minescence is explained by the variation of the perpendicular electric ﬁeld across the junction.
On the other hand, the Xo peak shifts very little with Vg in the photoluminescence and is therefore insensitive to the ﬁeld; thus, the Xo electroluminescence peak is also sharp.
The Xo electroluminescence linewidth is found to be as narrow as 5 meV, which is an order of magnitude smaller than for electroluminescence from MoS2 (refs 1,7).
Figure 4c presents the electroluminescence spectra at selected current values, illustrating sequential population of the excitonic states, which could be due to current pumping or to changes in the electric ﬁeld at the junction under different source–drain biases.
At the lowest current (24 nA), only the excitons with lowest energy (XI and X2) are seen.
At a higher current (27 nA) the Xþ shoulder appears and at 31 nA an Xo peak is also present.
At the highest current (33 nA) we illustrate how the spectrum can be decomposed into four Gaussian peaks.
It is also apparent that the relative strength of the XI peak decreases as the current increases.
The above observations reﬂect complex exciton dynamics, which are not yet fully understood.
Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements have shown that the lifetimes (for radiative and non-radiative processes combined) of the free excitons and the impurity-bound excitons are ≏5 ps and 100 ps respectively28–31 in monolayer MoS2, which we expect to be similar to WSe2.
The elec- tron–hole pair injection rate is 1 e (e is electron charge), which is one pair per 5 ps at 32 nA, comparable to the lifetime of a free exciton but much shorter than that of XI.
Therefore, there could be only of order one free exciton but many impurity-bound excitons present in the junction.
We speculate that that the presence of mul- tiple XI combined with the strong Coulomb interactions enhances non-radiative recombination, which limits the XI emission at higher currents.
Alternatively, the saturation of the XI peak could also be due to the ﬁlling of impurity states, as observed in standard photoluminescence and photocurrent experiments.
We measured the total photon emission rate at the largest applied current of 35 nA to be ≏16 million s21 (Supplementary Note 1).
This is 10 times larger, for 1,000 times smaller current, than reported for MoS2 devices17,18.
It corresponds to one photon per 104 injected electron–hole pairs.
We expect that the overall device efﬁciency could be improved by increasing the injection current for a given voltage by reducing the contact resistance, by improving the WSe2 crystal quality, and by employing improved membrane transfer techniques.
Finally, we mention an important implication of these results.
It has been conclusively demonstrated using polarization-resolved photoluminescence that the excitons in monolayer WSe2 are formed in the+K valleys16.
The excellent match of the electrolumi- nescence with the photoluminescence thus proves that the electro- luminescence also comes from such valley excitons.
In the experiments described here, the injected electrons and holes popu- late both valleys equally, as shown in Fig. 4d, forming excitons in both valleys and thus producing unpolarized light, as we have veriﬁed (Supplementary Fig. 4).
As a result of the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs, where the þK and 2K band edges have opposite spin14, we expect that using ferromagnetic contacts to obtain spin-polarized injection will allow the creation of spin- and valley-LEDs with controllably polarized emission32.
