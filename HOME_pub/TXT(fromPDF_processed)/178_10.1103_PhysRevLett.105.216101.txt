Observation and Destruction of an Elusive Adsorbate with STM: O2=TiO2ð110Þ Philipp Scheiber, Alexander Riss,* Michael Schmid, Peter Varga, and Ulrike Diebold† Institute of Applied Physics, Vienna University of Technology, Wiedner Hauptstrasse 8-10, 1040 Vienna, Austria (Received 6 September 2010; published 15 November 2010) When a slightly defective rutile TiO2ð110Þ surface is exposed to O2 at elevated temperatures, the molecule dissociates at defects, ﬁlling O vacancies (VO) and creating O adatoms (Oad) on Ti5c rows.
The adsorption of molecular O2 at low temperatures has remained controversial.
Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy of O2, dosed on TiO2ð110Þ at a sample temperature of  100 K and imaged at 17 K, shows a molecular precursor at VO as a faint change in contrast.
The adsorbed O2 easily dissociates during the STM measurements, and the formation of Oad’s at both sides of the original VO is observed.

Adsorbed oxygen plays a key role in photocatalysis, both as an electron scavenger and as the oxidative species.
It is important in low-temperature oxidation processes in het- erogeneous catalysis, and its effect on conductivity is central to semiconductor-based gas sensing.
Thus, much effort has been devoted to understanding this interaction in detail [1–20], by using the rutile TiO2ð110Þ surface [21,22] as a model system.
On a stoichiometric TiO2ð110Þ surface, O2 only physisorbs and desorbs below  75 K [15].
This is in agreement with density functional theory-based calcu- lations that predict that excess charge, i.e., O-deﬁcient TiO2, is essential for chemisorption [12,16,23].
A slightly reduced TiO2 sample exhibits two main kinds of defects in the near-surface region: O vacancies (VO) at twofold coor- dinated, ‘‘bridging’’ atoms (Obr) and subsurface Ti inter- stitials (Tiint).
How oxygen adsorbs at room temperature is well understood [1,2,16]: The molecule dissociates at a VO, ﬁlling the vacancy and resulting in an O adatom (Oad) that is singly coordinated to a ﬁvefold coordinated Ti surface atom (Ti5c).
Recently, it has been pointed out that O2 can also dissociate at subsurface Tiint’s, which results in two Oad’s located closely to each other at the same Ti5c row [2].
Oxygen exposure at slightly elevated temperature, where the Tiint’s are more mobile and can migrate to the surface, results in regrowth of excess TiOx in various conﬁgurations [18–20].
STM has been very helpful in unraveling these details of the interaction between O2 and defects on TiO2.
What happens at low temperature is less clear, however.
When O2 is dosed on a cold sample, typically at a tem- perature around 100 K, various desorption techniques— thermal desorption as well as stimulated desorption by electrons or photons—consistently show the formation of a chemisorbed, molecular precursor [3–7].
The O2 mole- cule is negatively charged, likely resembling a peroxide O2 2 or superoxide O 2 ion, and stimulated desorption of this species is hole-mediated [6–9].
One interesting and somewhat mysterious aspect of these experiments, however, is the fact that some of this molecular O2 desorbs at temperatures well above room temperature:  400 K [3,4].
Based on thermal desorption and stimulated desorp- tion by electrons measurements, Kimmel and Petrik [3] postulated the formation of a stable O2 4 species (‘‘tetraoxygen’’) that survives up to these high tempera- tures without dissociating.
To test this prediction and clarify the situation, STM measurements could be quite useful.
So far, however, molecular oxygen on TiO2 was never directly observed with STM.
Here we report low-temperature (17 K) STM results of slightly reduced TiO2ð110Þ surfaces exposed to O2 at 100 K. We provide evidence that O2 is indeed located at VO’s and that it is visible in STM as a rather faint change of the contrast.
The O2 molecule is dissociated by the STM during the measurements even at the smallest tunneling currents applied (4 pA).
We were also able to observe the intermediates of O2 dissociation on TiO2ð110Þ. The experiments were performed on two different rutile TiO2ð110Þ crystals, one from CrysTec and the other one from MTI Corp.
Both were cleaned by repeated cycles of sputtering (2 keV Arþ, ﬂuence of 4  1016 Arþ ions per cm2) and annealing (at 1123 and 923 K, respectively), resulting in a surface VO concentration of  0:17 ML.
Constant current STM measurements have been performed in a two-chamber Omicron UHV system with a base pressure below 2  1011 mbar, at sample temperatures of 17 (liquid He cooled) or 78 K (liquid nitrogen cooled).
Temperatures of less than 17 K resulted in unstable tunnel- ing.
Positive sample bias voltages between 1.3 and 2.4 V were used, and tunneling currents were varied between 0.004 and 0.4 nA. Oxygen dosing was done by backﬁlling the preparation chamber with a pressure of 1  109 mbar.
A series of STM images after dosing 0.045 Langmuirs (L; 1 L ¼ 106 torr s) O2 at 100 K is shown in Fig. 1.
It is well established that the bright and dark lines in empty- state STM images correspond to the rows of Ti5c and bridging oxygen (Obr) atoms, respectively [24], and that VO’s appear as short bright lines that connect two bright PRL 105, 216101 (2010) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 19 NOVEMBER 2010 0031-9007=10=105(21)=216101(4) 216101-1  2010 The American Physical SocietyTi5c lines.
In Fig. 1(a), 58 VO’s are visible; one is marked with a white box.
Reference measurements before O2 adsorption showed that an image of that size should con- tain 120  20 VO’s.
In addition to VO’s, bright, round spots are visible on the Ti5c rows that are clearly identiﬁable as O adatoms; one of these is marked with a circle in Fig. 1(a).
Since (almost) each isolated Oad is representative of an O2 molecule that has dissociated and quenched a VO [2], the numbers of Oad’s and VO’s should add up to 120, the initial vacancy concentration (0.17 ML).
Even when counting the Oad’s partly visible in the image, the actual number, 85, is clearly much less.
The STM image in Fig. 1(a) is streaky in a few places.
This is seen more clearly in the zoom-in [Fig. 1(a1)], taken at the position of the black box.
The streaks—emphasized by arrows in Fig. 1(a1)—are associated with the creation of additional Oad’s, which appear during scanning.
Indeed, the number of Oad’s increases in consecutive STM scans [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)].
Further inspection of Fig. 1(a) shows an additional feature: At some positions, two neighboring bright Ti5c rows appear smeared out and the Obr row between them appears slightly brighter than usual [yellow (bright) arrows].
Figure 2(a) also shows such an area; it seems that an additional, but very faint, species sits on the dark Obr rows.
The apparent height of these features is about  25 pm as shown by the line proﬁle [Fig. 1(a2)], averaged over a few such sites such as the one marked by the black arrows in Fig. 1(a).
For comparison, the Ti5c rows appear 55 pm higher than the Obr rows.
We will now show that these smeared out features are indicative of an O2 at a VO.
In Fig. 1, they are marked with yellow (bright) arrows.
Their number decreases during consecutive scans, while the number of Oad’s increases.
There is a clear correlation between the position of the faint O2 features and the freshly formed Oad’s (dotted circles); each new Oad is located at a Ti5c site next to an O2 in a previous image.
The STM images in Figs. 1 and 2 show yet another new feature: pairs of bright spots, located at adjacent Ti5c rows.
In Fig. 1, these are marked by ovals.
Such pairs of bean- shaped adatoms, which form occasionally when we dose O2 at 100 K, have not been reported before.
(Note that the pairs of Oad’s [2] that form when O2 reacts with a Tiint at FIG. 2 (color online).

In Fig. 2 (a), the smeared out feature (arrow) corresponding to an O2 adsorbed at a vacancy site is still present while the tip scans across it.
[The slow scan direction is þy (up) in all STM images.] When the tip arrives at the scan line marked at the left edge of Fig. 2(a), the Obr row suddenly appears much darker and an adatom materializes on the upper Ti5c row.
Figure 2(b) also shows a second, bean-shaped adatom at the opposite side of the original O2.
The upper O adatom disappears in the next frame in Fig. 2(c) (arrow at the edge).
Adatom mobility is negligible at 17 K, and inspec- tion of the further surroundings shows that this Oad has not jumped to another location.
As soon as the ﬁrst adatom disappears, the remaining one changes from the original bean shape to the ‘‘normal’’ symmetric and round shape.
A few similar cases are marked by ovals and half-ovals in Fig. 1. Density functional theory-based studies of O2 adsorbed on TiO2ð110Þ consistently predict that an O2 2 preferen- tially sits at an VO and that the molecule lies ﬂat with its axis perpendicular to the rows.
Reference [13] reports Tersoff-Hamann plots of a clean, stoichiometric surface and one with an O2 2 in a VO.
These two plots are remark- ably similar to each other, consistent with the claim that the faint, smeared-out features in our STM images are indeed indicative of an O2 in such a conﬁguration.
If this ﬂat-lying O2 suddenly explodes [25], it is conceivable that the re- sulting two O’s will land on the Ti5c atoms adjacent to the VO.
This is a metastable situation, however; a ﬁlled VO and one Oad will be energetically favored.
So one of the Oad’s will migrate back into the now empty VO and ﬁll it up as shown in the schematics in Fig. 2(f).
This process can be induced by the STM tip, as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of partially imaged bean-shaped Oad’s [e.g., Fig. 2(c)].
With the STM we can easily distinguish between an across-the-row, bean-shaped adatom pair that stems from one O2 molecule and a ‘‘pair’’ of two adatoms that have formed independently and sit at adjacent positions on neighboring Ti rows by pure coincidence.
For example, the pairs pointed out in Figs. 1(b1) and 1(b2) have a marked difference in shape and brightness.
In the ﬁrst case, the two adatoms are separated by an VO and in the second case by an Obr.
This affects the apparent height (brightness) of the adatoms.
Interestingly, the image con- trast of the VO between the two Oad’s is also altered.
The gap between the two Oad’s in Figs. 2(b) and 1(b1), at the location where we expect the VO, is quite dark.
This is in contrast to the typical appearance of an isolated VO, which is normally observed as a bright spot on a (dark) Obr row.
The dark VO in between the newly formed Oad pair leads to the bean-shaped appearance alluded to above.
The STM contrast on TiO2 is dominated by electronic effects, and the appearance of this conﬁguration points towards a rearrangement of charge in the vacancy.
Based on the extensive theoretical work of the role of excess charge in oxygen adsorption, it seems also conceivable that the adatoms in these two cases—either with or without a VO between them—do not have the same charge.
The experimental results in Figs. 1 and 2 provide evi- dence that adsorbed molecular O2 is indeed observable with STM, but they also point to the facts that the species is very unstable and that the STM measurement itself is the trigger for most of the dissociation that is observed.
The results shown here have been taken at 17 K. Additional STM measurements at 78 K show essentially the same features, i.e., O2 at VO’s, single Oad’s that suddenly appear during scanning, and Oad pairs resulting from the same O2.
STM-induced dissociation at 78 K is even more facile than at 17 K, however, and in many instances most of the dissociation occurs during the ﬁrst scan of the image.
At either temperature, scanning with ‘‘harsh’’ conditions (Vsample  þ2:4 V, I  0:35 nA) dissociates all O2’s within one single scan, and the density of Oad’s and VO’s approximately equates the number of the original VO’s prior to O2 adsorption.
The effect of the tip is rather localized: When rescanning a slightly shifted area with ‘‘milder’’ conditions, we ﬁnd that the dissociation occurs within a range of less than  1 nm from the location of the tip.
What causes the facile dissociation of adsorbed oxygen molecules during the STM scanning?
Various mechanisms for tip-induced dynamics are discussed in Ref. [26].
If an antibonding orbital can be accessed by the tunneling elec- trons, then the rate of dissociation should scale linearly with the tunneling current I.
If local heating is responsible, the rate should scale as In with a higher value of n. We ran extensive tests, where we varied the tunneling current over more than an order of magnitude (0.004–0.05 nA) but kept all other experimental parameters constant.
We chose a tunneling voltage of 1.3 V, the lowest value where repro- ducible images could be obtained.
While we found a large scatter of the adatom creation range (0:0077 ML=scan, standard deviation 0:0035 ML=scan), the adatom creation rate shows no correlation with the tunneling current.
This clearly rules out an electron-induced process for the oxy- gen dissociation.
As we observe at most a weak depen- dence on the tunneling current, by ignoring van der Waals interactions, the interaction between tip and adsorbed O2 must be due to the electric ﬁeld, which varies with the distance and, hence, the logarithm of the current.
As the change of the shape and composition of the STM tip is not under our control, the local ﬁeld under the STM tip also changes, even when we use the same tunneling voltage, explaining the scatter of adatom creation rate observed.
Hence we propose that the ﬁeld is the decisive factor in how readily an adsorbed O2 dissociates.
Possibly, the STM tip pushes the O2 molecule into a conﬁguration that allows PRL 105, 216101 (2010) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 19 NOVEMBER 2010 216101-3an easy dissociation.
Exactly what this conﬁguration might be is unclear at this point, but we consider it likely that a position closer to a Ti atom in the substrate will facilitate dissociation.
It should be emphasized, however, that the product of any tip-induced process can be observed only when it is (meta)stable on the surface.
In other words, the tip helps overcome a barrier.
We consider it likely that this process also happens spontaneously at higher tempera- tures, and, thus, the observed Oad pairs should be consid- ered the reaction intermediate of O2 dissociation at TiO2ð110Þ. Desorption measurements have shown that the dissocia- tion probability of Oad 2 ’s is coverage-dependent and that small amounts of O2 (the coverage regime of the STM measurements shown here) dissociate more easily than larger coverages [5].
We have varied the O2 exposure in our measurements as well, but we did not observe any new features or any signiﬁcant differences in adatom creation.
Very recent stimulated desorption by photons and thermal desorption work [4] has shown that irradiation with above- band-gap photons not only desorbs O2 (through hole cap- ture) but also dissociates O2 through an electron-mediated process.
In addition, photon exposure was also reported to create a ‘‘photoblind,’’ thermally stable molecular O2 spe- cies [4], which was again attributed to tetraoxygen.
We have searched for such species by dosing higher amounts of O2 and irradiating the sample with a UV-light-emitting diode (365 nm,  1015 photons cm2 s1), but, again, no evidence could be found for such a species.
In summary, we have unequivocally observed molecular O2 adsorbed at oxygen vacancies on TiO2 with low- temperature scanning tunneling microscopy.
Our measure- ments also show the difﬁculty of using STM as an analyti- cal tool for learning more about this species: The STM measurement invariably dissociates the molecule even at the smallest tunneling currents, albeit with a probability that is highly tip-dependent.
While it is fascinating to directly observe this dissociation, it is a nuisance when one wants to learn more about the adsorbed O2 molecule itself.
The STM contrast of an O2 in a VO is so faint that it is easily overlooked in a somewhat noisier instrument.
On the other hand, the creation probability of the O adatoms is tip- dependent; thus, a mere counting of the adatoms needs to be conducted carefully to avoid erroneous conclusions.
