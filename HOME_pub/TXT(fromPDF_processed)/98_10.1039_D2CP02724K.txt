Phys., 2022, 24, 19965 A piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulator VCClBr monolayer with a pure out-of-plane piezoelectric response† San-Dong Guo, *a Wen-Qi Mu,a Hao-Tian Guo,a Yu-Ling Taoa and Bang-Gui Liubc The combination of piezoelectricity with a nontrivial topological insulating phase in two-dimensional (2D) systems, namely piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulators (PQSHI), is intriguing for exploring novel topological states toward the development of high-speed and dissipationless electronic devices.
In this work, we predict a PQSHI Janus monolayer VCClBr constructed from VCCl2, which is dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable.
In the absence of spin orbital coupling (SOC), VCClBr is a narrow gap semiconductor with a gap value of 57 meV, which is diﬀerent from Dirac semimetal VCCl2.
The gap of VCClBr is due to a built-in electric field caused by asymmetrical upper and lower atomic layers, which is further confirmed by the external-electric-field induced gap in VCCl2.
When including SOC, the gap of VCClBr is increased to 76 meV, which is larger than the thermal energy of room temperature (25 meV).
The VCClBr is a 2D topological insulator (TI), which is confirmed by Z2 topological invariant and nontrivial one-dimensional edge states.
It is proved that the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr are robust against strain (biaxial and uniaxial cases) and external electric fields.
Due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, only an out-of-plane piezoelectric response can be observed, when a biaxial or uniaxial in- plane strain is applied.
The predicted piezoelectric strain coeﬃcients d31 and d32 are 0.425 pm V1 and 0.219 pm V1, respectively, and they are higher than or compared with those of many 2D materials.
Finally, Janus monolayer VCFBr and VCFCl (dynamically unstable) are also constructed, and they are still PQSHIs.
Moreover, the d31 and d32 of VCFBr and VCFCl are higher than those of VCClBr, and the d31 (absolute value) of VCFBr is larger than one.
According to out-of-plane piezoelectric coeﬃcients of VCXY (X a Y = F, Cl and Br), CrX1.5Y1.5 (X = F, Cl and Br; Y = I) and NiXY (X a Y = Cl, Br and I), it is concluded that the size of the out-of-plane piezoelectric coeﬃcient has a positive relation with the electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms.
Our studies enrich the diversity of Janus 2D materials, and open a new avenue in the search for PQSHI with a large out-of-plane piezoelectric response, which provides a potential platform in nanoelectronics.
Introduction The discovery of 2D materials has spurred a surge of experi- mental and theoretical interests in understanding their physical and chemical properties.
The piezoelectricity of 2D materials has been a research hotspot in the ever-increasing energy conversion area,1,2 which requires a 2D system to be non-centrosymmetric.
2H-MoS2 is a typical 2D piezoelectric material, which has been confirmed experimentally.3 In theory, the piezoelectric properties of many 2D materials have been reported.4–10 A strong in-plane piezoelectric response is common, while a large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient is rare.
Searching for 2D materials with a large out-of-plane piezoelectric response has become an important quest due to its compatibility with bottom/top gate technologies.
Another interesting feature of 2D systems is non- trivial topology, and their topological insulator is also called a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) with spin-momentum-locked conducting edge states.
The first predicted QSHI was graphene,11 and then the HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells were experimentally confirmed as QSHIs.12,13 Theoretically, many 2D systems have been proposed as QSHIs by first-principles a School of Electronic Engineering, Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi’an 710121, P.

Phys., 2022, 24, 19965–19974 This journal is © the Owner Societies 2022 calculations.14–19 Searching for QSHI with a large gap (larger than 25 meV) is very important for room temperature device applications.
Multifunctional 2D materials are of particular interest due to providing a potential platform for multi-functional electronic devices.
Compared to individual piezoelectricity or nontrivial band topology in a single 2D material, their combination can provide a unique opportunity for intriguing physics and practical device applications.
To search PQSHI, there are two ways: (1) seeking for nontrivial band topology from 2D piezoelectric materials; (2) finding or constructing non-centrosymmetrical QSHI, which may be an executable method, especially for sandwich structures.
It is well known that a sandwich structure can be used as a parent to construct a Janus structure, which lacks an inversion center, giving rise to a piezoelectric eﬀect.20–22 The typical Janus MoSSe monolayer has been experimentally synthesized based on MoS2 with symmetrical upper and lower atomic layers.23,24 However, the nontrivial topology may be broken by building a Janus structure from a QSHI.22,25 The Janus SrAlGaSe4 and MoSSe as derivatives of QSHI SrGa2Se4 and 1T0-MoS2 lose nontrivial topology.
However, strain can make them possess the topological properties of their parents.22,25 Recently, based on VOCl as a prototype, 20 2D monolayers VXY (X = B, C, N, O and F; Y = F, Cl, Br and I) are predicted by means of first-principles calculations.26 They possess emerging topological, magnetic or dielectric properties, which depend on electron occupation, ligand electronegativity and crystal field strength.
The calculated results demonstrate that the VCY systems exhibit nontrivial topological properties.26 Their crystal structure possesses central symmetry, which leads to disap- peared piezoelectricity.
However, this structure can be regarded as a sandwich structure.
These provide a possibility to induce PQSHI by constructing a Janus structure based on a VCY monolayer as the parent.
In this work, we build a Janus crystal structure VCClBr, which can be obtained by replacing the top Cl layer in the VCCl2 monolayer with Br atoms.
The calculated results show that VCClBr indeed is a PQSHI with dynamical, mechanical and thermal stabilities.
It is proved that the nontrivial band topology of VCClBr is robust against strain and an external electric field.
The calculated out-of-plane piezoelectric response is stronger than those of many 2D materials,5,7 like Janus transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers.
Finally, by analysing out-of- plane piezoelectric coeﬃcients of VCXY (X a Y = F, Cl and Br), CrX1.5Y1.5 (X = F, Cl and Br; Y = I)27 and NiXY (X a Y = Cl, Br and I),27 the strong out-of-plane piezoelectric response can be obtained by constructing a Janus monolayer with a large electro- negativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms.
Our studies highlight multifunctionalities of Janus VCClBr, which is promising for applications in the next-generation topotronic and piezoelectric devices.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we shall give our computational details.
In the next few sections, the crystal structure and stability, electronic structures and piezoelectric properties of the Janus monolayer VCClBr are shown.
Finally, our discussion and conclusions are given.
Computational detail We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations29 using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), with a projected augmented wave method.30–32 The total energy con- vergence criterion and cutoff energy for plane-wave expansion are set to 108 eV and 500 eV, respectively.
The exchange- correlation potential is adopted within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof.33 Furthermore, a Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screened hybrid func- tional (HSE06)34 is also employed to confirm nontrivial topol- ogy.
The spin orbital coupling (SOC) is included to investigate the electronic structures and topological properties of VCClBr.
To sample the Brillouin zone (BZ), a Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 16  13  1 is adopted for geometry optimization, and the residual force on each atom is required to be less than 0.0001 eV Å1.
To eliminate spurious interactions with its periodic images, a vacuum region of more than 18 Å is adopted in the direction perpendicular to the VCClBr monolayer.
The phonon dispersion spectra are obtained by a finite displacement method with a supercell of 5  5  1, as implemented in the Phonopy code.35 To calculate the second order interatomic force constants (IFCs), a 2  2  1 k-mesh is employed with a kinetic energy cutoﬀof 500 eV. The elastic stiﬀness tensor Cij and piezoelectric stress coeﬃcients eij are obtained by using the strain–stress relationship (SSR) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method,36 respectively.
The 2D elastic coefficients C2D ij and piezoelectric stress coefficients e2D ij have been renormalized by the length of the unit cell along the z direction (Lz):5,7 C2D ij = Lz C3D ij and e2D ij = Lz e3D ij .
A 16  13  1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh is adopted to calculate Cij and eij by using GGA.
WannierTools code37 is used to calculate the surface state and Z2 topological invariant, based on the tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions by employing d-orbitals of V atoms and p-orbitals of C, Cl and Br atoms, as implemented in the Wannier90 code.38 Crystal structure and stability As shown in Fig. 1(a and b), the middle VC layer of VCClBr is sandwiched by Cl and Br layers, which can be considered a Janus structure.
The Janus monolayer MoSSe has been experi- mentally achieved from MoS2 by replacing one of the two S layers with Se atoms.23,24 With similar experimental techniques, the VCClBr can be constructed by replacing the top Cl atom layer in the VCCl2 monolayer with Br atoms.
Its each V atom is 6-fold coordinated with four C, one Cl and one Br atom, giving rise to a strongly distorted octahedron unit.
The symmetry of VCClBr (No. 25) is lower than that of VCCl2 (No. 59) due to the lack of horizontal mirror symmetry.
Namely, the VCCl2 has centrosym- metry with disappeared piezoelectricity, while the VCClBr lacks inversion symmetry, possessing piezoelectricity.
The optimized lattice constants of VCClBr are a = 3.257 Å and b = 3.959 Å. Due to the diﬀerent atomic sizes and electronegativities of Cl and Br atoms, inequivalent bond lengths can be observed, for example Paper PCCP Published on 03 August 2022.

Phys., 2022, 24, 19965–19974 |  19967 dCl–V = 2.449 Å and dBr–V = 2.575 Å, which can induce an electrostatic potential gradient, giving rise to a built-in electric field.
To validate its dynamic stability, the phonon dispersions of VCClBr are calculated, which is plotted in Fig. 1(c).
No imaginary vibrational frequency with three acoustic and fifteen optical pho- non branches is observed, suggesting that VCClBr is dynamically stable.
In addition, by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, the thermal stability of VCClBr with a supercell of 4  4  1 for more than 8000 fs at 300 K is examined.
The total energy fluctuations as a function of simulation time along with the final configurations are plotted in Fig. 1(d).
The calculated results show that VCClBr undergoes no structural reconstruction with small energy fluctuations, indicating its thermal stability.
To further check the mechanical stability of VCClBr, its elastic constants are calculated.
When only the in-plane strain and stress (strain ejk = 0 and stress sij = 0 for i = 3 or j = 3) are taken into account, by using Voigt notation, the elastic tensor with mm2 point-group symmetry can be written as: C ¼ C11 C12 0 C12 C22 0 0 0 C66 0 B B B @ 1 C C C A (1) The calculated C11 = 130.67 N m1, C22 = 215.81 N m1, C12 = 17.08 N m1 and C66 = 53.45 N m1.
The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born criteria of mechanical stability: C11 4 0, C22 4 0, C66 4 0, C11  C12 4 0 (2) Therefore, VCClBr is mechanically stable.
Since the C11 and C22 of VCClBr are very diﬀerent, the anisotropy of its Young’s moduli C2D(y) and Poisson’s ratios n2D(y) should be very distinct.
The direction-dependent C2D(y) and n2D(y) can be obtained by the following two formulas:39,40 C2DðyÞ ¼ C11C22  C122 C11m4 þ C22n4 þ B  2C12 ð Þm2n2 (3) n2DðyÞ ¼ C11 þ C22  B ð Þm2n2  C12 m4 þ n4   C11m4 þ C22n4 þ B  2C12 ð Þm2n2 (4) where the y is the angle of direction with the x/y direction defined as 01/901, m = sin (y), n = cos (y) and B = (C11C22–C12 2)/ C66.
As plotted in Fig. 2, the C2D(y) and n2D(y) of VCClBr show very strong anisotropy.
The C2D is 129.32/213.58 N m1 along the x/y direction, and 0.079/0.131 for n2D. Electronic structures The energy band structures of VCClBr by using GGA and GGA + SOC are plotted in Fig. 3.
In the absence of SOC, the VCClBr is a direct gap semiconductor with the gap of 57 meV, and the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at one point along the G–Y path.
It can clearly be seen that very strong anisotropy is observed for energy band Fig. 1 For Janus monolayer VCClBr, the (a) top view and (b) side view of the crystal structure, and the primitive cell is marked by black frames; (c) the phonon band dispersions by using GGA; (d) the total energy fluctuations as a function of simulation time at 300 K, and the insets show the final structures (top view (a) and side view (b)) of VCClBr after 8 ps at 300 K.

When including SOC, the VCClBr is still a direct gap semiconductor, and the gap increases to 76 meV.
The previous calculated results show that VCCl2 is a QSHI.26 The Janus monolayer SrAlGaSe4 as a derivative of centrosymmetric QSHI SrGa2Se4 is a normal insulator, which can be reverted by strain.22 However, Janus monolayer CSb1.5Bi1.5 still maintains nontrivial topological properties from QSHI CX3 (X = Sb and Bi) with inversion symmetry.41 To confirm the topological properties of VCClBr, the Z2 topological invariant is calculated.
For a material with inversion symmetry, Z2 topological invariant can be obtained from the product of parities of all occupied states at four time-reversal-invariant-momentum points in the 2D BZ.
However, VCClBr is non-centrosymmetrical, and the Z2 can be verified by the calculation of a Wannier charge center (WCC).42 If Z2 equals 1/0, a material is a topologically nontrivial/ trivial state.
As plotted in Fig. 4, an arbitrary reference line crosses the evolution lines of WCC an odd number of times, giving rise to Z2 = 1, which indicates that VCClBr is a QSHI.
Furthermore, a QSHI should exhibit non-trivial topological edge states.
To simu- late the topological edge states, we construct a nanoribbon (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†), and the 2D BZ of VCClBr and projected edge BZ for nanoribbons together with high symmetry points are also plotted in Fig. 1 of the ESI.† We further calculate one- dimensional edge states based on the tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, which are plotted in Fig. 4.
It is clearly seen that topological helical edge states connect the conduction and valence bands and cross at a Dirac cone.
The HSE06 is also employed to check the reliability of the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr.
Within HSE06 + SOC, the energy band structure and one-dimensional edge states are plotted in Fig. 5.
The calculated results show that the gap of VCClBr increases to 87 meV from 76 meV with GGA + SOC, and the nontrivial topological properties are still kept with topological helical edge states.
The VCCl2 is a Dirac semimetal without considering SOC, and no opened gap is observed.26 Compared to VCCl2, VCClBr lacks horizontal mirror symmetry, possessing a built-in electric field, which induces the opened gap.
To confirm this, we apply an external electric field (E) perpendicular to the VCCl2, which should induce a gap.
Since the electric field is a vector (not a pseudovector), the horizontal mirror symmetry will be broken by an electric field.
This is diﬀerent from the magnetization as a pseudovector, which preserves the horizontal mirror symme- try.
Thus, applying an external electric field can be used to simulate a Janus structure (see Fig. 6) in a sense.
For the VCCl2 monolayer, the evolution of band gap as a function of applied electric field is provided in Fig. 7 by using GGA and GGA + SOC, and the representative energy bands under the 0.00 eV Å1 and 0.04 eV Å1 electric field are plotted in Fig. 8.
In the absence of SOC, the band gap increases monotonously from 0 meV with increasing electric field for VCCl2.
This implies that the applied electric field can induce the gap for VCCl2, which is equivalent to a built-in electric field by constructing a Janus structure, like VCClBr.
For example a 0.04 eV Å1 electric field, the gap of VCCl2 is 73 meV without considering SOC, and the GGA + SOC gap is reduced to 67 meV.
It is noted that the gap with GGA + SOC is larger than the one with GGA under a small electric field, and then the opposite situation is observed with a sequentially increasing electric field.
Finally, the edge states are calculated within the considered E range.
It is found that the nontrivial topological properties of VCCl2 are robust against an applied electric field, and the representative topological helical edge states under a 0.40 eV Å1 electric field are plotted in Fig. 2 of the ESI.† The electric field eﬀects on electronic and topological properties of VCClBr are also investigated.
Janus VCClBr has diﬀerent atomic species on its upper and lower facets (see Fig. 6), which means that applying +z and z directional electric fields are not equivalent.
This is diﬀerent from VCCl2, which has the same atomic species on its upper and lower facets (see Fig. 6), giving rise to equivalent eﬀects caused by applying both +z and z directional electric fields.
The energy band gaps of the VCClBr monolayer as a function of applied electric field along +z and z directions by using GGA + SOC are plotted in Fig. 7.
The gap increases with increasing +z directional E, while increasing z directional E reduces the gap.
However, the gap change is very small with E from 0.00 eV Å1 to 0.40 eV Å1, and only 5.1/3.6 meV for +z and z directional E, which is much smaller than the one (37.3 meV) of VCCl2.
It is also proved that the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr are robust against an applied electric field.
Strain is an eﬀective method to tune the electronic properties of 2D systems, and further aﬀects their topological properties.43–45 Here, both biaxial and uniaxial strains are con- sidered to investigate the robustness of the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr.

The L/L0 o 1 (L/L0 4 1) means compressive (tensile) strain.
For biaxial strain, the a and b lattice parameters simultaneously change, and atomic positions are allowed to relax.
For uniaxial strain, the a/b lattice parameter changes, and the b/a lattice parameter and atomic positions are allowed to relax in response to an applied in-plane uniaxial strain.
The electronic structures versus L/L0 are calculated by using GGA + SOC.
The variation of band gaps with biaxial, uniaxial-a and uniaxial-b cases are plotted in Fig. 7, and the energy band structures at representative applied strain are shown in Fig. 9.
For biaxial strain, with increasing strain, the gap firstly increases, and then decreases, which is due to the transition of CBM from one point along G–S to one point along G–Y. It is found that both compressive and tensile strains can induce semiconductor-metal transitions, which are due to the varia- tion of CBM and VBM.
Our calculated results show that the nontrivial topological properties are robust within the consid- ered strain range.
For 0.96 or 1.04 strain, VCClBr is a metal, but the gap along the G–Y path is still maintained, and topological helical edge states still exist (see Fig. S3 of the ESI†).
Partly, the uniaxial-a compressive/tensile strain is equivalent to a uniaxial- b tensile/compressive one, which can be confirmed by their gaps versus L/L0.
It is found that uniaxial strain can also induce the change of CBM or VBM, giving rise to nonmonotonic Fig. 4 For the VCClBr monolayer, (a) the nontrivial topological edge states, and the color scale means the weight of the electron spectral function.

Semiconductor-metal transi- tions can also be observed at uniaxial-a 0.96 strain.
However, the gap along the G–Y path always exists.
The topological helical edge states can always be observed with the considered uniaxial strain range, which are plotted in Fig. S4 and S5 of the ESI† at 0.96 and 1.04 strains.
Piezoelectric properties For a noncentrosymmetric material, an applied strain or stress can induce electric dipole moments and produce electricity, called the piezoelectric eﬀect.
The pristine VCCl2 is non-piezoelectric, while VCClBr with a particular Janus structure possesses a piezo- electric eﬀect.
The third-rank piezoelectric stress tensor eijk and strain tensor dijk can be used to describe the piezoelectric response of a material.
The relaxed piezoelectric tensors (eijk and dijk) are obtained as the sum of ionic and electronic contributions: eijk ¼ @Pi @ejk ¼ eelc ijk þ eion ijk (5) and dijk ¼ @Pi @sjk ¼ delc ijk þ dion ijk (6) where Pi, ejk and sjk are the polarization vector, strain and stress, respectively, and the superscripts elc and ion mean electronic and ionic contributions.
The eelc ijk and delc ijk (eijk and dijk) are also called clamped-ion (relax-ion) piezoelectric coeﬃcients.
The eijk and dijk can be connected by elastic tensor Cmnjk: eijk ¼ @Pi @ejk ¼ @Pi @smn :@smn @ejk ¼ dimnCmnjk (7) For 2D materials, these conditions (eij = sij = 0 for i = 3 or j = 3) are assumed, which implies that only the in-plane strain and stress are taken into account.
However, the polarization can be allowed to remain out-of-plane.
We define the in-plane directions x1 and x2 as the short edge and long edge direction of the primitive cell, and x3 as perpendicular to the 2D layer.
Employing Voigt notation, the piezoelectric stress and strain tensors due to mm2 point group symmetry (ejk = sij = 0 for i = 3 or j = 3) can be reduced into: e ¼ 0 0 0 0 0 0 e31 e32 0 0 B B B @ 1 C C C A (8) Fig. 7 Top plane: The energy band gaps of VCCl2 monolayer as a function of applied electric field by using both GGA and GGA + SOC; middle plane: the energy band gaps of the VCClBr monolayer as a function of applied electric field along +z (up) and z (dn) directions by using GGA + SOC.

Moreover, with the applied biaxial in-plane strain, the superposed out-of-plane polar- ization will arise (d31 a 0 and d32 a 0).
The e31 and e32 can be directly calculated by DFPT, and the d31 and d32 can be derived by eqn (1) and (7)–(9): d31 ¼ e31C22  e32C12 C11C22  C122 (10) d32 ¼ e32C11  e31C12 C11C22  C122 (11) The calculated e31 (e32) is 0.593  1010 C m1 (0.545  1010 C m1) with ionic part 0.019  1010 C m1 (0.032  1010 C m1) and electronic part 0.612  1010 C m1 (0.513  1010 C m1).
The electronic and ionic polarizations of e31 have opposite signs, while they have the same signs for e32.
However, the electronic contribution dominates the piezoelectricity of both e31 and e32.
Based on pe2-0 and pe2-1, the d31 and d32 can be obtained from previously calculated Cij and eij.
The calculated d31 (d32) is 0.425 pm V1 (0.219 pm V1), which is higher when compared with those of other 2D materials.5,7 The d31 is almost twice as large as d32, which is mainly due to very diﬀerent C11 and C22.
Thus, VCClBr is a potential PQSHI.
Discussions and conclusion The VCY2 (Y = F, Cl, Br and I) monolayers have been predicted to be topological Dirac semimetals without SOC.26 However, for VCI2 the Fermi level deviates from the Dirac point.
Thus, based on VCY2 (Y = F, Cl and Br) monolayers, we constructed another two Janus monolayer VCFBr and VCFCl of VCXY (X a Y = F, Cl and Br).
The optimized lattice constants a and b are listed in Table 1.
It is found that a increases with the size of X and Y anions (from VCFCl to VCFBr to VCClBr), while b is less aﬀected, which is because the X and Y anions are directly bonded to V atoms along the x direction.
The energy band structures of VCFBr and VCFCl within SOC are plotted in Fig. 10.
The calculated results show that VCFCl and VCClBr are direct gap semiconductors, while VCFBr is an indirect gap Fig. 9 The energy band structures of VCClBr with SOC at the representative applied strain, including biaxial (top panel), uniaxial-a (middle panel) and uniaxial-b (bottom panel) cases.

The CBM of VCFBr is at one point along the G–S path, while the VBM is located at one point along the G–Y path.
For VCFCl and VCClBr, both CBM and VBM are located at one point along the G–Y path.
As summarized in Table 1, the gap increases with the size of X and Y anions (from VCFCl to VCFBr to VCClBr).
It is clearly seen that topological helical edge states connect the valence and conduction bands of VCFBr and VCFCl (see Fig. 11), confirming their nontrivial topological properties.
For monolayer VCClBr, VCFBr and VCFCl, the calculated elastic constants Cij, piezoelectric stress coeﬃcient eij along with electronic and ionic parts, and piezoelectric strain coeﬃ- cient dij are listed in Table 2.
For these monolayers, the calculated elastic constants satisfy mechanical stability criteria, confirming their mechanical stabilities.
For all these mono- layers, the electronic and ionic contributions of e31 have opposite signs, while they have the same signs for e32, and the electronic part dominates e31 and e32.
For the three mono- layers, the d31 is larger than d32.
The d31 and d32 of VCFBr are the largest among these monolayers, which may be due to the very diﬀerent electronegativities of F and Br atoms compared with F and Cl or Cl and Br atoms.
The d31 and d32 (absolute value) of VCXY (X a Y = F, Cl and Br) along with the electro- negativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms are plotted in Fig. 12.
A similar phenomenon can be found in monolayer CrX1.5Y1.5 (X = F, Cl and Br; Y = I) and NiXY (X a Y = Cl, Br and I),27,28 and their d31 along with the electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms are also plotted in Fig. 12.
It is clearly seen that the large electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms is related to the large out-of-plane piezoelectric response.
It is noted that the d31 of VCFBr is larger than 1.0 pm V1, which is rare for out-of- plane piezoelectric responses of 2D systems.
Finally, the pho- non dispersions of VCFBr and VCFCl are calculated, which are plotted in Fig. S6 of the ESI.† Unfortunately, the two mono- layers are dynamically unstable due to existing imaginary frequencies.
However, these comparisons provide some thoughts and scientific basis for searching for a large out-of- plane piezoelectric response in Janus 2D materials.
In summary, we have demonstrated coexistence of piezo- electricity and robust nontrivial band topology in the Janus VCClBr monolayer with dynamical, mechanical and thermal stabilities based on the reliable DFT calculations.
The nontri- vial band topology in the Janus VCClBr monolayer is confirmed by topological helical edge states, which is robust against strain and an external electric field.
Only an out-of-plane piezoelectric response exists due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry.
The predicted out-of-plane d31 and d32 are higher than or compar- able with ones of many 2D known materials, which is highly desirable for ultrathin piezoelectric devices.
It is found that the elastic, electronic and piezoelectric properties of the VCClBr monolayer show very strong anisotropy due to the Cl and Br anions directly bonded to V atoms along the x direction.
Our predicted VCClBr provides a possible platform for the future Fig. 10 The energy band structures of VCFCl and VCFBr monolayers by using GGA + SOC.
