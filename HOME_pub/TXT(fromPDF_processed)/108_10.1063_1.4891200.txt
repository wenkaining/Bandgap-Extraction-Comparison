For certain growth conditions, we observe micron-size island-like impurity layers which can be mistaken for second graphene layers in optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy.
The island orientation depends on the crystalline orientation of the Pt, as shown by electron backscatter diffraction, indicating growth of carbon at the platinum surface below graphene.
Dark-ﬁeld transmission electron microscopy indicates that in addition to uniform single-crystal graphene, our sample is decorated with nanocrystalline carbon impurities with a spatially inhomogeneous distribution.
The impurity concentration can be reduced signiﬁcantly by lowering the growth temperature.
Raman spectra show a large D peak, however, electrical characterization shows high mobility (8000 cm2/Vs), indicating a limitation for Raman spectroscopy in characterizing the electronic quality of graphene.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4891200] INTRODUCTION Platinum was recently developed as a catalytic substrate metal for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of graphene.1 While copper, another promising and widely used catalytic metal, requires low-pressure synthesis conditions2 to produce large (>100 lm) single-crystal monolayer graphene, Pt sub- strates enable large grain graphene with ambient-pressure growth conditions.
The electrolysis transfer method1 can remove graphene synthesized on Pt so that the graphene is free of metal and etchant residues.
Particularly, the melting point of Pt, 1768 C, is 683 C higher than that of Cu, 1085 C, providing an opportunity to study carbon deposition at high temperature.
There are also intriguing phenomena observed for graphene grown on Pt, such as sizable (10 lm) multi-layer graphene pyramids and wrinkles twisting gra- phene from Bernal stacking to rhombohedral stacking.3 However, Pt-synthesized graphene has not been investi- gated extensively.
Here, we characterize graphene synthesized on Pt at 1000 C (see Methods) with optical microscopy, scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffrac- tion (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements.
We identify novel carbon impurity structures that have not been observed in graphene synthesized on other metals.
These impurities consist of nano- crystalline sp2 carbon, and can cause considerable confusion in characterizing the layer number and defect concentration by conventional methods.4 We ﬁnd that the incidence of such nanocrystalline carbon impurities can be greatly reduced by growth at lower temperature.
RESULTS Figure 1(a) shows a SEM micrograph of a graphene sample on Pt foil synthesized at 1000 C (sample 1; see Methods), and Figure 1(b) shows an optical micrograph of the sample after transfer to SiO2/Si.
As will be shown below, monolayer graphene covers the whole surface, but optical and SEM micrographs show few-micron-sized islands of increased contrast.
Characterization of graphene on the Pt substrate via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows no FIG.

The size, morphology, and conﬁguration of the islands, as shown in Figure 1(a), depend on the crystalline orientations of the Pt substrate grains which are distin- guished by contrast in SEM images due to the tunneling effect of the secondary electrons.
Such correlation is investi- gated further via EBSD below in Figure 2.
Typically, graphene is transferred onto silicon dioxide substrates facing the same direction as it is on Pt, i.e., the side originally touching the metal surface touches the silicon dioxide surface after transfer.
Imaging the topography of graphene transferred in this “normal” way requires removal of the transfer support, typically poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), in which case PMMA residue contaminates the graphene.
To investigate the topography of graphene grown on Pt without exposing the surface to be probed to PMMA, we use an “up-side-down” transfer method: we transfer the graphene/PMMA stack to SiO2/Si with the graphene on top, and do not remove the PMMA.
Figure 1(c) shows an AFM image of graphene/PMMA transferred by the “up-side-down” method.
The surface being imaged has had no contact with PMMA.
Islands simi- lar in morphology to those seen in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) can be identiﬁed in the AFM image with height of about 0.35 nm to more than 1 nm.
We also observed two types of wrinkles in graphene transferred by this method: raised wrinkles which were valleys in graphene on the Pt growth substrate and may represent the Pt metal grain boundaries, and indented wrinkles which were raised when graphene was on Pt, and likely arose from the differential thermal expansion between graphene and Pt.5 Such narrow wrinkles are not the conse- quence of the transfer process as graphene adheres tightly to the 300 nm thick PMMA and only wrinkles close to that scale can result from transfer.
We identify the orientations of monocrystal Pt via EBSD and image the island layers grown on corresponding Pt grains via SEM.
Crystalline orientations can be com- pletely described by either the combination of plane direc- tion and crystal direction {h k l}hu v wi or Euler angles (/1, U, /2).
Index {h k l} represents atomic arrangements on the cleavage surface, the last Euler angle, /2, represents rota- tion of the crystal in the plane of cleavage surface with respect to the reference direction (RD), provided that Bunge’s (passive) description is used.
As an example given in Figure 2, maps of inverse pole ﬁgure (IPF), Figure 2(b), and Euler angles, Figure 2(c), are shown for three monocrys- tals A, B, and C as in Figure 2(a).
Given {h k l} and /2, we obtain the top-view of the crystals shown in Figures 2(g)–2(i).
We deﬁne a direction in the cleavage face along the most exposed atoms on the top layer, representing the anisotropy of this facet.
We found that the deﬁned direction coincides with the longitudinal axis of the impurity layers, if there is one.
For cleavage faces lacking such an axis, as in case A of Figure 2(d), the impurity layers do not show obvious anisot- ropy.
Thus, the anisotropy of the crystal face does relate with that of the morphology of the impurity layers. This FIG. 2.
The SEM image (a) shows platinum substrate with three grains A, B, and C of different orientations, whose IPF map and Euler angles map are shown in (b) and (c).
The plane direction {h k l} and the last Euler angle /2 are shown in the correspond- ing map.
The atomic arrangements are shown, respectively, in (g), (h), and (i) below detailed SEM images in (d), (e), and (f) marked with the directions of exposed atom rows, if they exist, as deﬁned in the text.
The angles formed by the axes and the RD are also shown in the SEM images to guide eyes.

The correlation between impurity island morphology and Pt grain orientation strongly suggests that the impurities are formed at the Pt surface, underneath the continuous graphene.
As powerful tools for nanoscale characterization, espe- cially, in cases where Raman spectroscopy6 is ambiguous, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and dark ﬁeld imaging via transmission electron microscope were used to identify layer-number and stacking-sequence in graphene.3,7 SAED provides grain orientations;3 corresponding dark ﬁeld images provide maps of grains and stacking sequence.7–9 Speciﬁcally, contrast in the second order dark ﬁeld image is sufﬁcient to identify layer-number variation.7 The graphene samples were transferred onto 10 nm thick silicon nitride membranes.
Figure 3(a) is a bright-ﬁeld TEM image of the sample showing an island similar to those seen in Figure 1.
Figure 3(b) shows the corresponding electron diffraction pattern.
The diffraction pattern contains (1) bright main spots corresponding to monolayer graphene, (2) a dif- fuse background from the amorphous Si3N4 membrane, and (3) sharp rings at the same radius as the monolayer graphene spots, with varying intensity along the rings, including some discrete spots.
The pattern of intensity variation along the ﬁrst-order and second-order rings has six-fold symmetry; the wave vector and symmetry of the sharp rings is entirely con- sistent with graphene indicating that the rings originate from crystalline graphitic carbon.
Note that the possibility of the existence of additional carbon adatoms and/or nano-size iso- lated amorphous carbon cannot be excluded as these would be difﬁcult to detect in diffraction.
Dark ﬁeld images of the ﬁrst-order (Figure 3(c)) and second-order (Figure 3(d)) gra- phene diffraction spots are fairly uniform indicating that a monolayer of graphene corresponding to the main diffraction spots covers the whole image area.
The second-order dark ﬁeld image (Figure 3(d)) demonstrates that overwhelming majority of the additional material in the island region does not share the same orientation with the background mono- layer graphene, though there are minority parts with a radial conﬁguration and sizes ranging from nm to 100 nm that do align with the continuous monolayer.
This observation is in contrast with crystalline bilayer graphene impurities in gra- phene grown on Cu,10 Ni,11,12 and Fe,13 often hardly Raman- detectable due to their small sizes.
Figure 3(e) shows an additional dark-ﬁeld TEM image, with a larger aperture to include many diffraction spots on the sharp second-order ring.
Here, dark ﬁeld TEM shows bright domains distributed inhomogeneously throughout the whole surface.
The correspondence between the dark region in the bright ﬁeld image Figure 3(a) and bright region in the dark ﬁeld image Figures 3(d) and 3(e) conﬁrms that the bright domains in Figures 3(d) and 3(e) mainly represent car- bon impurities as an additional layer rather than crystalline defects in the continuous monolayer.
This is the major ﬁnd- ing of this paper: nanocrystalline graphene, misoriented with respect to the underlying continuous monolayer graphene, exists across the entire sample.
The impurity graphene is inhomogeneously distributed, with a higher concentration in few-micron-sized island regions, but concentrations also detected outside the islands.
This is consistent with what we observed by optical microscope and AFM.
We now turn to Raman spectroscopy of our Pt-grown graphene samples, using a 633 nm laser excitation source and a confocal microscope to map the Raman spectra at the submicron scale.
Figure 4(a) (inset) shows a typical Raman spectrum of graphene grown on Pt similar to those examined FIG.

It is imme- diately evident that the Raman spectrum for the Pt-grown graphene with carbon impurities is distinct from that reported for exfoliated graphene6 or Cu-grown CVD gra- phene shown here or reported before.2 The Pt-grown gra- phene exhibits a pronounced and extremely wide D peak and broad wings to the G peak.
The spectrum could be consistent with the superposition of a graphene spectrum (with sharp G and 2D peaks) with a spectrum of nanocrystalline graphitic carbon (with very broad D and G peaks, and similar G and D intensities).
The G to D peak intensity ratio ID:IG attributed to the nanocrystalline graphene is about 1:1, corresponding to a grain size of order 10nm.14 The main panels of Figure 4(a) show the G and 2D peaks in greater detail.
Excepting the broad background, the G peak of the impurity-decorated sample is similar in width, but slightly upshifted in position, compared to those of the Cu-grown sample (and typical exfo- liated graphene samples).
The impurity-decorated sample also shows a somewhat broader, upshifted, but still Lorentzian 2D peak.
Figure 4(b) shows Raman spectra of the impurity- decorated Pt-grown graphene taken along a line crossing an impurity island as shown in the inset.
Raman spectra both on the island and off show the broad background in the D and G peak regions, indicating nanocrystalline graphitic carbon.
The 2D peak remains Lorentzian everywhere, showing no evidence of Bernal-stacked graphite.
An upshift of the 2D peak is associated with the island region, while the G peak is hardly changed in width or position.
The consistency of the G peak excludes doping as the cause of the changes observed in the 2D peak.15 Instead, the blueshift of 2D peak is FIG.

(a) Raman spectra of a Pt-grown graphene sample with impurities similar to Figures 1 and 2 is shown in red, and for comparison Raman spectra from a Cu-grown graphene sample without impurity regions is shown in blue.
Inset shows full spectra, while main panel shows the G and 2D peak regions, with peak positions in wavenumbers (cm1).
Lorentzian ﬁts to the 2D peaks are shown in green.

The position or blueshift of the 2D peak (blue) and G peak (green) is extracted from Raman spectral.
The length of the blue and green arrows is 15.32 cm1.
Note that the maximum blue- shift happens inside the edge of the island due to lm resolution of Raman microscopy.

We also investigated the inﬂuence of growing conditions on the presence of the nanocrystalline graphitic impurities.
In addition to sample 1 discussed above, we synthesized addi- tional samples (sample 10, sample 2, sample 20, and sample 3) by changing the temperature and ﬂow rate of hydrogen but keeping the ﬂow rate of methane unchanged (see Methods).
The optical images of samples 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Figure 5(a).
Micron-sized impurity islands are seen on sample 1, as discussed above.
Sample 2 shows smaller regions of increased optical contrast, while the optical contrast of sample 3 is nearly uniform.
(The optical images for sample 10 and 20 are similar to that of sample 1 and 2, respectively.) The Raman spectra in Figure 5(b) show a high degree of similarity for samples 1 and 10, and 2 and 20, grown at the same tempera- ture but different hydrogen ﬂow rates, indicating that growth temperature is the controlling factor determining the impurity structure of the samples.
Proceeding from higher to lower growth temperature, we ﬁnd a dramatic reduction in the D peak and a red-shift of the 2D peak, consistent with a reduc- tion of the density of nanocrystalline impurities16,17 as growth temperature is reduced.
For samples 2, 20 (grown at 950 C), and 3 (grown at 900 C), the 2D to G peak ratio I2D:IG is very close to two, in good agreement with that of clean exfoliated single-layer graphene,6 though the 2D peaks for all three sam- ples have the single-Lorentzian lineshapes consistent with single-layer graphene.

Notably, the ﬁeld effect mobility of sample 1 (8300 cm2 V1 s1) is comparable to other graphene samples obtained by CVD2,18 showing much lower D peaks in Raman spectra.
Again this is indicative that the D peak in our samples arises from defects in the carbon impurity layer, not in the continuous monolayer.
We also explored the conductivity of a Hall bar region, from which the impurity islands were excluded by etching and found only a slight mobility change (Figure 5(c), dashed red curve) indicating that the impurity island regions are not entirely responsible for the decreased mobility compared to exfoliated graphene on SiO2.19,20 DISCUSSION We have thoroughly characterized graphene grown by ambient-pressure CVD on Pt foils.
We ﬁnd that some sam- ples exhibit nano-crystalline graphitic carbon impurities in addition to a continuous single crystal monolayer graphene.
The impurities are distributed inhomogeneously, especially concentrated in few-micron-sized island domains, but pres- ent everywhere on the sample.
The observation of these novel impurity structures in Pt-grown graphene is in con- trast to graphene grown by CVD on other metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, and Fe), where crystalline multi-layer graphene is formed.
It is important to understand whether the impurity car- bon is deposited on top of the monolayer graphene or forms underneath.
Our EBSD results show a strong correlation between the anisotropy of the impurity islands and the crys- talline orientation of the Pt substrate (Figure 2), but not the crystalline orientation of the graphene, which is continuous across many Pt grains.
The correlation strongly suggests that the impurity islands form beneath the monolayer gra- phene at the Pt surface; given that the islands are not highly crystalline themselves the anisotropy probably results from anisotropic diffusion of carbon along the Pt.
The detailed mechanism of the carbon cluster formation as an open question calls for further experimental and theoretical investigation,20–22 however, our results strongly support the growth-from-below model for graphene on Pt.9 Our investigation also points out difﬁculties and potential pitfalls in the standard characterization of multi- layered graphene by optical absorption and Raman spec- troscopy.
We ﬁnd that amorphous carbon impurity islands can be easily mistaken for multi-layer regions in optical images.
Characterization by TEM is thus important for reports of new synthesis methods for graphene, since it gives the most accurate crystalline information.
The Raman spectra of our sample shows a very large and broad D feature normally associated with highly defected car- bon.13 Here, we have associated the enhancement of D peak with carbon impurities; the high electronic quality of our sample excludes the possibility that the defects respon- sible for the D band are in the continuous monolayer gra- phene.
The effect of carbon impurities on the electronic transport or magneto-transport23 is a topic for further investigation.
METHODS The graphene samples studied here were grown on a 0.2 mm thick platinum foil under ﬂowing ambient pressure gas mixture of hydrogen and 5 sccm methane.1 The growth conditions for samples 1, 10, 2, 20, and 3 are shown in Table I.
The graphene samples are transferred from Pt to SiO2/Si following the electrolysis method given in Ref. 1.
To fabricate devices for electronic measurements, electron-beam lithogra- phy with poly(methyl methacrylate) resist is used to deﬁne Cr/ Au electrical leads via thermal evaporation followed by liftoff.
A second lithography step followed by etching in oxygen plasma is used to deﬁne a Hall-bar conﬁguration of the gra- phene as shown in the inset of Figure 5(c).
