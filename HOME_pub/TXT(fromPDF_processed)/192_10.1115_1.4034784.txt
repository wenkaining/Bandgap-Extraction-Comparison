The HOM model was derived directly from a three-dimensional discrete particle model, and it was shown to be associated with a high-order continuum characterized by independent rotation and displacement ﬁelds.
Furthermore, the HOM model possesses two character- istic lengths: the ﬁrst associated with the spacing of ﬂaws in the material internal struc- ture and related to the gradient character of the continuum; the second associated with the size of these ﬂaws and related to the micropolar character of the continuum.
The displacement-based ﬁnite element implementation of this type of continua requires C1 continuity both within the elements and at the element boundaries.
This motivated the implementation of the concept of isogeometric analysis which ensures a higher degree of smoothness and continuity.
Nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS) based isogeometric elements are implemented in a 3D setting, with both displacement and rotational degrees-of-freedom at each control point.
The performed numerical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HOM model implementation to ensure optimal conver- gence in both elastic and softening regime.
Furthermore, the proposed approach allows the natural formulation of a localization limiter able to prevent strain localization and spurious mesh sensitivity known to be pathological issues for typical local strain- softening constitutive equations.
[DOI: 10.1115/1.4034784] 1 Introduction The nonlinear and fracturing behavior of quasi-brittle, heteroge- neous materials such as ﬁber reinforced composites, toughened ceramics, and cementitious composites, among many others, is governed by weak spots and defects of their internal structures which cause initiation of cracks and localization of damage.
In order to model such behavior, one can use discrete particle models or continuum models.
Each type of model has its own advantages and disadvantages.
In discrete particle models, the internal structure of materials is directly simulated through its geometric approximation and accounts for the actual intrinsic randomness speciﬁc of the selected length scale.
Particles replicate the effect of major heterogeneities, and their interaction is formulated by contact algorithms or through interpar- ticle lattice struts whose constitutive behavior simulates speciﬁc physical mechanisms.
As such, discrete models have the advantage that many microscopic effects can be accounted for in a straightfor- ward manner.
However, they often lead to large computational sys- tems, especially to simulate real structures, and require a signiﬁcant, often overwhelming, amount of computational resources.
Continuum models are computationally less expensive.
But most of the continuum models are based on the Cauchy contin- uum which cannot take into account features of the internal struc- ture and does not possess any internal characteristic length.
These type of models have some well-known drawbacks.
First of all, they are not able to produce a mathematically well-posed problem in the softening regime causing strong mesh sensitivity in the numerical results [1,2].
Second, the dispersive nature of wave propagation, typical of many heterogeneous materials, cannot be reproduced.
Furthermore, conventional continuum formulations predict unrealistic stress singularities at the tip of sharp cracks and fail to simulate size effect phenomena correctly [3,4].
In order to overcome these drawbacks, nonlocal continuum the- ories have been proposed in the literature.
A popular approach consists in enriching continua with high-order strain and stresses.
Cosserat brothers’ study [5] was one of the initial attempt in this direction.
They considered independent rotational degrees of freedom, modeling smaller scale kinematics, in addition to trans- lational degrees of freedom.
Later, the couple-stress theory was developed by Toupin [6].
In this theory, the only independent ﬁeld is the displacement ﬁeld that also determines the rotations.
Erin- gen developed the so-called micropolar continuum theory [7] and nonlocal elasticity [8].
Another type of high-order theory incorpo- rate higher-order gradients of displacements, mostly second gradi- ent (strain gradient) and sometimes higher, into the constitutive model [6].
Mindlin [9–11] proposed an enhanced elastic theory with microstructural effects by considering the potential energy density as a quadratic form of gradient of strain in addition to quadratic form of strains.
Aifantis and coworkers [12–16] intro- duced a simpliﬁed gradient elasticity theory with one internal length scale which incorporates Laplacian of strain to enrich the continuum.
They applied it for investigation of crack tips, localiza- tion of shear bands, and to simulate size effect in torsion and bend- ing.
Various forms of gradient elasticity and their performance in static and dynamic applications are discussed by Askes and Aifantis [17].
They also provided a procedure for the identiﬁcation of the relevant characteristic lengths.
In this work, the ﬁnite-element implementation of gradient elasticity was also discussed.
Chang et al. [4] developed a high-order gradient model based on a discrete particle structure, which included both high-order 1Corresponding author.

They investigated the possibility of formulat- ing high-order constitutive equations with and without high-order stresses.
They found that, contrarily to the model with high-order stresses, the one without is unstable.
Misra and Yang [18] devel- oped a model for cohesive materials based on microstructural con- cepts.
They considered a representative volume of material as a collection of grains interacting through intergranular force dis- placement relations.
Intergranular force displacement relations are formulated based on atomistic-level particle interactions.
These force–displacement relationships are then used to derive the incre- mental stress–strain relationship of a representative volume of material.
Later, Yang et al. [19] applied this type of microstruc- tural granular based higher-order continuum theory to model the failure behavior of nanophased ceramics.
They compared results obtained from the ab initio simulations with the result of higher- order continuum theory with good agreement.
Nonlinear nonlocal constitutive equations were also proposed without enrichment of the elastic part and by using integral or gra- dient approaches to enrich plasticity and damage theories.
Integral type models are based on replacing a local variable with its weighted spatial averaging over a certain volume of material.
Pijaudier-Cabot and Bazant [20] pioneered research in this area.
On the contrary, gradient plasticity or gradient damage models are based on enriching state variables with high-order terms.
A phe- nomenological strain gradient plasticity theory was developed by Fleck and Hutchinson [21] in the context of couple-stress theory where only rotational part of strain gradients is taken into account.
They extended the classical J2 plasticity to account for strain gra- dient effects.
Later, they reformulated their model and included also stretch gradients in addition to rotational ones [22].
They investigated their model performance by applying it to the simula- tion of size effect on torsion of wires, sheet bending, indentation, and void growth.
The so-called mechanism-based theory of strain gradient plasticity (MSG) [23,24] was proposed on the basis of a multiscale framework linking statistically stored and geometri- cally necessary dislocations to plastic strains and strain gradient.
A reformulation of mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity was given by Ref.
[25] that involves the third-order tensor of higher-order stress to a much simpler version within Fleck and Hutchinson’s theoretical framework of strain gradient plasticity theory.
Huang et al. [26] provided a conventional theory of mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity where the plastic strain gradient appears only in the constitutive model, and the equilib- rium equations and boundary conditions are the same as the con- ventional continuum models.
Jiang et al. [27] studied on fracture employing mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity.
Finite-element implementation of material models that includes second gradient of displacements as degrees-of- freedom, require C1 continuity at the interelement boundaries or mixed-element formulation in which both kinematic and static variables are deﬁned as degrees-of-freedom.
Papanicolo- pulos et al. [28] and Zervos et al. [29] developed C1 type ﬁnite element for gradient elasticity.
Fischear et al. [30] imple- mented isogeometric analysis for gradient elasticity in two dimensions.
On the contrary, in mixed formulations, C0 conti- nuity element can be used but in this case ﬁrst derivatives should be interpolated in addition to displacements which leads to formulations with a large number of degrees-of-freedom.
These types of elements can be nonconforming and are required to fulﬁll the patch test [31–33].
Furthermore, Ru and Aifantis [34] developed a strategy based on operator split method for their simpliﬁed strain gradient model, in which the fourth-order partial differential equations of gradient elasticity are split into two separate second-order partial differential equations, and they implement it using C0 ﬁnite element.
2 Higher-Order Microplane Model Classical microplane model formulations, pioneered by Bazant and Oh [35,36], assumed that nonlinear phenomena such as, but not limited to, fracture, shearing, and plastic deformations occur on speciﬁc orientations within the internal structure of the mate- rial.
Therefore, microplane models simulate these phenomena through vectorial constitutive laws formulated on the so-called “microplanes” representing generic orientations in space.
The strain vector on a generic microplane is obtained by projecting the strain tensor onto a local system of reference, and the stress tensor is computed from tractions on all possible orientations in space through an energetic equivalence.
The initial formulations of microplane models focused on con- crete materials and the most recent one, labeled as M7 [37], has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reproduce typical experi- mental data relevant to a large variety of loading conditions, from tension to conﬁned compression; from quasi-static to highly dynamic conditions.
Microplane models have also been success- fully developed for other materials such as rock [38]; rigid foam and shape memory alloys [39,40]; ﬁber reinforced concrete [41]; as well as composite laminates [41–43].
The aforementioned microplane formulations are “local” in the sense that the stress tensor at a given point is the only function of the strain tensor at the same point.
Unfortunately, such constitutive equations suffer from mesh sensitivity and spurious energy dissipation [44] when softening behavior is simulated.
To overcome this problem, nonlocal microplane mod- els were proposed by various authors [45–47] by exploiting inte- gral methods, in which the nonlinear behavior at one point depends on a weighted average of the strain in the neighbor- hood of that point.
These approaches while preventing mesh sensitivity quite effectively lead to a signiﬁcant increase of the computational cost of simulations.
An alternative to integral microplane models is to adopt strain- gradient formulations such as the ones proposed by Kuhl et al. [48,49] and, more recently, by Cusatis and Zhou [50].
In the latter, starting from a discrete particle model, they derived a high-order microplane (HOM) theory which includes Cosserat theory and strain gradients elasticity as a special cases.
The HOM model pos- sess two characteristic lengths: the ﬁrst associated with the spac- ing of ﬂaws in the material internal structure and related to the gradient character of the continuum; and the second associated with the size of these ﬂaws and related to the micropolar character of the continuum.
Following Cusatis and Zhou [50], one can calculate microplane strains and curvatures as eb ¼ Pb ijcij þ r0Pb ijkCijk; vb ¼ Pb ijjij; b ¼ N; M; L (1) where cij ¼ uj;i  eijkuk is the strain tensor, eijk is the Levi-Civita permutation symbol jij ¼ uj;i is the curvature tensor; Cijk ¼ cij;k is the strain gradient tensor also referred to as high order strain tensor; ui, ui are displacement and rotation, respectively, at a generic position xi (i ¼ 1, 2, 3) in a 3D continuum.
The second order tensor Pb ij ¼ eN i eb j and the third order tensor Pb ijk ¼ eN i eb j eN k denote projection operators for strain and strain gradient, respec- tively, in which eb i ðb ¼ N; M; LÞ are unit vectors deﬁning a local system of reference on each microplane (see Fig 1).
The charac- teristic length r0, assumed to be a material property, can be inter- preted to be the average half spacing of weak spots in the material internal structure [50].
By using appropriate vectorial constitutive equations, the microplane stresses and microplane couple stresses can be calculated from the microplane strains and microplane curvatures: formally, one can write rb ¼ F bðeN; …; vN; …Þ and lb ¼ GbðeN; …; vN; …Þ, which can be used to obtain stress, couple stress, and high order stress tensors as rij ¼ 3 4p ð C1 rbPb ijdS; lij ¼ 3 4p ð C1 lbPb ijdS; Rijk ¼ 3r0 4p ð C1 rbPb ijkdS (2) 011005-2 / Vol. 84, JANUARY 2017 Transactions of the ASME Downloaded From: http://appliedmechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jamcav/935801/ on 02/16/2017 Terms of Use: http://www.asme.orgwhere the integrals are calculated over the surface of a unit sphere, C1; b ¼ N; M; L ; and summation rule applies over b.
Furthermore, stress, couple stress, and high order stress tensors must satisfy the conservation of linear and angular momenta which reads pji;j þ bi ¼ 0; lji;j þ eijkpjk ¼ 0 (3) where pij ¼ rij  Rijk;k is the so-called effective stress tensor; bi denote body forces.

With reference to Fig. 2, one can write, on the volume boundary, pjinj  DjðRijknkÞ þ ðDlnlÞhi ¼ ti or ui ¼ ui; Rijknjnk ¼ hi or Dui ¼ Dui; ðlji  epkiRpkjÞnj ¼ mi or ui ¼ ui, and ½½rinkRpkj ¼ ci, where ni is the unit vector orthogonal to the boundary, Di  ðdij  ninjÞ@=@xj is the surface gradient differen- tial operator, dij ¼ Kronecker delta, ti ¼ applied tractions, ui ¼ applied displacements, hi ¼ applied moment energetically conjugate to Dui; Dui ¼ ui;jnj is the displacement normal deriva- tive, Dui ¼ applied displacement normal derivative, mi ¼ applied moments energetically conjugate to rotations, ui ¼ applied rota- tions, ci ¼ applied edge traction acting along a sharp edge, ½½ is the jump operator deﬁned on a sharp edge, rj ¼ epqjspnq, and si is the unit vector tangent to a sharp edge (See Fig. 2).

3 Isogeometric Finite-Element Implementation 3.1 Isogeometric Description of Geometry.
Isogeometric analysis (IGA), introduced by Hughes et al. [51], combines computer-aided design (CAD) and ﬁnite-element method (FEM) technologies.
In IGA, the basis functions used in CAD to describe exactly the geometry of a certain volume of material are also used to discretize ﬁeld variables describing, for example, its deforma- tion and mechanical behavior.
CAD technologies commonly employ non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions which are built from B-splines [52].
B-splines are piecewise poly- nomials composed of a linear combination of basis functions deﬁned recursively as Np i n ð Þ ¼ n  ni niþp  ni Np1 i n ð Þ þ niþpþ1  n niþpþ1  niþ1 Np1 iþ1 n ð Þ (5) where i ¼ 1,…, n; n and p are the number and maximum order, respectively, of the basis functions.
The knots vector, X ¼ fn1; n2; …; nnþpþ1g is a set of nondecreasing real numbers called knots and representing coordinates in the parameter domain.
If all knots are equally spaced, the knot vector is called uniform, other- wise they are nonuniform.
For p ¼ 0, N0 i ðnÞ ¼ 1 if n is contained in the interval [ni, niþ1], and N0 i ðnÞ ¼ 0 otherwise.
For p ¼ 1, B-spline basis functions are identical to basis function of classical constant-strain ﬁnite-element formulations.
B-spline basis func- tions are linearly independent, have partition of unity property and their support is compact.
However, they, in general, do not satisfy the Kronecker delta property unless coincident knots exists in X. A B-spline is said to be open if its ﬁrst and last knots appear p þ 1 times.
Open knot vectors are interpolatory at the end knots which means they satisﬁes the Kronecker delta property at those knots [53].
B-splines cannot represent some common geometrical shapes, such as circular and ellipsoidal sections, exactly.
This can be achieved by using non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), which can be deﬁned in terms of B-spline basis functions as follows: Rp i n ð Þ ¼ Np i n ð Þ P n j¼1 Np j n ð Þwj (6) where wj are weighting factors that are selected depending upon the type of curve to be represented exactly [51,53].
A NURBS curve can in general be deﬁned as linear combina- tions of the functions deﬁned in Eq. (6).
Hence, in 3D, the generic position vector x¼[x1 x2 x3]T can be expressed as xðn; g; fÞ ¼ X n i¼1 X m j¼1 X l k¼1 Rpqr ijk ðn; g; fÞxijk ¼ X Ncp I¼1 Rpqr I ðn; g; fÞxI (7) where Rpqr I n; g; f ð Þ ¼ Rpqr ijk n; g; f ð Þ ¼ Np i n ð ÞMq j g ð ÞPr k f ð Þwijk P n ^i¼1 P m ^j¼1 P l ^k¼1 Np ^i n ð ÞMq ^j g ð ÞPr ^k f ð Þw^i^j ^k (8) Np i ; Mq j ; Pr k are the basis function deﬁned according to Eq.

3.2 Implementation of Isogeometric Element.
In this study, a isogeometric ﬁnite element is implemented in 3D with interpola- tion of displacement and rotational ﬁelds assumed to be independ- ent.
This element features six degrees of freedom (three displacement and three rotations) at each control point.
Following the isoparametric concept, the displacement ﬁeld u and rotation ﬁeld / are formulated using the same NURBS basis functions of the geometry and, for a given element, they can be approximated in terms of element’s control point displacements and rotations as follows: u ¼ X Ncp I¼1 RIue I U ¼ X Ncp I¼1 RIue I (9) where Ncp is the number of control points that are supported by one element and ue ¼ ½uxi; uyi; uzi denotes the nodal displacement vector and ue ¼ ½uxi; uyi; uzi the nodal rotation vector.
It is worth nothing that in this study the adopted shape functions in Eq. (9) are quadratic which can be obtained from Eq. (8) with p ¼ q ¼ r ¼ 2 and Ncp ¼ 27 control points per element.
In Eq. (9) and throughout the rest of the paper, the shape function super- scripts are dropped for clarity of notation.
Low- and high-order strain ﬁelds are obtained computing the spatial derivatives of the displacement ﬁeld e ¼ Lde ¼ LRde ¼ Bde (10) where e ¼ ½cij; jij; CijkT is the strain vector collecting all the strains, curvature, and high-order strain components (45 in total), d is the displacement vector, d ¼ ½ui; /i collecting all degrees of freedom of the element (6  Ncp in total), L is a differential opera- tor, R is the shape function matrix, and B is the strain–displacement matrix obtained by applying the differential operator L to the shape functions.
The B matrix can be subdivided into submatrices for low-order and high-order terms and the sepa- rate contribution of different nodes B ¼ ½ B1 B2 … BNcp ; BI ¼ ½ BIc BIj BIC T (11) in which BIc ¼ RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 1 0 0 RI;y 1 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 1 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 1 0 RI;z 0 1 0 0 0 0 RI;x 0 1 0 2 666666666666666664 3 777777777777777775 ; BIj ¼ 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;x 2 666666666666666664 3 777777777777777775 (12) BIC ¼ RI;xx 0 0 0 0 RI;zx RI;yx 0 0 RI;xy 0 0 0 0 RI;zy RI;yy 0 0 RI;xz 0 0 0 0 RI;zz RI;yz 0 0 0 RI;yx 0 RI;xx 0 0 0 RI;zx 0 0 RI;yy 0 RI;xy 0 0 0 RI;zy 0 0 RI;yz 0 RI;xz 0 0 0 RI;zz 0 0 0 RI;zx 0 RI;yx 0 0 0 RI;xx 0 0 RI;zy 0 RI;yy 0 0 0 RI;xy 0 0 RI;zz 0 RI;yz 0 0 0 RI;xz 0 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 RI;z 0 0 0 RI;x 0 0 RI;x 0 0 0 0 0 RI;y 0 0 RI;y 0 0 0 0 0 RI;z 0 0 RI;z 0 0 2 6666664 3 7777775 T (13) Once the strain displacement matrix, B, is obtained, the element stiffness matrix and the internal force vector can be calculated easily by employing appropriate quadrature rules K ¼ K11 K12    K21 K22  .. .

Even though there are recent studies attempting to derive optimal quadrature rules for IGA [54–56], in this study, Gauss quadrature is used and number of Gauss points in each direction is assumed to be 1 plus the order of basis function in each direction, that is three for quad- ratic element which leads to 27 Gauss points per element.
Gauss quadrature was originally developed for polynomial function, but it has been employed successfully for IGA element as well [51,53].
It is important to point out that the proposed element formula- tion implicitly assumes that the high order surface moments h conjugate to the normal gradient of the displacement ﬁeld (see Sec. 2 and Fig. 2) are zero.
This is due to the fact that only dis- placement and rotation degrees-of-freedom are introduced and no kinematic boundary conditions can be imposed on the normal gra- dient of displacements.
4 Numerical Results The performance of the proposed isogeometric implementation of the high-order microplane model is demonstrated in this section with reference to classical examples for gradient elasticity, Cos- serat elasticity, and strain softening.
4.1 Strain Gradient Elasticity Solution of Cantilever Beam Problems.
The exact analytical solution [57] for a cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated load at the free end is used here 011005-4 / Vol. 84, JANUARY 2017 Transactions of the ASME Downloaded From: http://appliedmechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jamcav/935801/ on 02/16/2017 Terms of Use: http://www.asme.orgas a reference for comparison with the strain gradient version of the high-order microplane model.
To obtain the macroscopic con- stitutive equations used to derive the exact solution, the micro- plane constitutive equation for gradient elasticity are formulated as follows: rN ¼ EVeV þ EDeD þ EC NeC N; rM ¼ ETec M þ EC TeC M; rL ¼ ETec L þ EC TeC L (15) and lN ¼ lM ¼ lL ¼ 0, where eb ¼ ec b þ eC b; ec b ¼ Pb ij cij; eC b ¼ r0Pb ijkCijk ðb ¼ N; M; LÞ; eV ¼ Vijcij; Vij ¼ dij=3, dij is the Kronecker delta, ec D ¼ ec N  eV, and EV, ED, ET are the volu- metric, deviatoric, and shear elastic moduli, respectively.
As already shown by Cusatis and Zhou [50], Eq. (15) lead to classical elastic constitutive equations if r0 ¼ 0; EV ¼ E=ð1  2Þ and ED ¼ ET ¼ E=ð1 þ Þ where E ¼ Young’s modulus and  ¼ Poisson’s ratio.
With the formulation in Eq. (15), the micro- plane integration (see Eq. (2)) can be done analytically and explicit form of stress, couple stress, and high-order stress tensor can be obtained as follows: rij ¼ EVeVVij þ ½EDAijkl þ ETðBijkl þ CijklÞckl; lij ¼ 0 Rijk ¼ r2 0½EVDijklmp þ ETðEijklmp þ FijklmpÞClmp (16) where Aijkl ¼3 Ð C1PD ij PD klds=4p; Bijkl ¼3 Ð C1PM ij PM klds=4p; Cijkl ¼ 3 Ð C1PL ijPL klds=4p; PD ij ¼PN ij Vij; Dijklmp ¼3 Ð C1PN ijkPN lmpds=4p; Eijklmp ¼3 Ð C1PM ijkPM lmpds=4p and Fijklmp ¼3 Ð C1PL ijkPL lmpds=4p.
By assuming ED ¼ ET ¼ E0=ð1 þ Þ; EV ¼ E0=ð1  2Þ; EC T ¼ 0 and EC N ¼ E then the gradient elasticity formulation in Beskou et al. [57] is obtained for the components r11 and R111.
It must be observed, however, that this microplane formulation leads to other nonzero high-order stress components which are absent in the analytical solution.
A cantilever beam, 1000 mm long with 100  25 mm cross sec- tion, is modeled with quadratic isogeometric solid elements.
The beam is discretized with four different meshes with 10  1  1, 20  2  1, 40  4  1 and 80  8  2 elements, respectively.
Essential boundary conditions are applied at both ends of the beam.
E ¼ 25000 MPa,  ¼ 0.2, and 2r0 ¼ 0.2L are assumed in the calculations.
In Fig. 3(a), the relative displacement (normalized with displacement value obtained from the Cauchy solution) as a function of position along the beam is given for different meshes and compared with analytical result given by Beskou et al. [57].
It can be seen from the ﬁgure that with mesh reﬁnement the tip dis- placement converges to a certain value.
The overall calculated elastic curve is in general good agreement with the analytical solution, to which, however, it does not converge exactly.
The main reason for this discrepancy is that in the analytical solution, they only consider one high-order term Cxxx ¼ cxx,x, but the pro- posed HOM model is a 3D model and it features automatically other high order terms.
Figure 3(b) reports the obtained response for different values of the internal length scale, r0.
As expected, with the increase of the internal length scale, the beam response becomes stiffer.
Also, for the internal length that tends to zero, the response converges to the classical Bernoulli beam solution.
The second beam example is relevant to an experimental study carried out by Lam et al. [58] on epoxy beams.
Tests were carried out in plane strain conditions on end-point loaded cantilever beams with 20, 38, 75, and 115 lm depth and length-to-depth ratio equal to 10.
The elastic properties of the epoxy are reported as E ¼ 1.44 GPa and  ¼ 0.38 [58].
The microplane simulations were performed with EC T ¼ ET and EC N ¼ EV, and the material charac- teristic length was optimized according to the experimental result for the 20 lm beam.
The best ﬁt is obtained with 2r0 ¼ 33.2 lm.
Based on these material parameters, the other beams are simu- lated.
Three-dimensional quadratic isogeometric elements are used, and the beams are discretized with 40  4  1 elements.
In order to provide plane strain condition, the lateral displacement (uz) of nodes on external surfaces (x-y plane) are restricted.
Figure 3(c) illustrates the change of normalized bending stiffness, D ¼ PL3=ð3wbh3Þ, predicted by the proposed model and obtained in the experiments.
In the deﬁnition of D, P is the applied load; w is the corresponding displacement; b, h, and L are beam thickness, depth, and length, respectively.
The model can reproduce very well the beam behavior exhibiting size effect: the smaller the thickness the larger the normalized bending stiffness [58].
This behavior cannot be produced by classical beam, which always gives constant value for the bending stiffness.

The presented high-order microplane theory reduced to a Cosserat continuum when the material characteristic length, r0, is equal to zero, and the microplane constitutive equations are formulated as follows: rN ¼ EVeV þ EDeD; rM ¼ ETeM; rL ¼ ETeL (17) lN ¼ WVvV þ WDvD; lM ¼ WTvM; vL ¼ WTvL (18) where eV is the volumetric strain, eD ¼ eN  eV; vV ¼ Vijvij; vD ¼ vN  vV. Also in this case, the microplane integra- tion (Eq. (2)) can be done analytically and explicit form of stress and couple stress tensors are obtained as follows: Fig. 3 Numerical results for the cantilever beam problems: (a) elastic curves for various meshes and comparison with beam theory solution, (b) calculated response for different internal length values, and (c) change of normalized bending stiffness with respect to thickness Journal of Applied Mechanics JANUARY 2017, Vol. 84 / 011005-5 Downloaded From: http://appliedmechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jamcav/935801/ on 02/16/2017 Terms of Use: http://www.asme.orgrij ¼ EVeVVij þ ½EDAijkl þ ETðBijkl þ CijklÞckl lij ¼ WVvVVij þ ½WDAijkl þ WTðBijkl þ CijklÞjkl (19) where the tensors Vij, Aijkl, Bijkl, and Cijkl are the same ones intro- duced in Sec. 4.1.
Cusatis and Zhou [50] derived the relationship between the microplane parameters and the ones of Cosserat elas- ticity as EV ¼ 3k þ 2l þ v; ED ¼ 5l þ v; ET ¼ v and WV ¼ 3p1 þ p2 þ p3; WD ¼ p2 þ 4p3; WT ¼ p2  p3.
In order to demonstrate the efﬁciency of the isogeometric ele- ment for the integration of the Cosserat theory, this section dis- cusses a well-known stress concentration problem consisting of an inﬁnite plate with a circular hole subjected to a uniaxial far ﬁeld tension.
The Cosserat continuum has a characteristic length which arises from the unit mismatch between stresses and couple stresses.
This affects the stress concentration factor around the hole.
Analytical solutions of this problem for classical Cosserat continuum were given by Eringen [59] and for Couple Stress theory by Mindlin [60] in 2D case.
In both references, the stress concentration factor is deﬁned as SCF ¼ rxð0; rÞ=r1 x ¼ ð3 þ FÞ= ð1 þ FÞ, where F ¼ ½8l2 b=l2 cð1  Þ=½4 þ ðr=lcÞ2 þ 2ðr= lcÞK0ðr=lcÞ=K1ðr=lcÞ, r is the radius of the hole, lb ¼ ½p3=2ð2l þ vÞ1=2; lc ¼ ½ðp2 þ p3Þ=ð2l þ vÞ1=2 [61] are the mate- rial characteristic lengths, and K0 and K1 are the second kind modiﬁed Bessel functions of order zero and one, respectively.
Mindlin gives exactly the same equation for the case of l2 b=l2 c ¼ 1.
Furthermore, it is convenient to deﬁne [61] the coupling factor, Nc ¼ ½v=2ðl þ vÞ, which is a nondimensional quantity taking values between 0 and 1.
For Nc ¼ 1 the couple-stress theory is recovered, and for Nc ¼ 0, the Cauchy continuum is obtained [61].
This example was also simulated by Pothier and Rencis [61] and Sachio et al. [62].
In the ﬁnite-element simulations discussed in this section, the material parameters are taken from Ref.
[61], and they are reported in Table 1.
Four simulations with different coupling factor are performed by assuming plate dimensions of 300  300  10 mm3 and hole radius of 10 mm.
Considering the symmetry along the x- and y-axes, only one quarter of the speci- men is modeled as shown in Fig. 4.
Applied boundary conditions are also speciﬁed in Fig. 4.
A 3D ﬁnite-element model was setup with quadratic isogeometric solid element, and the IGA meshes was obtained by using IGAFEM [53].
Two different meshes are used with 1024 (32  32) and 4096 (64  64) elements.
For both meshes, only one element is used along the thickness.
The coarser mesh is shown in Fig. 4, where a zoom-in highlights the geometry of one element and the corresponding control points.
Two more layers of control points are present through the thickness (for a total of 27 control points) but they are not visible in the ﬁgure.
Table 2 presents the comparison of the obtained stress concentra- tion factors with the analytic solution.
The results show very good agreement with analytical values with error less than 3.7% and 0.9% for mesh-1 and mesh-2, respectively.
4.3 Localization Behavior of a Softening Bar in Tension.
This section presents the simulation of softening behavior with the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of the regularization strategy proposed by Cusatis and Zhou within the presented high- order isogeometric implementation [50].
The adopted softening constitutive equation follows the formula- tion proposed by Cusatis et al. [63].
The microplane couple stresses are assumed to be zero lN ¼ lM ¼ lL ¼ 0.
The microplane stresses are computed with damage-like constitutive equations as follows: rN ¼ r e eN rM ¼ a r e eM rL ¼ a r e eL (20) where a is a material parameter, r ¼ ðr2 N þ r2 T=aÞ1=2 is the effec- tive stress, rT ¼ ðr2 M þ r2 LÞ1=2 is the total shear stress, e ¼ ðe2 N þ ae2 TÞ1=2 is the effective strain, and eT ¼ ðe2 M þ e2 LÞ1=2 is the total shear strain.
In the elastic regime, the effective stress is pro- portional to the effective strain: r ¼ E0e, in which E0 is the micro- plane normal modulus.
E0 and a can be related to Young’s modulus, E, and Poisson’s ratio, , through the following expres- sions: E0 ¼ E=ð1  2Þ and a ¼ ð1  4Þ=ð1 þ Þ.
The nonlinear behavior is imposed by computing the effective stress incremen- tally, _r ¼ E0_e, and satisfying the inequality 0  r  rbtðe; xÞ where rbt ¼ r0ðxÞexp ½H0ðxÞhe  e0ðxÞi=r0ðxÞ; hxi ¼ max fx; 0g; e0ðxÞ ¼ r0ðxÞ=E0, and tanðxÞ ¼ eN= ﬃﬃﬃa p eT ¼ rN ﬃﬃﬃa p =rT. The post peak softening modulus is deﬁned as H0ðxÞ ¼ Htð2x=pÞnt, where Ht is the softening modulus in pure Table 1 Material parameters for the stress concentration simulations Case Nc E (N/m2) (–) v (N/m2) p1 (N) p2 (N) p3 (N) SIM1 0.00 1.195  108 0.300 0.0 0 7.593  108 0 SIM2 0.25 1.263  108 0.308 6.895  106 0 8.541  109 0 SIM3 0.50 1.856  107 0.346 6.895  106 0 1.708  109 0 SIM4 0.70 1.856  107 0.346 3.448  108 0 1.708  109 0 Fig. 4 Plate with a hole under tension: (a) schematic sketch of loading and boundary condi- tions, (b) typical ﬁnite-element mesh, and (c) mesh zoom-in with highlighted isogeometric ele- ment with corresponding control points Table 2 Calculated and analytical stress concentration factors Case Analytical Ref.

In the previous equations, the effective strength is formulated in such a way to have a smooth transition between pure tension (x ¼ p/2) and pure shear (x ¼ 0) with parabolic variation in the rN versus rT= ﬃﬃﬃa p plane: r0ðxÞ ¼ rtr2 stðsinðxÞ þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ sin2ðxÞ þ 4a cos2ðxÞ=r2 st q Þ= ½2a cos2ðxÞ, where rst ¼ rs/rt is the ratio of shear strength to tensile strength.
By assuming E ¼ 25 GPa,  ¼ 0.2, r0 ¼ 5 mm, rt ¼ 3 MPa, rs/rt ¼ 4 MPa, and ‘t ¼ 100 mm, a prismatic bar subject to uniax- ial tension is modeled with 3D quadratic isogeometric solid ele- ments.
The bar is 100 mm long and has 75  75 mm2 rectangular cross section.
One end of the bar is ﬁxed in all directions, and a displacement is prescribed at opposite end in the longitudinal direction.
Four different meshes are used with 10  1  1, 20  1  1, 40  1  1 and 80  1  1 elements.
The microplane stress integration is performed by a Voronoi integration scheme (see the Appendix) with 66 microplane over the entire unit sphere.
In order to control the location of the localization zone, the central one tenth of the bar is weakened by reducing the tensile strength by 10%.
For comparison, simulations with r0 ¼ 0 are also performed.
As one might expect, for r0 ¼ 0 the bar response is mesh dependent.
The load–displacement curve is increasingly more brittle (Fig. 5(a)) as the mesh becomes more reﬁned and damage local- izes always in one single element (see in Fig. 5(e)), where the lon- gitudinal strain proﬁle is plotted for a bar end displacement of 0.2 mm.
Figures 5(b) and 5(f) show that the mesh sensitivity is only partially mitigated for r0 6¼ 0.
In this case, the bar response is increasingly brittle upon mesh reﬁnement immediately after the peak.
The solution is less dependent on the mesh in the softening branch.
The strain proﬁle (Fig. 5(f)) does not show the extreme strain localization of the local simulation but still there is not a clear convergence upon mesh reﬁnement.
Cusatis and Zhou [50] conducted a 1D spectral analysis of localization and proposed to regularize the solution by computing the high-order stresses as Rijk ¼ 3r0 4p ð C1 rb þ S0wb  Pb ijkdS (21) where wb ¼ r0Pb ijkCijk, and S0 is the localization limiter.
For the 1D case and for linear softening, one can obtain a localization band equal to 2r0, if S0¼(1 þ 1/p2)Ht [50].
For exponential soften- ing, in which the softening modulus is not constant, the localiza- tion limiter must be a function of the current value of strain.
In this case, and again with reference to a 1D setting, one can write S0 ¼ ð1 þ 1=p2ÞHt expðHthe  etiÞ with et ¼ rt/E0.
In order to use this 1D result in the microplane formulation one can write S0ðe; xÞ ¼ ð1 þ 1=p2ÞH0ðxÞexpðH0ðxÞhe  e0ðxÞiÞ (22) where x accounts for the presence of shear on the microplanes (see the adopted constitutive equations above).
From the physical point of view, this regularization strategy corresponds to adding, in parallel with the softening microplane stresses, additional nonsoftening microplane stresses which ensure that the phase velocity of a propagating uniaxial wave is always real.
It is worth noting that such parallel coupling of softening and elastic components is also intrinsically captured by the microplane model by virtue of the kinematic constraint (Eq. 1) and the micro–macro stress relation (Eq. 2).
This is the reason why partial regularization is attained with r06¼ 0 and S0¼ 0 (Figs. 5(b) and 5(f)).
Figures 5(c) and 5(g) show the obtained response by adopting the formulation in Eqs. (21) and (22).
As one can see, the initial softening branch is very well regularized.
However, the rest of the softening curve shows an oscillatory behavior, the convergence upon mesh reﬁnement is not clear, and a residual load appear even for relatively large strains (stress locking).
The strain proﬁle does Fig. 5 Load–displacement and strain proﬁle curves for a bar under uniaxial tension: (a) local formulation, (b) high-order for- mulation with no regularization, (c) high order formulation with regularization on the total high-order stresses, and (d) high- order formulation with regularization on the high-order stress increments Journal of Applied Mechanics JANUARY 2017, Vol. 84 / 011005-7 Downloaded From: http://appliedmechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jamcav/935801/ on 02/16/2017 Terms of Use: http://www.asme.orgnot localize in one element but, again, clear convergence cannot be demonstrated.
The stress locking phenomenon is due to the fact that the addi- tional elastic high order stresses are added during the entire simula- tion, since the beginning when the material has yet to soften.
This is clearly unnecessary.
An alternative regularization scheme which avoids this shortcoming can be formulated by introducing the regula- rization term on the stress increments as opposed to total stress.
In this case, Eq. (21) is substituted by the following equations: dRijk ¼ 3r0 4p ð C1 drb þ S0dwb  Pb ijkds; Rijk ¼ ð dRijk (23) where S0 ¼ 0 for e < e0(x) and Eq. (22) holds for e  e0(x).
Figures 5(d) and 5(h) shows the results obtained with this incre- mental formulation.
As one can see, both the load–displacement curve and the strain proﬁle along the bar are fully regularized and both show a clear convergence upon mesh reﬁnement.
The local- ization band is larger than the theoretical 1D value of 2r0.
This is due to the intrinsic 3D formulation of the microplane model which, even under uniaxial tensile macroscopic conditions, fea- ture tensile and shear strains and stresses at each microplane ori- entation.
The correct estimate of the localization band requires a fully 3D spectral analysis, which, however, is intractable from the analytical point of view (see discussion in Ref. [50]).
5 Conclusions This paper presents the isogeometric ﬁnite-element implemen- tation of a recently developed high-order microplane (HOM) model.
The HOM model was originally derived based on a dis- crete particle model and the resulting theory includes gradient elasticity and Cosserat theory as a special cases.
In addition, the HOM model allows for an effective regularization of softening constitutive equations by means of a simple modiﬁcation of the high-order stresses.
The numerical simulations are carried out with an isogometric ﬁnite element characterized by 27 control points and six degrees of freedom, three displacement components and three rotation components, at each control point.
The spatial integrals were performed with a gauss quadrature scheme with 27 gauss points, and the microplane integration was carried out by a novel integration scheme based on the Voronoi discretization of the unit sphere with 66 microplanes.
Based on the results presented in the paper the following con- clusions can be drawn: (1) The implemented ﬁnite element with adoption of the HOM model as constitutive equation performs very well in the numerical simulations of classical high-order elasticity problems.
This was veriﬁed by simulating bending of strain-gradient elastic cantilever beams and computing the stress concentration due to a circular hole in a Cosserat elastic plate subject to tension.
(2) The HOM formulation with softening constitutive laws is only partially regularized, and it shows mesh dependence in the softening branch close to the peak load.
(3) The regularization technique previously proposed by Cusa- tis and Zhou [50] solves the mesh dependency in the initial post peak but leads to stress locking and lack of clear con- vergence in the far post peak.
(4) An optimal regularization of the postpeak response is obtained by introducing the regularizing term on the high- order stress increments as opposed to the total high-order stresses.
With this approach a clear convergence can be observed for both the load versus displacement curve and the strain proﬁle along the bar.

Appendix: Voronoi Integration Scheme For inelastic constitutive equations, Eq. (2) can only be com- puted numerically.
In the previous microplane model works [35,36,64], gaussian optimal integration formulas were developed for the integration over the unit hemisphere.
However, for the high-order microplane model adopted in this paper, integration over the entire unit sphere is required.
Hence, a new integration scheme was developed based on the voronoi tessellation of the unit sphere [65,66].
Figure 6 show the discretization of a unit sphere with 66 microplanes.
The corresponding areas and spheri- cal angles are reported in Table 3.
The local system of reference, attached to each microplane, can be calculated as n1 ¼ sin / cos h; n2 ¼ sin / sin h; n3 ¼ cos /; m1 ¼ cos / cos h; m2 ¼ cos / sin h; m3 ¼ sin /; and l1 ¼ sin h; l2 ¼ cos h; l3 ¼ 0.
For the discretized sphere, the energetical equivalence, that relates microplane stresses, microplane couple stresses, and microplane high-order stresses to their macroscopic counterparts, can be written as X np s¼1 ðrijdcij þ lijdjij þ RijkdCijkÞVs ¼ X np s¼1 Rðrs bdes b þ ls bdvs bÞAs (24) where np is the number of microplanes, R ¼ 1, As is the area of the generic microplane, and Vs is the volume of a pyramid of unit height and base area equal to As.
Since the macroscopic quantities are uniform inside the unit sphere and by using the kinematic con- straint in Eq. (1), one obtains rij ¼ 3 X np s¼1 wsrs bPs ij; Rijk ¼ 3‘0 X np s¼1 wsrs bPs ijk (25) where ws ¼ As= Pnp s¼1 As is the area ratio of microplane s over the total area of all microplanes.
