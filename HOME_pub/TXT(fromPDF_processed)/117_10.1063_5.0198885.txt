Experimental reports of the electron mobility of this material vary widely depending on the growth conditions and doping concentrations.
In this work, we calculate the electron mobility of SnO2 from first principles to examine the temperature and doping concentration dependence and to elucidate the scattering mechanisms that limit transport.
We include both electron–phonon scattering and electron-ionized impurity scattering to accurately model scattering in a doped semiconductor.
We find a strongly anisotropic mobility that favors transport in the direction parallel to the c-axis.
At room temperature and intrinsic carrier concentra- tions, the low-energy polar-optical phonon modes dominate scattering, while ionized-impurity scattering dominates above 1018 cm3.

https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0198885 Rutile SnO2 is a transparent conductor that finds applications in devices such as photovoltaics, sensors, and transistors.1–3 The ease of n-type doping by unintentionally incorporated hydrogen or through impurities (F, Sb) enables free-electron concentrations in the 1016–1020cm3 range.4 Since the first synthesis of SnO2 single crys- tals,5 numerous experimental studies have reported a wide range of electron mobility values.6–12 In contrast, first-principles computational studies of electron transport in SnO2, which enable the determination of the theoretical upper mobility limit and the differentiation of the various electron-scattering mechanisms, have emerged only recently.
These existing studies use models and approximations, such as the Fr€ohlich and acoustic deformation potential (ADP) scattering models and the relaxation time approximation (RTA), to calculate electron mobility.13,14 While they reduce the computational cost needed to quantify electron scattering and its effect on transport, they have lim- ited accuracy.15,16 In contrast to models, maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) provide an efficient and predictive computational frame- work to interpolate the key quantities of carrier transport (electron energies, phonon frequencies, scattering matrix elements) determined from first principles to fine Brillouin-zone (BZ) sampling grids.17–19 MLWFs exploit the spatial localization of electron and phonon wave- functions in real space to interpolate these quantities to arbitrary wave-vectors.
The MLWFs are constructed using first-principles calcu- lation on a coarse BZ grid and retain first-principles accuracy when interpolating to the fine grids needed to capture electron-scattering processes.
The interpolated quantities are then used to iteratively solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and calculate mobility val- ues.20 To make a meaningful comparison to experiment, mobility cal- culations need to include the two dominant forms of scattering in heavily doped semiconductors: electron–phonon scattering and electron-ionized impurity scattering.

124, 172103 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0198885 124, 172103-1 Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing Applied Physics Letters ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/apl  17 June 2025 14:32:55(intrinsic mobility) represents the upper limit in defect-free semicon- ductors.
However, because SnO2 is often doped to high carrier concen- trations and has shallow donor energies,4 the resulting ionized dopants also constitute a significant source of scattering.
While doping increases the carrier concentration and hence the conductivity, it is important to also consider how mobility is adversely affected by the resulting increased ionized-impurity concentration.
By including the scattering rates from both electron–phonon and electron-ionized impurity interactions, the combined effect of the two scattering mecha- nisms can be captured in the solution of the BTE.16 In this work, we calculate the electron mobility in rutile SnO2 as a function of temperature and doping concentration from first princi- ples, accounting for scattering by both phonons and ionized impuri- ties.
We study the temperature dependence of the phonon-limited mobility and identify the polar-optical phonons as the dominant scat- tering modes, finding that at room temperature, the low-energy polar- optical phonons around 30 meV contribute to 82% of the scattering.
The total mobility, limited by both phonons and ionized impurities, decreases with increasing carrier concentration due to increasing scat- tering from ionized dopants.
The mobility is anisotropic and highest along the c-axis, due to lower electron effective mass and reduced scat- tering along this direction.
We also calculate the Hall mobility and find good agreement with the highest experimentally measured room- temperature mobility values of 260 cm2/Vs.9 To calculate the electron mobility of SnO2, we iteratively solve the Boltzmann transport equation using material parameters obtained from density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (G0W0 method) as summarized herein.
Specifics of calculation parameters are provided in the supplementary material.
We used Quantum ESPRESSO21,22 to carry out DFT structural- relaxation calculations within the local density approximation (LDA).
The calculated lattice parameters and other material properties of SnO2 are in good agreement with previous experimental and theoreti- cal studies (Table I).
The phonons and electron–phonon matrix ele- ments were calculated using DFPT.23 The phonon dispersion and frequencies at the C point are shown in Fig. S2 and Table SI.24,25 To improve the description of the band structure, we used the G0W0 method within BerkeleyGW26,27 to calculate quasiparticle cor- rections to energies of the electronic states.28–30 The quasiparticle cor- rections improve the severely underestimated LDA bandgap (0.749eV) to a value of 3.182 eV that is in better agreement with exper- iment (Table I).
The G0W0 bandgap is still lower than the experimen- tal value of 3.59 eV,31 but it is the curvature of the bands that affects the calculation of transport properties.
The electron effective masses evaluated from the G0W0 quasiparticle band structure, depicted in Fig. 1, are in good agreement with both experiment and previous theo- retical studies (Table I).31–36 We used the EPW code19 to calculate the electron mobility.
The quasiparticle energies, phonon frequencies, and electron–phonon cou- pling matrix elements were calculated on an 8  8  12 Brillouin-zone sampling grid and interpolated to finer grids using the maximally localized Wannier function method as implemented in Wannier90.17,37 We include both dipole and quadrupole corrections to the interpolation of the long-range components of the electron– phonon matrix elements.38–40 The quadrupole tensor (Table SII) was calculated using ABINIT41–43 with LDA pseudopotentials without nonlinear core corrections,44 while the dipole corrections are handled by EPW.19 The interpolated quantities were used to solve the linearized BTE to calculate the phonon-limited and ionized-impurity-limited16 electron drift and Hall45 mobilities as a function of temperature and carrier concentration.
The equations used for the mobility calculations are reported in Sec. S2.
We assume complete donor ionization and set the carrier concentration equal to the ionized-impurity concentration.

We also investigated the carrier-concentration dependence over the 1016–1020cm3 range at 300 K. We find that the room-temperature electron drift mobility of SnO2, considering the combined effects of both phonon and ionized- impurity scattering, for a carrier concentration of 1017cm3 is 373cm2/ Vs in the direction parallel to the c-axis and 228cm2/Vs perpendicular to the c-axis.
This anisotropy reflects the difference in effective masses, where m is heavier in the perpendicular direction.
The anisotropy in the mobilities is stronger than in the effective masses (1.64 compared to 1.46), indicating that, in addition to a directional dependence in the band curvature, there is also anisotropy in the scattering rates.
We next examine the temperature dependence of the drift mobil- ity and its decomposition in terms of scattering by phonons and ion- ized impurities (Fig. 2).
The phonon-limited mobility decreases with increasing temperature, as expected due to higher phonon occupations at elevated temperatures.
We fit the temperature dependence of the phonon-limited mobility according to46 lph T ð Þ ¼ 1 llow e Tlow=T þ 1 lhigh e Thigh=T   !
1 : (1) The first term on the right-hand side represents lower-energy phonon modes that dominate scattering at lower temperatures, while the second term represents higher-energy phonon modes that dominate at higher temperatures.
In polar semiconductors where macroscopic electric fields created by longitudinal-optical phonons can couple to electrons, polar- optical phonons are often the dominant source of phonon scattering.15 Our calculations confirm that the polar-optical modes contribute the most to limiting the mobility.
The Tlow and Thigh that we fit (Table SIII) correspond to the energies of polar-optical Eu modes with approximate frequencies of 30–40 and 80meV, respectively.
These same polar- optical modes also have the largest mode-resolved electron self-energies (Fig. S3).
The spectral decomposition of scattering rates in Fig. 2(b) show that at room temperature, the lower-energy Eu optical phonon modes with energies of 30–40meV dominate scattering, contributing to 82% of the scattering rate, as the occupations of the higher-energy Eu mode is low (4%–6%).
Because the dominant longitudinal-optical modes are well-described by dipole interactions, the inclusion of quad- rupole interactions changes the mobilities by less than 1% (Sec. S5).
We also found that the ionized-impurity-limited mobility increases with increasing temperature.
This is because carriers with higher kinetic energy are less affected by impurities at higher tempera- tures.
The temperature dependence of the ionized-impurity-limited mobility is characterized by a power-law model, lii T ð Þ ¼ l0 T 300  a ; (2) where we normalize temperature and set l0 to the ionized-impurity- limited mobility at 300 K. For SnO2, we find that a is close to 1 for both directions (Table SIII), indicating that there is a nearly linear dependence of the ionized-impurity-limited mobility on temperature.
The total drift mobility, which includes the effects of both pho- non and ionized-impurity scattering, is dominated by phonon scatter- ing, as seen by its decreasing value with increasing temperature.
We characterize the temperature dependence of the total mobility by com- bining the previous two equations according to a Matthiessen’s rule- like expression as follows:47 ltotal T ð Þ ¼ 1 llow e Tlow=T þ 1 lhigh e Thigh=T þ 1 l0 T 300  a   !
1 ; (3) where the fitted parameters are listed in Table SIII.
We find that for a moderate dopant concentration of 1017cm3, ionized-impurity scatter- ing is weak, and electron-phonon scattering dominates the mobility.
Furthermore, Matthiessen’s rule does not describe SnO2 well across the entire temperature range, which can be seen in both the difference in parameters fit for the total mobility compared to those for the individual mobilities as well as through a direct comparison of total mobilities to those computed with Matthiessen’s rule (Fig. S4).
This behavior has also been seen in other semiconductors.16 While the scattering rates are assumed to be independent and can be added together, this does not mean the inverse of the mobilities can likewise be added together because of self-consistency in the solution of the BTE and state-dependent scat- tering rates.16 Matthiessen’s rule is only a good approximation in SnO2 at high temperatures, at which phonon scattering dominates.
Next, we examine the dependence of the drift mobility on the car- rier concentration.
While higher doping concentrations introduce more free electrons, they also contribute more scattering by ionized donor impurities.
Our results [Fig. 3(a)] show that the high mobility values in the low-doping regime (dominated by phonon scattering) decrease by approximately 50% in the high-doping limit.
We fit the carrier-concentration dependence of total mobility with the empirical expression of Caughey and Thomas as follows:48 FIG.

Finally, to compare to experimental Hall measurements, we cal- culate the room-temperature electron Hall mobility of rutile SnO2 as a function of carrier concentration and find good agreement with exper- imental values.
The fitted Caughey–Thomas parameters for the Hall mobility are listed in Table SIV.
Across the examined range of carrier concentrations, the Hall mobility values are similar to the drift mobility and follow the same trend (Fig. 3).
Experimental measurements of the Hall mobility at various carrier concentrations are also shown in Fig. 3(b) for comparison.
The agreement is excellent in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis, while our calculations slightly overestimate mobility compared to experiment along the parallel direction.
We compare our results to previous theoretical investigations of carrier transport in SnO2 to explore how different models and approxi- mations affect the calculated mobility values.
A study of tin-based oxide semiconductors by Hu et al.13 used the RTA to calculate the phonon-limited drift and Hall mobility of SnO2.
Reference 13 calcu- lates the acoustic phonon-limited mobility using the ADP scattering model, the optical phonon-limited mobility using the Fr€ohlich model, and combines the two using Matthiessen’s rule to obtain the total phonon-limited mobility.
It finds the room-temperature drift mobility parallel to the c-axis to be 229 cm2/Vs and perpendicular to be 166cm2/V s.
The anisotropy in these mobility values is lower than the anisotropy in our mobility values, but do agree with the anisotropy of our effective masses.
This is likely because Ref. 13 assumes isotropic phonon scattering and only considers anisotropy in the directionally dependent effective masses.
The mobility values in Ref.
13 are lower than ours at nondegenerate concentrations (below 1019cm3), despite the fact that it does not consider scattering by ionized impurities.
This difference could be attributed to the use of the RTA, which underesti- mates mobilities compared to iterative solutions of the BTE.
The RTA sums scattering processes into a scattering rate that only accounts for scattering out of a given state, while iteration allows for scattering back into a state that increases the lifetime and consequently the mobility.50 In fact, we find that the room-temperature phonon-limited mobility calculated using the RTA is 40% lower than iterative solutions of the BTE (Fig. S5).
Reference 13 also calculates the Hall mobility to com- pare it to experiment, finding a room-temperature Hall factor of 1.38, which is higher than our Hall factors that range between 0.98 and 1.12 across the temperatures and carrier concentrations (Fig. S6).
This dis- crepancy could be due to the methodology differences for computing the Hall factor.
Reference 13 uses energy-averaged scattering times that assume parabolic bands and isotropy, while our work uses the BTE augmented with a magnetic field term, which takes into account the full details of the band structure and scattering processes.
A computational study on mobility in SnO2 that does take into account both phonon and ionized-impurity scattering was performed by Li et al.14 Similar to our work, the scattering mechanisms are com- bined by summing the individual scattering rates, which is more accu- rate than applying Matthiessen’s rule to the individual mobilities.
To calculate the scattering rates, Ref.
14 uses the ADP and Fr€ohlich mod- els for acoustic and polar-optical phonons, respectively, and the Brooks–Herring model for ionized impurities.
The mobility is calcu- lated with the RTA using the relaxation times from the summed scat- tering rates.
In contrast to this work, Ref.
14 obtains an average mobility by averaging along the different directions.
The total average mobility that Ref.
14 finds is lower than our mobilities in both direc- tions, most likely due to the fact that, similar to Ref.
13, this study does not use an iterative solution of the BTE.
Many experimental measurements of mobility have been reported for SnO2,6–8,10,11 but we compare our results to that of Fonstad and Rediker9 and Bierwagen and Galazka12 because they spec- ify the direction of mobility measured.
Since our work finds that the mobility values are strongly directionally dependent, a proper compar- ison to experiment must take this anisotropy into account.
The mobility is highest along the c direction, which implies that aligning the c-axis along the direction of the transport would result in better performance for SnO2 electronic devices.
The anisotropy we find at room temperature is stronger than that found by Bierwagen and Galazka12 through van der Pauw measurements, which can be seen by our relatively larger mobility along the c-axis.
The overestimation of mobility can be attributed to extra sources of scattering in experiment that our theory does not take into account, such as point defects and dislocations.
This implies that to optimize device performance, it would be best to focus on minimizing other sources of scattering as the intrinsic mobility of the material itself is high.
Thin-film devices in par- ticular would benefit most from a reduction in interface roughness, which accounts for the largest additional source of scattering. FIG. 3.

We find that the mobility along the c-axis is approximately 1.6 times higher than in the perpendicular direction.
The low-frequency polar-optical phonon modes contribute the most to scattering near room temperature, while high-frequency polar-optical modes dominate at higher temperatures.
We also examine the carrier-concentration dependence of the mobil- ity, including the effects of both phonon and ionized-impurity scatter- ing, and find that the trend is described well by the empirical Caughey–Thomas model observed in other semiconductors.
We also find good agreement between our calculated Hall mobility values and experimental measurement, particularly along the direction perpendic- ular to the c-axis.
Our work provides rigorous, first-principles insight into the dominant scattering mechanisms and the upper bounds to the electron mobility in rutile SnO2 and can guide the further development of SnO2-based electronic devices.
