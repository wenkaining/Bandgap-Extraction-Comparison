For instance, LiFeO2 has been spotted as an alternative cathode material in Li-ion batteries, while LiFe5O8 is the  lowest damping ferrite, holding promise in the field of spintronics.
The Li-content in lithium ferrites has been  shown to greatly affect the physical properties, and in turn, the performance of functional devices based on these  materials.
Despite this, lithium content is rarely accurately quantified, as a result of the low number of electrons  in Li hindering its identification by means of routine materials characterization methods.
In the present work,  magnetic lithium ferrite powders with Li:Fe ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5 have been synthesized, successfully  obtaining phase-pure materials (LiFeO2 and LiFe5O8), as well as a controlled mixture of both phases.
The  powders have been compacted and subsequently sintered by thermal treatment (Tmax = 1100 ◦C) to fabricate  dense pellets which preserve the original Li:Fe ratios.
Li-content on both powders and pellets has been deter­ mined by two independent methods: (i) Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy combined with nuclear reaction  analysis and (ii) Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data.
With good agreement between both tech­ niques, it has been confirmed that the Li:Fe ratios employed in the synthesis are maintained in the sintered  ceramics.
The same conclusion is drawn from spatially-resolved confocal Raman microscopy experiments on  regions of a few microns.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy has evidenced the substantial grain  growth taking place during the sintering process – mean particle sizes rise from ≈600 nm in the powders up to  3.8(6) µm for dense LiFeO2 and 10(2) µm for LiFe5O8 ceramics.
Additionally, microstructural analysis has  revealed trapped pores inside the grains of the sintered ceramics, suggesting that grain boundary mobility is  governed by surface diffusion.
Vibrating sample magnetometry on the ceramic samples has confirmed the ex­ pected soft ferrimagnetic behavior of LiFe5O8 (with Ms = 61.5(1) Am2/kg) and the paramagnetic character of  LiFeO2 at room temperature.
A density of 92.7(6)% is measured for the ceramics, ensuring the mechanical  integrity required for both their direct utilization in bulk shape and their use as targets for thin-film deposition.
1. Introduction  Lithium ferrites (i.e, LiFeO2, LiFe5O8) are materials of great interest  due to their multiple and varied properties and applications.
More  specifically, the rock-salt lithium ferrite, LiFeO2, is an antiferromagnetic  (AFM) material below ≈90 K and paramagnetic at room temperature  (RT) [1,2].
LiFeO2 has drawn great attention as an alternative to LiCoO2,  the most widely used cathode material in commercial Li-ion batteries.
With a very similar atomic structure, LiFeO2 has been proposed as a  candidate for substituting the Co-based ferrite owing to the greater  abundance, lower price and non-toxicity of Fe compared to that of Co. [1,3–5].
LiFeO2 is also a good chemical sorbent for CO2, which is used as  a strategy to reduce the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere [6,7],  and it has also been proposed as electrocatalyst material for a sustain­ able NH3 production through reduction of N2 [8].
Additionally, the  unusual optical transitions recently reported for LiFeO2 open the door  * Corresponding author.

The spinel lithium ferrite, LiFe5O8, is a soft ferrimagnetic (FiM)  material with great technological significance.
Spinel ferrites in general  are widely used in microwave devices (e.g. isolators, circulators, phase  shifters, absorbers) [10,11].
Compared to other soft spinel ferrites,  LiFe5O8 stands out with the highest Curie temperature (TC ≈950 K) [10,  12] and the lowest losses at high microwave frequencies [13,14].
Some  years ago, a Gilbert damping parameter of 2.1 × 10−3 was measured for  a LiFe5O8 single-crystal [13], and a more recent study has reported a  value as low as 1.3 × 10−3 for an epitaxial LiFe5O8 thin film, drawing  attention to this material as a promising candidate for spintronic ap­ plications.
Other applications of LiFe5O8 include gas sensing or anode  material for Li-ion batteries [15,16].
A good number of studies on both lithium ferrite phases have been  cited above, in which single-crystals, thin films or powder samples are  studied based on a plethora of characterization techniques, e.g. X-ray  and neutron diffraction, Raman, infrared and M¨ossbauer spectroscopy,  scanning and transmission electron microscopy, etc., as well as various  physical property measurement, e.g., charge-discharge voltage profiles,  ferromagnetic resonance, magnetic hysteresis, N ´e el/Curie temperature  determination, dielectric properties, etc.
Generally speaking, an appro­ priate and accurate quantification of the Li content is often lacking.
The  reduced number of electrons in lithium makes it difficult to quantify  based on the characterization techniques routinely employed to deter­ mine the elemental composition of materials [17].
However, lithium  quantification is rather critical given that the Li-content has been  demonstrated to have a great influence over some physical properties  [18], therefore conditioning the performance of functional devices  based on lithium ferrites.
Moreover, Li has been seen to have a tendency  to escape through evaporation promoted by the elevated temperatures  generally employed in the material preparation [14].
In this work, lithium ferrite powders with different Li:Fe ratios have  been synthesized.
The powders have subsequently conformed into pel­ lets and sintered following a traditional ceramic processing method.
Elemental composition of the samples has been extracted from Ruth­ erford backscattering spectroscopy combined with nuclear reaction  analysis (RBS-NRA), Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction  (PXRD) data has yielded quantitative phase and elemental compositions  as well as unit cell dimensions for the different phases present in each  sample, while the samples homogeneity has been investigated by  confocal Raman microscopy (CRM).
All mentioned techniques demon­ strate with good agreement that the phase composition of the powders is  essentially maintained on the sintered ceramics, which is crucial in  terms of the material functionality.
Microstructural analysis has shed  light on the processes that occur during sintering of the ceramics,  evidencing the role of the Li-content of the starting powders.
The mag­ netic properties of the ceramics have been investigated through  vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements at RT. 2.
Experimental methods  2.1.
Sample preparation  Appropriate amounts of Li2CO3 and α-Fe2O3 (≥99% and ≥96%,  Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed to attain Li:Fe ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5.
The  dry powders were mixed using a LabRAM resonant acoustic mixer from  Resodyn (80 g, 1 min at ≈61.5 Hz, max. acceleration = 63 G’s).
The  mixture was thermally treated in air atmosphere (4 h at 900 ◦C) in a  laboratory furnace.
Synthesis heating profiles may be found in Fig. S1a  in the Supporting Information (SI).
The synthesis treatment was opti­ mized based on previous experiments (not shown here) so that a cubic  phase with as low unit cell parameter as possible is obtained for the 1:5  Li:Fe ratio mixture (LiFe5O8 a ≈8.33 Å) [13,19,20], given that too low  temperature is reported to yield hematite (hexagonal/rhombohedral)  and too high temperature have been seen to produce magnetite (cubic, a  ≈8.39 Å) [21].
The expected reactions for each Li:Fe ratio are: [22,23].
Li : Fe = 1 : 1 ⇒Li2CO3 + Fe2O3→2LiFeO2 + CO2↑ (1) Li : Fe = 1 : 3 ⇒Li2CO3 + 3Fe2O3→LiFeO2 + LiFe5O8 + CO2↑ (2) Li : Fe = 1 : 5 ⇒Li2CO3 + 5Fe2O3→2LiFe5O8 + CO2↑ (3) The obtained powders were gently grinded in an agate mortar,  yielding to three different powder samples, which will be subsequently  referred to as <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> , <Li-Fe 1–3 powd> and <Li-Fe 1–5  powd> .
The synthesized powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets  (ø=1 cm, 0.75 g powders, 6 wt% lubricant) using a stainless-steel die of  appropriate dimensions and a manual press from Tonindustrie (5 min,  125 MPa).
The pellets were then heated in air atmosphere (4 h at  1100 ◦C) in the same furnace used for the synthesis, now following a 3-  step thermal cycle previously reported to yield high-density LiFe5O8  pieces [24].
(see Fig. S1b for sintering heating profiles).
The obtained  ceramic samples are given the following IDs: <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> ,  <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> and <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> . 2.2.
Sample characterization  The elemental composition of the samples (Li, Fe, O) was evaluated  by means of ion beam analysis techniques.
RBS combined with NRA was  carried out at the 5 MV tandem accelerator at CMAM using H+ at  3.0 MeV [25].
A silicon barrier detector placed at a scattering angle of  150◦was used to measure the backscattering yield and the sample po­ sition was controlled with a three-axis goniometer.
For the measure­ ment, the pellets were grinded to powders using 800 grit dry SiC  sandpaper and the obtained powders were fixed on a carbon adhesive  tape.
The powder samples were directly mounted on the carbon tape.
The experimental conditions for the RBS-NRA measurements were  specifically chosen to detect and quantify the Li present in the sample.
In  particular, non-invasive characterization of the lithium content was  performed using the [7] Li(p,α)4He nuclear reaction, which  cross-section has a broad maximum at a proton energy of 3 MeV. This  nuclear reaction is considered the most suitable for lithium quantifica­ tion since the signal intensity is proportional to the amount of the  naturally occurring [7] Li isotope while yielding a high signal-to-noise  ratio [26].
The in-depth quantification and distribution of Li and all  the other elements in the samples were determined with the SIMNRA  simulation software package [27].
PXRD data were collected in the 2θ-range 14–78◦using a Bruker D8  Advance X-Ray diffractometer (ω-2θ diffraction scans) equipped with a  Lynx Eye detector and a Cu anode (Kα1(Cu)= 1.5406 Å) operated at  40 kV and 30 mA.
The powder samples were measured as-synthesized,  while the ceramics were ground into powders prior to the PXRD mea­ surement.
Rietveld analysis of the PXRD data was performed with the  software FullProf [28], using a Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt  function to describe the peak-profile [29].
The crystallographic phases  included in the Rietveld models were α-LiFeO2 (rock-salt structure,  Fm3m (225), a= 4.158(1) Å) [17] and α-LiFe5O8 (spinel structure, P4332  (212), a= 8.3339(1) Å) [30].
Find a detailed description of the phases in  Tables S1 and S2, respectively.
Notably, LiFe5O8 crystallizes in the or­ dered α-LiFe5O8 phase rather than the high-symmetry β-LiFe5O8 phase  (Fd3m) (see Fig. S3).
A NIST standard (LaB6 SRM® 660b) [31] was  measured in the same experimental conditions as the samples in order to  estimate the instrumental-contribution to the peak-broadening and a  Lorentzian isotropic size parameter was refined to describe the  sample-contribution to the broadening.
Refinements of the Rietveld  models yielded quantitative information on the samples (incl.
phase  composition, elemental analysis for the individual phases).
Phases lacking long-range order are not discernible based on  diffraction data.
Therefore, the samples were further characterized by  Raman spectroscopy to reveal possible non-crystalline phases.
In  C. Granados-Miralles et al. Journal of the European Ceramic Society 43 (2023) 3351–3359 3353 particular, the samples were investigated using a confocal Raman sys­ tem (WITec ALPHA 300RA) in which the spectrometer is coupled with  an optical microscope, allowing recording spatially-resolved Raman  data (2D-Raman maps).
The measurements were performed at RT with a  linearly p-polarized Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) and a 100x objective lens  (NA=0.95).
A low laser excitation power (0.5 mW) was used to avoid  sample damage and/or overheating.
Representative Raman spectra were  obtained from averaging single spectra recorded every 200 nm (expo­ sure time = 2 s) throughout an area of at least 5 × 5 µm2.
Several re­ gions of powdered samples were measured in order to analyze their  homogeneity.
Raman results were analyzed by using WITec Project Plus  Software.
In all cases, Raman spectra were normalized to the highest  intensity vibration mode.
A fraction of the pellets was ground into  powders with an agate mortar, while the powder samples were  measured as-synthesized.
The density of the ceramics was determined by the Archimedes’  method in distilled water at 25 ◦C. Theoretical densities were calculated  for all samples using the refined phase compositions and unit cell di­ mensions extracted from Rietveld analysis of the PXRD data.
Relative  densities were calculated dividing measured (Archimedes) by calculated  (theoretical) density values.
The morphology and microstructure of the samples were investi­ gated based on secondary electron images of FE-SEM using a Hitachi S-  4700 microscope.
Fresh fractured surfaces were imaged for the ceramic  samples.
The powders were measured directly.
Grain size distributions  and average grain sizes for both powders and pellets were extracted  from the FE-SEM images using the software ImageJ [32].
A hot-stage microscope (HSM) from Hesse Instruments with an EMI  image analysis and data processing software allowed extracting dilato­ metric curves for <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> and <Li-Fe 1–5 powd> , which  served to study the sintering kinetics of LiFeO2 and LiFe5O8, respec­ tively.
For HSM measurements, the sample was placed on an alumina  substrate and heated up to 1500 ◦C with a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min.  RT magnetic hysteresis of the dense ceramics was investigated using  a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) from Microsense (model EZ 7).
The cylindrical pellets were mounted on a quartz rod with a quartz disk  on one end onto which the samples were fixed with Teflon tape.
VSM  measurements were performed at RT in a field range of up to 2.1 T.  Saturation magnetization, Ms, and coercive field, Hc, values are extrac­ ted from the measured hysteresis loops; Ms being the magnetization  value at the maximum applied field (i.e., Ms = M(2.1 T)) and Hc the H-  field value at M= 0. 3.
Results and discussion  3.1.
Elemental and phase composition.
Structural characterization  Three compositions were prepared using Li:Fe ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and  1:5 in the form of powders and ceramics.
Fig. 1a shows the RBS-NRA  spectra measured for the three powders.
In the figure, the surface sig­ nals from O, Fe and Li are marked by arrows and the Li signal has been  magnified on the inset.
The measured RBS-NRA spectra show notable  differences in terms of the metallic content for the various samples.
For  instance, <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> seems to have significantly more Li than  the other two samples while the Fe signal appears diminished, as ex­ pected from the Li:Fe ratios used in the synthesis.
Aiming at quantifying  these differences in elemental composition, and particularly in the Li:Fe  content, relevant RBS-NRA spectra have been simulated using the  SIMNRA commercial code [27].
Measured and simulated spectra for a  representative sample (<Li-Fe 1–5 powd>) are displayed on Fig. 1b in  red and black color, respectively, illustrating the good agreement ach­ ieved between experiment and theory.
In Fig. 1b, the independent elemental contributions to the total  simulated spectrum are also represented.
In addition to the Li, Fe and O  present in the sample itself, C was also included in the simulations in  order to account for the contribution of the carbon tape on which the  powders were fixed for the measurement.
The cross-section input related  to the lithium nuclear reaction [7] Li(p,α)4He was extracted from Paneta  et al. [26] For C and O, the  12C(p,p)12C and  16O(p,p)16O  elastic-scattering cross-sections have been used [27].
The Rutherford  scattering cross section was used to simulate the Fe intensity.
As a consequence of the samples morphology (powders fixed on  carbon tape), the elemental signals of the spectrum show a continuous  decrease as the ion beam penetrates deeper in the sample (tails towards  lower energies), in contrast with the sharp peaks generally recorded for  thin films.
The elemental concentrations, determined by SIMRA simu­ lations, were included to fit the spectra.
The fit was carried out assuming  that the sample is composed by 10 different layers and a porosity of a  40%.
Additional fits (not shown here) of the RBS-NRA data have  demonstrated the porosity does not significantly affect the calculated  elemental composition.
Similar measurements and simulations were carried out for the  ceramic samples, producing alike results, although as it appears from the  spectra recorded for the pellets, these samples suffered a slight  contamination originating from the SiC sandpaper used to grind them to  powders for the measurement.
Thus, the accuracy of the quantification  is lower for the ceramics, as an additional contribution from Si had to be  included in the simulation.
Table 1 includes the Fe/Li ratios resulting  from the simulations for all powder and ceramic samples.
The obtained  Fe/Li values seem to indicate that the Li:Fe ratios of the starting mixtures  Fig. 1. (a) RBS-NRA spectra of the three powder samples.

C. Granados-Miralles et al.Journal of the European Ceramic Society 43 (2023) 3351–3359 3354 are essentially maintained after both the synthesis at 900 ◦C and sin­ tering at 1100 ◦C, within the calculated errors.
Preparation of Li ferrites  through conventional ceramic methods has been traditionally avoided,  as the high temperatures required for sintering have been seen to pro­ mote the evaporation of Li.
[14] However, this has not been the case for  the samples under study here, as the Li-content determined on the ce­ ramics is comparable to the Fe/Li ratios of 1, 3 and 5 employed for the  synthesis.
A possible explanation for stoichiometry preservation in the  present samples is the optimization of the ceramic processing carried out  here, yielding powders with stoichiometric composition, good crystal­ linity and particle sizes which allow sintering at a relatively low  temperature.
The measured PXRD patterns were fitted to Rietveld models con­ taining two phases: α-LiFeO2 (rock-salt structure) and α-LiFe5O8 (spinel  structure).
Fig. 2a shows the fit for a representative sample (see Fig. S2  for remaining samples).
Here, the experimental data is represented by  the grey symbols while Rietveld models for LiFeO2 and LiFe5O8 are  represented by the red and green lines, respectively.
The total Rietveld  model is the sum of these two individual phases (not shown in the figure)  and the discrepancy between the data and the total model is depicted by  the black line at the bottom.
The bar graph in Fig. 2c illustrates the  composition of each sample in mass percentage (wt%).
Pure LiFeO2 and  LiFe5O8 powders are obtained from Li:Fe ratios of 1:1 and 1:5, respec­ tively.
Subsequent sintering of the 1:5 powders do not seem to affect  phase composition while a small fraction of LiFe5O8 arises in the 1:1  sample.
The 1:3 Li:Fe ratio leads to coexistence of the two phases in the  powder sample: LiFe5O8 as the main phase, with 83(1) wt%, and a 16.9  (8) wt% of LiFeO2.
After the sintering treatment applied to the 1:3  powders, the minority phase content increases up to 23.4(9) wt%.
The refined cell dimensions for the rock-salt phase are in good  agreement with the reported for LiFeO2 (see values in Table S3) [17].
Refined cell parameters for the spinel phase are plotted in Fig. 2b.
While  all values are within the expected range for LiFe5O8, sample <Li-Fe 1–5  ceram> presents a greater value than all the other samples.
This small  shift towards larger unit cell dimensions may be understood based on  the greater Fe-content of this sample compared to the others (see Table 1  and Table S4), given that the isostructural iron oxide magnetite Fe3O4 is  8.3985(5) Å, [33] although further characterization by means of e.g.  M¨ossbauer spectroscopy is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
The large  uncertainty on the cell dimensions reported for <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> is  due to the low concentration of LiFe5O8 present in this sample.
As a last stage of the data refinement, atomic occupancies were  refined for the metal cations, while the oxygen sites were assumed fully  occupied, and from the refinements, the lithium content was calculated.
The lithium content on each phase is defined as x in Fig. 3a, x repre­ senting the chemical subscript corresponding to Li in the phases defined  as LixFe1-xO2 and LixFe5-xO8 (check Table S4 for numerical values).
In  the theoretical LiFeO2 structure, Li+ and Fe3+ are equally distributed  filling the 4a Wyckoff position (see Table S1 for full phase description).
In this work, the occupancies of both atomic positions were refined,  revealing that the 4a position has a slight Li-deficiency in all the samples  studied (see red symbols in Fig. 3a).
The x calculated for the rock-salt  phase ranges from 0.84(2) to 0.942(9), slightly below the theoretical  value of 1.
One could say that the Li-content in LiFeO2 tends to drop as  Table 1  Fe/Li ratios obtained from the simulated RBS-NRA spectra and from Rietveld  refinements of PXRD data for the different samples.

C. Granados-Miralles et al.Journal of the European Ceramic Society 43 (2023) 3351–3359 3355 the amount of Fe used in the synthesis increases but the calculated un­ certainties do not really allow drawing a clear trend.
For the LiFe5O8 phase, it has been previously reported that the Li+ cations have a tendency to lodge at the octahedral positions of the  structure [13,34,35].
Therefore, in the Rietveld models of the present  work, the tetrahedral sites (8c) were always fully occupied by Fe3+.
On  the other hand, the Li+ and Fe3+ content on the octahedral sites (with  Wyckoff symbols 4a and 12d, respectively) was refined so that the two  cations could freely swap with one another as long as both sites  remained fully occupied.
The obtained trends for the Li-content in the  spinel phase are displayed in green color in Fig. 3a.
For all samples, the  chemical subscript for Li, x, is fairly close to the theoretical value of 1  (within a ± 0.05 uncertainty).
For sample <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> , the low  significance of the LiFe5O8 phase did not allow for refining atomic oc­ cupancies.
Similar to the rock-salt scenario, no clear trend is identified  for the Li content in the spinel phase, although the obtained results lay in  all cases within ± 5% of the theoretical value.
An overall Fe-to-Li content has been calculated considering the  refined coefficients and weight fractions for each phase, and they are  plotted in Fig. 3b as a function of the Fe/Li ratios used in the synthesis.
The calculated ratios correlate well with the nominal compositions,  although the calculated values for <Li-Fe 1–3 powd> and <Li-Fe 1–3  ceram> (i.e., 4.3(2) and 3.9(2), respectively) are above the expected  value of 3.
The Fe/Li values calculated from the RBS-NRA simulations  are also plotted in Fig. 3b for comparative purposes.
The results from  both techniques are in very good agreement for both end compositions,  although a discrepancy in the Li-Fe 1–3 samples is noted.
It is worth  noting that the discrepancy is observed for the samples that have a  mixture of phases, while the agreement is better for samples in which  one phase predominates.
Averaged Raman spectra of the powders and ceramics on represen­ tative superficial regions are displayed in Fig. 4a.
The Raman signal  corresponding to <Li-Fe 1–3 powd> and <Li-Fe 1–5 powd> are very  similar to one another, showing Raman vibrational modes at 128, 202,  237, 264, 301, 322, 259, 282, 403, 440, 493, 521, 553, 611, 666 and  713 cm−1.
These modes can be associated with the LiFe5O8 spinel phase,  and more specifically, with the α polymorph, for which 6A1 +14E +20F2  phonon Raman modes are allowed [13,20,22].
In addition, some bands  at larger wavenumbers are observed, at around 1161 and 1376 cm−1,  which are attributed to second-order modes [22].
The spectrum  measured for <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> is completely different from the other  two powder samples.
In this case, three broad vibrational modes are  identified at 180, 394 and 624 cm−1.
This spectrum can be attributed to  the LiFeO2 rock-salt phase [1,36,37].
From the group factor analysis,  Fig. 3. (a) Lithium content on LiFeO2 (red) and LiFe5O8 (green).

(c) Main Raman spectra  recognized in the Raman mapping from figure  b, corresponding to the rock-salt and spinel  phases (in red and green color, respectively).
In  figure c, the allowed Raman modes for the rock-  salt phase are indexed.
For the spinel phase, A1  and F2 Raman modes are identified with the  corresponding tags while untagged bands  correspond to E vibrational modes.
C. Granados-Miralles et al.Journal of the European Ceramic Society 43 (2023) 3351–3359 3356 two phonon modes are active in Raman: A1 + Eg.
The Raman band at  394 cm−1 (Eg) is attributed to the O–Fe–O bending while the vibrational  mode at 624 cm−1 (A1) corresponds to the Fe–O stretching mode of FeO6  octahedra.
The vibrational band at around 180 cm−1 can be assigned to  the Li-cage in an octahedral environment, as identified by C. Julien in  Raman spectra for similar materials, i.e, LiMO2 (M= Ni, Co, Cr) [37].
Finally, similar to the spinel structure, a band around 1276 cm−1 related  to an overtone is also visible.
With respect to the sintered pellets fabricated from the powder  samples, vibrational modes for <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> and <Li-Fe 1–5  ceram> are corresponding to the LiFe5O8 phase while <Li-Fe 1–1  ceram> presents a convolution of the two identified Raman spectra:  LiFe5O8 + LiFeO2.
Subtle changes in the position, full width high  maximum (FWHM) and intensity of the Raman bands are noted when  comparing powder and ceramic samples.
The fluctuations in the relative  intensities of the bands can be attributed to different crystallographic  orientations of the grains, while the subtle differences in position and  FWHM may be associated with slight changes on the grain sizes or small  strain that may be induced in the structure during the synthesis or sin­ tering processes.
No binary Li or Fe oxides are identified in any sample [38,39].
With the aim of gaining semi-quantitative information on the con­ centration and distribution of each of the phases, spatially-resolved  analysis of the confocal Raman data has been carried out.
Fig. 4b  shows the corresponding analysis for sample <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> .
Fig. 4b (right) shows the in-plane Raman image corresponding to the  region marked on the optical image from the left.
In the 2D Raman  image, two distinct phases are discriminated, with regions colored in red  and green corresponding to the rock-salt and spinel phases, respectively.
From both the Raman and optical images, it is roughly estimated that the  rock-salt phase accounts for about 1/3 of the total surface mapped,  which is in rather good agreement with the 23.4(9) wt% extracted from  Rietveld analysis for that phase in sample <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> .
Raman  map analysis for the remaining the samples may be found in Fig. S4,  yielding results compatible with those from Rietveld analysis.
Average Raman spectra corresponding to the two colored regions  from Fig. 4b are plotted in Fig. 4c in matching colors.
In Fig. 4c, the rock-  salt Raman spectrum (red) has been multiplied by a factor 5 to achieve  an overall intensity comparable to that of the spinel one (green).
The  need for this x5 factor highlights the great difference in Raman cross  section of these two phases.
As a consequence of this imbalance between  phases, the average Raman spectra for the samples in this work do not  give a good idea of the actual concentration of each phase.
This explains  why the average Raman spectrum for <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> , plotted at the  bottom of Fig. 4a, gives the impression of a nearly pure LiFe5O8 sample,  despite being calculated from the superficial region shown in Fig. 4b,  with a clear contribution from LiFeO2.
The same happens for the cor­ responding powder sample Li-Fe 1–3 powd> .
This is even more  noticeable for <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> , which according to PXRD is nearly  single-phase LiFeO2 (96(2) wt%) while the averaged Raman spectra  shown in Fig. 4a seems to be predominantly spinel phase.
Spatially-  resolved analysis of the data removes some of the uncertainties that  might derive from phase identification based on average Raman spectra  exclusively, evidencing the need for Raman mapping experiments. 3.2.
Particle size distribution, morphology and densification  Fig. 5a-c show FE-SEM micrographs for the three powder samples.
In  all three cases, relatively loose particles with fairly isotropic morphology  are observed.
Particle sizes extracted from the micrographs were suc­ cessfully fitted to a lognormal distribution, yielding similar mean values  of ≈600 nm for all three powders (within uncertainties, see Table 2).
Size distributions differ to some extent, with <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> show­ ing a wider distribution with somewhat more representation of large  sizes than <Li-Fe 1–3 powd> , and the latter also more than <Li-Fe 1–5  powd> .
The microstructure of fresh fractured surfaces of the ceramics is  shown in Fig. 5d-f.
For <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> (Fig. 5d), the former particle  morphology has evolved to grains with irregular morphology and  faceted grain boundaries which are interconnected through sintering  necks.
The grains have experimented some growth, reaching a mean  value of 3.8(6) µm, which proves insufficient to eliminate the inter­ connected porosity observed in the sample.
The fracture is mainly  intergranular, suggesting that mass transport during sintering is limited  to coalescence of clusters of particles.
All these evidences are indicative  of an early sintering stage, which is also in agreement with the  Fig. 5. FE-SEM micrographs for (a) <Li-Fe 1–1 powd> , (b) <Li-Fe 1–3 powd> , (c) <Li-Fe 1–5 powd> , (d) <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> , (e) < Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> and (f) <Li-  Fe 1–5 ceram> .

C. Granados-Miralles et al.Journal of the European Ceramic Society 43 (2023) 3351–3359 3357 temperature behavior displayed by the powders employed to fabricate  this ceramic.
As shown by the shrinkage curve for <Li-Fe 1–1  powd> extracted from hot-stage microscopy measurements (see  Fig. S5a), at the sintering temperature used (i.e., 1100 ◦C), mass trans­ port is rather limited and the compound has barely started shrinking,  < 8%.
The sintering process has reached a more advanced stage for <Li-  Fe 1–3 ceram> (Fig. 5e), with appearance of grains with large sizes,  although the lognormal mean value of 3.4(2) µm is, within uncertainties,  equivalent to that for the 1–1 ceramic (see Table 2).
The microstructure  of <Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> is a combination of the observed for the 1–1 and  1–5 ceramics –not surprising given the mixed composition of this in­ termediate sample– and a mixture of both intra- and intergranular  fractured surfaces are found.
<Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> (Fig. 5f) has come to a  much further sintering stage than the other two ceramics.
Characteristic  3-point junctions with 120◦angles appear for <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> ,  indicating the sintering process approaches its final stage [40].
In the  1–5 ceramic, the grains have grown substantially –finding particles over  30 µm in diameter– and size distribution expands considerably.
A mean  grain size of 10(2) µm is extracted for the lognormal fit.
The fractured  surface of <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> is clearly intragranular, as expected when  grain growth occurs during sintering.
All this is again understood based  on the shrinkage curve of <Li-Fe 1–5 powd> (see Fig. S5b), which ev­ idences that for this composition, the greatest mass transport (and in  turn, the maximum densification speed) takes place at a temperature  near the sintering point (i.e., 1100 ◦C).
A pronounced grain growth generally comes as a consequence of a  fast grain boundary mobility.
As grain boundary mobility is typically  faster than the processes required to remove the air between particles, it  is common for pores to appear in these conditions.
For <Li-Fe 1–5  ceram> , a great number of trapped pores are visible and different stages  of pore coalescence are found (see Fig. 5f).
Similar pores have been  previously observed on sintered LiFe5O8 samples [41–43].
Coalescence  of intragranular pores and subsequent pore removal involves displace­ ment of the air trapped in the pores towards the surface, and conse­ quently, it requires much more energy than grain boundary diffusion.
Hence, the rapid grain growth observed here suggests that, in this sys­ tem, mass transport during sintering is assisted by grain boundary  diffusion, while pore coalescence may occur only to a small extent.
Li  has a high vapor pressure at the selected sintering temperature and  therefore, one could expect vapor transport processes to be favored for  these materials [44].
However, the preservation of the Li-content after  sintering denotes that vapor-phase assisted processes must not be  dominant at the selected sintering temperature, although small contri­ butions from such processes to the mass transport cannot be completely  ruled out.
While the presence of intragranular pores is especially relevant for  <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> , a few of these pores are also visible in <Li-Fe 1–3  ceram> while no pores are found in <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> .
This together  with the grain growth observed for each sample, suggests that mass  transport diffusion must be much more favorable in LiFe5O8 than in  LiFeO2, despite the fact that the latter has a higher proportion of Li.
This  is counterintuitive a priori, given that Li-cations are known for their high  mobility, which would in principle be expected to favor mass transport.
A possible explanation of this phenomenon could reside on the crystal  structures of these two materials.
In both rock-salt and spinel structures,  Li+ cations occupy the octahedral sites defined by six O2- anions.
The Li-  O bond distances extracted from Rietveld analysis of PXRD data (see  Table 2) are shorter for LiFeO2 than for LiFe5O8, meaning that Li-cations  are less strongly bound to the oxygen anions in the spinel structure,  which might be the reason why diffusion is greater in LiFe5O8, in spite of  its lower Li-content.
The relative densities measured for the ceramic samples (see Table 2)  are in good agreement with the sintering stage attained for each.
Thus,  the density is greater for <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> than for <Li-Fe 1–3  ceram> , while the lowest value is measured for <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> .
In  all three cases, the attained densities ensure a good mechanical integrity,  which together with the Li:Fe stoichiometry preservation demonstrated,  makes them suitable for many applications, including their use as targets  for thin-film deposition by means of e.g. sputter or pulsed-laser depo­ sition (PLD).
This is of great use considering many of the applications of  Li ferrites require a thin-film morphology.
Density improvement is  generally expected from increasing the sintering temperature, however,  a higher working temperature would increase the Li-cation partial  pressure, very likely altering the Li:Fe ratio of the produced ceramic.
Based on the sintering mechanisms inferred from the FE-SEM micro­ structural analysis, it follows that density betterment should come from  strategies promoting mass transport through surface diffusion mecha­ nisms while retaining the Li-cation partial pressure as low as possible.
In  particular, the use of additives on the surface of the particles of alike  systems has been previously proposed as a suitable route to reduce the  sintering temperature and allow an effective control of grain growth [41,45,46].
However, the present work demonstrates that that optimi­ zation of the ceramic processing also allows producing dense ceramics  with stoichiometry preservation, which is key for their technological  application. 3.3.
Magnetic properties  Magnetization, M, as a function of an externally applied magnetic  field, Happ, has been measured at RT on the ceramic samples and the  recorded hysteresis loops are plotted in Fig. 6. <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram­ > exhibits a low-coercivity cycle, as expected for a soft ferrimagnet  (FiM) such as LiFe5O8.
Both Raman microscopy and powder diffraction  agree upon this sample being phase-pure LiFe5O8, and the saturation  magnetization, Ms, of 61.5(1) Am2/kg measured here fits well into this  scenario – the Ms values reported for dense LiFe5O8 pieces span within  57–63 Am2/kg [23,47,48].
From CRM and PXRD it follows that LiFeO2  is the majority phase in <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> .
LiFeO2 is an antiferro­ magnet (AFM) with an ordering temperature below RT, and therefore,  no hysteretic behavior is to be expected for this material at RT.
A small  hysteresis loop is recorded for <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> (see red curves in  Fig. 6), which can only arise from the little LiFe5O8 present in the sample  (4.4(3) wt% according to Rietveld analysis).
In this case, the Ms value is  almost null, given the predominance of the paramagnetic (PM) phase  and low concentration of FiM material.
<Li-Fe 1–3 ceram> is a mixture  of the two magnetic materials described above (77(1) wt% LiFe5O8, 23.4  (9) wt% LiFeO2 according to diffraction).
It presents a hysteresis curve  similar to that of <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> , only the Ms decreases down to  47.2(1) Am2/kg.
Phase composition (wt% LiFe5O8) for each sample can  be roughly estimated from the measured Ms with the formula  Table 2 Lognormal mean particle/grain sizes obtained from FE-SEM.

The results from these calculations –collected in   Table 3, along with the Ms values– are in very good agreement with the  wt% LiFe5O8 obtained from Rietveld analysis of PXRD data (see Fig. 2c).
Unfortunately, the coercivity, Hc, values extracted from the curves  are near the resolution limit of the measurement.
During the measure­ ment, the Happ was swept in steps of 2 mT, so this is considered as the  measurement error.
Therefore, we cannot rigorously determine any Hc  < 4 mT, although a clear difference between <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> and  <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> is qualitatively observed.
Note that even though the  Hc in <Li-Fe 1–1 ceram> is a consequence of the LiFe5O8 present in the  sample, the Hc measured here is much higher than that for the phase-  pure material.
Such magnetic hardening (increase in Hc) can be  explained if picturing the sample as a set of small deposits of FiM ma­ terial (LiFe5O8) dispersed through a non-magnetic matrix (LiFeO2).
The  dilution of ferri- or ferromagnetic (FiM, FM) particles reduces the  dipolar interaction among them, causing an enhancement of Hc; this  effect has been previously reported and is well understood [49,50].
On  the other hand, the coercivity value measured for <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> is  much lower (see Fig. 6 inset), which is believed to be closely related to  the severe grain growth this sample undergoes as a consequence of the  sintering treatment at 1100 ◦C, clearly yielding the FiM material in a  multi-domain magnetic configuration.
Besides the pores mentioned  earlier, the grains in <Li-Fe 1–5 ceram> seem fairly continuous and  homogeneous (see FE-SEM in Fig. 5f), as also demonstrated by the rather  high density of the piece (relative density of 92.7(6)%).
This micro­ structure heavily favors the motion of the magnetic domain walls  throughout the large grains, which is known to be the most probable  mechanism for magnetization reversal in bulk samples [12,51].
Low-hampered domain wall motion implies a rapid propagation of any  disturbance caused by an external field, therefore diminishing the co­ ercive field of the material.
Previously reported Hc values for dense  LiFe5O8 pellets are considerably scattered, ranging between 0.4 and 16  mT [23,24,35,48,52], and similar values are found for powders [21,53,  54].
4. Conclusions  Lithium ferrite samples have been prepared as loose powders and  sintered ceramics, attaining a relative density of 92.7(6)% for a phase-  pure LiFe5O8 pellet.
The lithium content has been evaluated based on  Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy combined with nuclear reaction  analysis and Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data, in both  cases confirming that the Li:Fe ratios remain relatively steady during the  synthesis at 900 ◦C and sintering at 1100 ◦C, yielding a final dense  product with controlled lithium content.
This is in contrast with previ­ ous works reporting that the high temperatures required by conven­ tional ceramic methods promote lithium evaporation and yield Li-  deficient products.
Preservation of the Li:Fe stoichiometry of the ce­ ramics prepared here is attributed to a combination of both good quality  of the synthesized powders and the relatively low sintering temperature  employed.
The controlled stoichiometry and mechanical integrity of the  ceramics prepared here allows their direct utilization in bulk shape, in  addition to their use as targets for thin-films deposition.
Field emission  scanning electron microscopy has revealed the substantial grain growth  taking place during sintering, going from ≈600 nm powders to LiFeO2  and LiFe5O8 ceramics with mean sizes of 3.8(6) and 10(2) µm, respec­ tively.
Large pores have been detected on the ceramics, especially on the  phase-pure LiFe5O8 material, which have been attributed to an  increased grain boundary mobility by surface diffusion, also compatible  with the intense grain growth observed.
Additionally, the increased  mobility and rapid growth has been seen to be more favored for LiFe5O8  than for LiFeO2, despite the lower Li-content of the first.
The phase-pure  LiFe5O8 ceramic shows a soft ferrimagnetic hysteretic behavior with a  saturation magnetization of 61.5(1) Am2/kg while the pellet with Li:Fe  = 1:1 displays the antiferromagnetic behavior expected for LiFeO2.
Phase compositions estimated from the measured Ms are in good  agreement with that obtained from Rietveld analysis of PXRD data.
