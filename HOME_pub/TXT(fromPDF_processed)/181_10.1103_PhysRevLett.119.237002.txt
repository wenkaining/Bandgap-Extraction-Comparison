Link between the Superconducting Dome and Spin-Orbit Interaction in the (111) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 Interface P. K. Rout, E. Maniv, and Y. Dagan* Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel (Received 6 June 2017; published 4 December 2017) We measure the gate voltage (Vg) dependence of the superconducting properties and the spin-orbit interaction in the (111)-oriented LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface.
Superconductivity is observed in a dome- shaped region in the carrier density-temperature phase diagram with the maxima of superconducting transition temperature Tc and the upper critical fields lying at the same Vg.
The spin-orbit interaction determined from the superconducting parameters and confirmed by weak-antilocalization measurements follows the same gate voltage dependence as Tc.
The correlation between the superconductivity and spin- orbit interaction as well as the enhancement of the parallel upper critical field, well beyond the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit, suggest that superconductivity and the spin-orbit interaction are linked in a nontrivial fashion.
We propose possible scenarios to explain this unconventional behavior.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.237002 Oxide heterostructures provide unique platform where various degrees of freedom from the constituent materials can combine such that new collective phenomena emerge at the interfaces [1].
An interesting example is a two- dimensional (2D) electron liquid at the interface between (100)-oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 that exhibits gate tunable superconductivity [2–4] and spin-orbit interaction [4–6].
Recent experiments on (111) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 have shown 2D conduction [7–9] and superconductivity with a transition temperature (Tc) of about 100 mK [10,11].
In a (111)-oriented LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface, the cubic lattice is projected onto the (111) plane of the interface, resulting in a 2D sixfold crystalline structure.
Angle- resolved photoemission studies on the (111) SrTiO3 surface reveal a sixfold symmetric electronic structure [12,13].
This 2D crystalline symmetry is also reflected in the magnetotransport properties [9] and has been predicted to host exotic electronic orders [14–17].
At low temper- atures, this symmetry is lowered, since bulk SrTiO3 undergoes multiple structural transitions.
Below 105 K, a transition from a cubic to a tetragonal phase occurs [18].
The symmetry is further reduced to triclinic below ∼70 K, and polar domain walls where inversion symmetry is broken are created [19].
Such a domain wall can be pinned to the interface, resulting in unconventional superconduc- tivity, which is linked to spin-orbit coupling.
In a 2D superconductor, for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the superconducting plane, superconduc- tivity is broken when vortices become closely packed.
By contrast, the parallel upper critical field (Hc∥) is determined by the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit [20,21], which is set by comparing the Zeeman energy to the superconducting gap.
In the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, this upper bound is relaxed [22,23].
In this Letter, we report a nonmonotonic (dome-shaped) dependence of Tc with a gate voltage in the (111) SrTiO3=LaAlO3 interfaces.
From the gate dependence of Tc and Hc∥, we estimate the spin-orbit energy (εSO), which follows the nonmonotonic behavior of Tc.
Remarkably, we found similar behavior for the spin-orbit field HSO extracted from weak antilocalization measurements.
Epitaxial films of LaAlO3 were deposited on an atomi- cally flat SrTiO3 (111) substrate using pulsed laser dep- osition.
The details of the deposition procedure and substrate treatment are described in Ref. [9].
We control the layer-by-layer growth of 14 monolayers (LaO3=Al layers) by reflection high-energy electron diffraction oscil- lations.
The atomic force microscope images show the step and terrace morphology of the film with step heights of 0.22 nm.
The electrical measurements with the current along the ½11¯2 direction were carried out in a Leiden Cryogenics custom-made dilution refrigerator.
Figure 1(a) presents the temperature-dependent sheet resistance RS (T) at various gate voltages Vg.
A clear gate- dependent superconducting transition is observed.
We define the critical temperature Tc as the temperature at which RS reaches half of its value at 350 mK. The normal state resistance RS (350 mK) decreases monotonically with increasing Vg [Fig. 1(b)], which is consistent with previous reports [8,9].
The monotonic increase of RS is contrasted with the nonmonotonic dependence of Tc on Vg.
A similar dome-shaped region in the carrier density-temperature phase diagram is seen in many unconventional super- conductors and in the (100) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface.
In the (100) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface, the Hall coef- ficient depends nonmonotonically on the gate voltage.
Surprisingly, this nonmonotonic behavior is also seen in the gate dependence of the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation (SdH) frequency.
Both the SdH frequency and low field inverse Hall coefficient follow the gate dependence of Tc for the (100) interface [3,24], or the superconductivity starts PRL 119, 237002 (2017) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 8 DECEMBER 2017 0031-9007=17=119(23)=237002(5) 237002-1 © 2017 American Physical Societyappearing when the low field inverse Hall coefficient decreases from its maximum value [25].
By contrast, for the (111) interface the inverse Hall coefficient monoton- ically decreases with Vg [Fig. 1(c)] consistent with previous observations [8,9].
In the case of the (111) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface, the titanium t2g bands are split into low and high spin states due to the atomic spin-orbit interaction [14,15].
We have shown that the lower spin state is first populated when accumulating electrons with increasing Vg [9].
This two-band scenario complicates the interpretation of the Hall data.
We have estimated the amount of carrier density modulation due to the electric field effect similar to Refs. [2,26].
Since the Vg range used is relatively small, the nonlinearities in the dielectric constant (ϵ) can be neglected, and thus the corresponding modulation of electron density is ≃1.3 × 1013 cm−2 with ϵ ≃15000.
This value is much smaller than the net change in 1=jeRHj of ≃4.3 × 1013 cm−2.
Moreover, the electron density due to the field effect increases with Vg in contrast to the observed behavior in Fig. 1(c).
All these observations indicate the presence of a hole band in addition to electron band(s) in the (111) interface.
We have confirmed this scenario by analyzing the normal state transport data via a simplistic noninteracting two-band model with one hole and one electron band (see Ref.
[27] for more details).
Therefore, it is possible that the hole contribution to the electronic transport (and perhaps to superconductivity) becomes important in this Vg range [8].
This is also consistent with the polar structure of the (111) interface [7].
The sheet resistance versus magnetic field at 90 mK for various gate voltages is plotted in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) for perpendicular and parallel field configurations, where the sample is properly aligned with the field within an accuracy of 2°.
We define the critical field (Hc⊥) for the perpendicular magnetic field configuration such that RSðHc⊥Þ ¼ RSð350 mKÞ=2, and a similar criterion is followed for Hc∥[28].
In Fig. 2(c), we plot Hc∥and Hc⊥as a function of Vg, both exhibiting nonmonotonic (c) (b) (a) FIG.

Such strong anisotropy between two field orienta- tions is evidence for 2D superconductivity in the (111) interface.
Thus, it is expected that the superconducting layer thickness (d) should be smaller than the Ginzburg- Landau coherence length (ξGL).
To check this, we extract ξGL from Hc⊥using the relation ξGL ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Φ0=2πHc⊥ p .
It is presented in Fig. 2(d) together with its extrapolation to zero temperature using Hc⊥ðTÞ ¼ Hc⊥ð0Þð1 −T=TcÞ valid for a 2D superconductor.
Since the parallel magnetic field fully penetrates a 2D (d ≪ξ) superconductor, we can only estimate the upper limit for d denoted as ¯d, which can be found from ¯d ¼ ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p Φ0=πξGLHc∥[see Fig. 2(d)].
We note that, for all Vg, ¯d < ξGLð0Þ, rendering superconductivity in the (111) SrTiO3=LaAlO3 two dimensional.
For a parallel field configuration in a 2D superconductor, the orbital motion and vortices can be neglected, making the Zeeman energy the dominant pair-breaking effect.
This leads to an upper (Chandrasekhar-Clogston) limit of Hc∥ given by HP ¼ 3.5kBTc= ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p gμB (μB is the Bohr magneton) in the BCS weak coupling limit [20,21].
Assuming a gyromagnetic ratio of g ≃2, we observe Hc∥> HP for all gate voltages reaching a maximal ratio of ∼11 [Fig. 2(c)].
In the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit can be relaxed.
Other reasons for breaking this limit could be strong coupling superconductivity, many-body effects, and an anisotropic pairing mechanism.
To determine the spin-orbit interaction from Hc∥, we use a somewhat oversimplified picture of spin-orbit scattering that suppresses spin orientation by the Zeeman field [22].
For a strong spin-orbit interaction, Hc∥can be expressed in terms of the spin-orbit energy (εSO) as Hc∥¼ 0.602 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ εSO=kBTc p HP with εSO ¼ ℏ=τSO, and τSO is the spin-orbit scattering time.
Remarkably, this analysis reveals a nonmonotonic dependence of εSO on Vg as shown in Fig. 3(b).
This is the main finding of our Letter.
For (110) LaAlO3=SrTiO3, gate-independent spin-orbit coupling has been observed [29], perhaps because of the nonpolar structure of this interface.
The findings on the (110) interface are contrasted with our results of a strong and gate-tunable spin-orbit interaction for the (111) interface that follows the behavior of the superconducting dome.
A weaker correlation between spin-orbit coupling and Tc in the (100) interface can be deduced by combining Refs.
[4–6], where Hc∥is smaller.
To further confirm the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, we studied the perpendicular magnetoresistance well above Tc at 1.3 K [Fig. 3(a)].
For a 2D diffusive metallic system placed in a perpendicular magnetic field (H), the field- dependent quantum correction to conductivity ΔσðHÞ nor- malized by quantum conductance (σ0 ¼ 2e2 =h) can be expressed as [5,30] ΔσðHÞ σ0 ¼ Ψ  H Hi þ HSO  þ 1 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 −γ2 p Ψ  H Hi þ HSOð1 þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 −γ2 p Þ  − 1 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 −γ2 p Ψ  H Hi þ HSOð1 − ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 −γ2 p Þ  − AH2 1 þ CH2 ; ð1Þ (a) (b) (c) (d) FIG.

Hi and HSO are the inelastic and spin-orbit fields, respectively.
The classical orbital magnetoresistance contributes a Kohler term to Eq. (1) with the parameters A and C. Figure 3(c) shows Hi and HSO for different Vg (see Supplemental Material for the gate dependence of g, A, and C [27]).
Clearly, HSO > Hi for all Vg, suggesting that we are in the weak antilocalization regime [see Fig. 3(a)].
HSO from weak antilocalization [Fig. 3(c)] shows non- monotonic behavior similar to εSO inferred from super- conductivity [Fig. 3(b)], and, furthermore, they have a maximum value at the same gate voltage as Tc.
In general, the LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface has a compli- cated band structure involving multiple contributions from the titanium d bands [31,32].
Therefore, the extracted parameters from weak antilocalization do not correspond to an individual band; instead, an averaged value over all the bands should be considered [33].
We have extracted various averaged time scales, i.e., τSO, τi (inelastic time), and τ (elastic scattering time) [Fig. 3(d)].
The τSOðiÞ are related to HSOðiÞ determined from weak antilocalization as HSOðiÞ ¼ ℏ=4eDτSOðiÞ.
The effective diffusion coefficient (D) and τ are calculated using a naïve Drude model for a 2D electron gas (see Ref. [27]).
Using this analysis, we find that τSO depends linearly on τ−1 for Vg < −25 V [see the inset in Fig. 3(d)], while for Vg > −25 V both τSO and τ increase with Vg [Fig. 3(d)].
The low Vg regime (Vg < −25 V) is governed by a D’yakonov-Perel’-type spin-orbit relaxation mechanism for which τSO ∝τ−1.
In this scenario, the electron precesses around the spin-orbit field, which is changing due to momentum scattering at a typical time τ [34].
The high Vg regime, on the other hand, is characterized by τSO ∝τ, suggesting that the electron spin is coupled to the crystal momentum.
Interestingly, these two regimes separated by the point where τSO ≃τ and the maximum of Tc (and Hc∥) dome lies close to this Vg.
All these observations suggest the mixing of multiple bands in the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction for higher Vg.
This scenario concurs with our recent report of crystalline sixfold anisotropic magnetoresistance in the (111) interfaces [9], where the sixfold term appears as a result of another band with higher spin state J getting populated with increasing Vg.
It is therefore possible that the crystalline spin-orbit interaction becomes important close to this avoided band crossing region due to the orbital mixing [23,35].
This interaction becomes smaller as Vg is further increased away from the band crossing regime, resulting in a dome in the spin-orbit energy versus Vg.
Such a multiband effect can also lead to dome-shaped superconductivity with maximum Tc lying at this regime [as observed in Fig. 1(b)] similar to the case for the (100) interface [3].
A more exotic mechanism of superconductivity in the LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface involves the formation of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) state due to large spin-orbit coupling [36].
This can somewhat explain the nonmonotonic gate dependence of Hc∥and Tc with the maxima lying at τSO ¼ τ.
However, the Hc∥for a quasi-2D superconductor in a FFLO state is estimated to be at most 2.5 times the Chandrasekhar- Clogston limit [37], which is much lower than the observed values [see Fig. 2(c)].
Therefore, a full theoretical under- standing of the phenomenological link observed here between the superconducting dome and the spin-orbit energy is yet to be developed.
Salje et al. have found that for SrTiO3 below ∼70 K the tetragonal symmetry is lowered and the Sr atoms are displaced along the [111] direction, leading to the breaking of local inversion symmetry [19].
It is therefore possible that a (111) SrTiO3-based polar interface has such broken inversion symmetry in addition to conventional inversion symmetry breaking observed at polar oxide interfaces, which can result in an unconventional superconductivity.
It has been recently suggested that dichalcogenide mono- layers with hexagonal structure can be a realization of exotic Ising superconductivity where the spins are locked in an out-of-plane configuration due to the breaking of cen- trosymmetry [38–40].
We also note that the possibility for a nodeless time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting order parameter has been proposed for (111) SrTiO3-based interfaces from symmetry considerations [16].
In summary, the superconducting transition temperature Tc of the (111) LaAlO3=SrTiO3 interface has a nonmono- tonic dependence on the gate voltage.
Maximum Tc is found at the same gate voltage where maximal values of spin-orbit field HSO and spin-orbit energy εSO are observed.
HSO is extracted from weak antilocalization, while εSO is estimated from the superconducting properties.
The Hc∥ exceeds the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit by more than an order of magnitude due to a strong spin-orbit interaction.
We suggest that the crystalline spin-orbit interaction becomes important close to an avoided band crossing region.
In this regime, orbital mixing can lead to enhanced spin-orbit interaction and superconductivity, which become weaker as Vg is tuned away from this avoided band crossing regime.
This results in a dome in the spin-orbit energy (and Tc) versus Vg.
However, a deeper insight to the link between spin-orbit interaction and the superconducting dome requires a further development of theoretical models for this unique hexagonal oxide interface.

[28] For Vg ≤−40 V, the saturation resistance at a high field is significantly larger than the resistance at 350 mK (above Tc).
But these two quantities coincide for other gate voltages.
This may be related to the proximity to a super- conductor-to-insulator transition for lower Vg and will be discussed elsewhere.
