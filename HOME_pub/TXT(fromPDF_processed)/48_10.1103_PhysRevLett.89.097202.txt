Fourth-Order Magnetic Anisotropy and Tunnel Splittings in Mn12 from Spin-Orbit-Vibron Interactions Mark R. Pederson,1 Noam Bernstein,1 and Jens Kortus2 1Center for Computational Materials Science, Code 6390, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375 2MPI fu¬®r Festko¬®perforschung, Heisenbergstrasse 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany (Received 11 January 2002; published 9 August 2002) From density-functional-theory based methods, we calculate the vibrational spectrum of the Mn12O12COOH16H2O4 molecular magnet.
Calculated infrared intensities are in accord with experi- mental studies.
There have been no ab initio attempts at determining which interactions account for the fourth-order anisotropy.
We show that vibrationally induced distortions of the molecule contribute to the fourth-order anisotropy Hamiltonian and that the magnitude and sign of the effect (  6:2 K) is in good agreement with all experiments.
Vibrationally induced tunnel splittings in isotopically pure and natural samples are predicted.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.097202 PACS numbers: 75.45.+j, 75.30.Et, 75.50.Xx The possibility that vibrationally induced modiÔ¨Åcations of the spin-orbit interaction affect magnetic reorientation barriers has not been previously investigated.
A simple model captures the physics but quantitative determination of the coupling constants requires computationally de- manding density-functional theory (DFT) methods.
A model Hamiltonian for a single uniaxial anisotropic spin coupled to a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by H  zzS2z  1 2 P2  !

For this simple case, the interaction between vibra- tional and spin degrees of freedom always acts to further stabilize each M state, but the energy splitting between the jMj  S and M  0 states may be either enhanced or reduced depending on the derivatives of the  matrix.
A more detailed analysis of this Hamiltonian, given below, shows that it can also connect M and M 	 4 levels.
Further in a real system the normal modes depend on nuclear masses so isotope effects can lead to small changes in the barrier or, as discussed below, larger tunnel splittings in the anisotropy Hamiltonian.
Both the intrinsic fourth-order and isotope effects can mediate resonant tunneling of magnetization which is of great interest from the stand- point of quantum mechanics at the mesoscale [1‚Äì6].
In addition, the magnitudes of terms in the anisotropy Hamiltonian determine the suitability of nanoscale par- ticles for use in magnetic memory and quantum-computing applications [7,8].
In general, purely electronic contribu- tions to higher-order magnetic anisotropy scale as  1=2c24 (c  speed of light), but the spin-orbit-vibron contribution scales as  1=!2 1=2c24.
The large 1=!2 prefactor suggests this term could be dominant in high- symmetry bulk systems where second-order effects vanish by symmetry.
Recent experiments on Mn12O12COOCH316H2O2 molecular nanomagnets, commonly referred to as Mn12-Ac [1‚Äì6,9], provide an ideal system for understand- ing how vibrational degrees of freedom may enhance the magnetic barriers.
Many researchers have noted that the tunneling dynamics may be mediated by conventional spin-phonon interactions [10].
Further, recent experiments by Sushkov et al. [9] show some strong variation in infra- red (IR) spectra as a function of applied Ô¨Åeld suggesting a coupling between the spin and vibrational degrees of free- dom.
Accurate experiments have determined that this easy- axis uniaxial molecular magnet has a second-order anisot- ropy parameter of D  0:56 K and that the fourth-order contributions to the anisotropy Hamiltonian increase the barrier from 56 K to approximately 65 K [3,5,6].
Pederson and Khanna have combined DFT, spin-orbit coupling, and second-order perturbation theory to calculate the second- order parameter (D) and Ô¨Ånd D  0:557 K in excellent agreement with experimental measurements [11].
An esti- mate of the entirely electronic spin-orbit-induced fourth- order anisotropy may be obtained by comparing the barrier computed with spin-orbit treated within second-order per- turbation theory to that computed using exact diagonaliza- tion.
Within this approach, we Ô¨Ånd a fourth-order contribution to the barrier on the order of 1 K and that it acts to reduce rather than to enhance the barrier.
To determine if vibrational coupling is an important contribution to magnetic anisotropies in Mn12-Ac we have performed accurate DFT-based calculations on a single molecular unit.
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof gen- eralized-gradient approximation has been used for all cal- culations [12].
Using the methods discussed in Ref.
[13], the vibrational frequencies, vibrational eigenvectors, and IR and Raman spectra have been calculated.

Gaussian basis sets have been fully optimized for each atom using the methods of Ref. [16].
To determine the anisotropy Hamiltonian and the derivatives with respect to each normal mode, we calculate the anisotropy Hamiltonian H  P ab abSaSb for each of the 163 inequi- valent vibrational displacements using the method of Ref. [11].
The coefÔ¨Åcients xy for an arbitrary conÔ¨Ågura- tion of atoms are determined from matrix elements of the spin-orbit-coupling operator sandwiched between all pairs of occupied and unoccupied Kohn-Sham wave functions (squared) and appropriate energy difference denominators.
The wave functions and, thus, the anisotropy Hamiltonian depend on the geometry of the molecule.
Derivatives of the anisotropy matrix with respect to the jth normal mode [i.e., dab=dQj] may be determined using a Ô¨Ånite-difference approach.
We have ascertained that the partial-pseudo- potential-based anisotropy Hamiltonian for the equilibrium geometry reproduces the all-electron anisotropy Hamiltonian of Ref. [11].
To test the accuracy of the vibra- tional frequencies, we compare our calculated IR spectra, plotted in Fig. 1, directly to experimental measurements of Sushkov et al. [9].
The experiments measure the IR absorption of Mn12 crystals suspended in parafÔ¨Ån pellets at wave numbers ranging from 30 to 70 cm1 and from 140 to 650 cm1.
The experimental absorption peak at 38 cm1 has a clear corresponding feature in our calculations at 63 cm1.
The structure in the 140 to 300 cm1 range is well reproduced by the calculations: The small experimental peaks at 150, 170, and 200 cm1 correspond to simulated features at 144, 170, and 201 cm1, respectively, and the relative intensities are moderately well reproduced.
The small peak in the simulation at 180 cm1 can be tentatively identiÔ¨Åed in the experiment as a small peak at 185 cm1.
The structure between 215 and 235 cm1 in the experi- ment, consisting of a large peak, a small peak, and a large peak with a shoulder at high frequency, has a clear analogue in the simulation results between 230 and 260 cm1 with similar relative intensities.
The intense peak at 255 cm1 corresponds to the simulation peak at 275 cm1, with the smaller experimental peak at 270 cm1 appearing in the simulation as a shoulder at 260 cm1.
The double peaked structure observed in ex- periment at 284 cm1, which has signiÔ¨Åcant activity in a magnetic Ô¨Åeld, corresponds to the simulated peaks at 302, 313, and 316 cm1.
The following experimental triplet, consisting of a large peak at 300 cm1 followed by two small peaks at 320 and 340 cm1, is present in the simu- lation, although at the resolution of the graph in Fig. 1 the two peaks at 326 and 329 cm1 overlap, and the third peak appears at 343 cm1.
The small peak at 360 cm1 and intense peak at 375 cm1 are reproduced in the simulation with opposite relative intensities (or interchanged fre- quency order) in the double peaked structure at 360 to 368 cm1.
The intense peak at 410 cm1 bracketed by two smaller peaks at 395 and 415 cm1 appears in the simulation between 412 and 439 cm1.
The two small peaks in the calculated IR spectrum at 385 and 395 cm1 are not clearly visible in the experimental data, although they could correspond to the small feature at 382 to 390 cm1 in the gap between the prominent double peak and triple peak structures.
In the highest frequency range measured by experiment agreement with the simulation is still good, although the relative intensities of the peaks are less accurately reproduced.
The two faint experimental peaks at 465 and 495 cm1 probably correspond to the two relatively prominent peaks at 460 and 476 cm1.
The Ô¨Åve peaks between 510 and 570 cm1 correspond to the Ô¨Åve peaks between 500 and 545 cm1.
Although the in- tensities relative to the previous two peaks are lower in the simulation, opposite to experiment, the relative intensities within the Ô¨Åve-peak structure are good.
In both the experi- ment and simulation, the second and Ô¨Åfth peaks are most prominent.
The intense double peak at 605 to 610 cm1 clearly corresponds to the simulated double peak at 564 to 571 cm1.
There is no comparably intense feature in the simulation that corresponds to the highest frequency ex- perimental peak at 640 cm1, although several less intense peaks are present in the correct frequency range.
The decomposition into contributions from different structural elements in the Mn12 molecule shows some general trends as a function of frequency, but no sharp variation from mode to mode.
Below 500 cm1, the main contributions are from the Mn and formic acid.

Above 500 cm1, the Mn contribution grows relative to the formic acid contribution, with particularly large Mn and anionic oxygen weights in the 564 to 571 cm1 double peak.
We now discuss our calculations on the vibrational con- tributions to fourth-order anisotropy.
The coupled spin/ vibron Hamiltonian is given by H  X ab abSaSb  X j 1 2  P2 j  !
2 jQ2 j  2 !2 j X ab dab dQj QjSaSb: (2) The above expression may be analyzed either classically or quantum mechanically to determine how vibrational cou- pling affects the magnetization barrier.
As demonstrated below, the magnetization barrier is enhanced by approxi- mately 5.6 K classically and 6.2 K quantum mechanically since the quantum mechanical expectation value of S2 is 10% larger than the classical value for S  10.
However, to address questions related to isotopic effects and changes in tunnel barriers, a quantum mechanical analysis is required.
The simplest level of approximation is to take a product wave function of the form ji  jjjijSMi, with jji a harmonic oscillator wave function and jSMi a spin wave function, and determine the diagonal energy of this state.
The resulting energy EM  hSMjHjSMi is given by EM  X ab abUabM  X j 1 2 !
j  X abcd abcdUabMUcdM; (3) with aba0b0  P j 1=2!2 j dab=dQj da0b0=dQj: and Uab  hSMjSaSbjSMi.
The fourth-order barrier en- hancement may then be estimated by evaluating the second line of Eq. (3) for the M  	10 and M  0 states and taking the difference.
This energy difference is 6.2 K. To compare directly to the experimental parametrization of Barra et al. which uses fourth-order Stevens operators, it is instructive to expand both our calculated and their Ô¨Åtted fourth-order expression in terms of orthogonal cubic poly- nomials of degree 4.
Because of the S4 symmetry of the molecule, it is generally possible to write the fourth-order energy according to E4  A4o  fA14 S2S2z  S2=3  A24 3S4  35S4z  30S2S2z  B14 S4x  S4y  6S2xS2y  B24 SxSyS2x  S2yg=104.
In Table I, we com- pare the values of the expansion coefÔ¨Åcients for each representation.
The O2 4 Stevens operator can be expanded into Legendre polynomials of degree 2 and 4, respectively.
An interesting feature, present in both the experimental and theoretical expansions, is that, for the most part, the fourth-order terms exhibit nearly the same angular varia- tion as the second-order Hamiltonian.
For example, the entirely diagonal fourth-order S2S2z  S2=3 term accounts for almost all of the barrier enhancement.
This feature is very important from the standpoint of sharp tunneling transitions.
It ensures that magnetic-Ô¨Åeld induced alignment condition aligns multiple pairs of states simultaneously which opens multiple tunneling paths.
The coefÔ¨Åcient A24 changes the diagonal energies by A24  M4=104 and is partially responsible for a broadening of the magnetic-Ô¨Åeld alignment condition but does not cause any tunnel splittings at zero Ô¨Åeld.
The B14 coefÔ¨Åcient corre- sponds to the B4 4 Stephenson coefÔ¨Åcient, and leads to observable tunnel splittings in the M  	2 manifold and smaller tunnel splittings in the M  	4 manifold.
Our isotopically pure calculations show tunnel splittings of the M  	2, M  	4, and M	  6 manifolds of ap- proximately 102, 7  106, and 6  1010 K, respec- tively, but do not split the odd M states since coupling is between M and M 	 4.
By randomly changing a single atomic mass by 1 amu, we Ô¨Ånd that the odd-M states are split with a tunnel splitting of the M  	1 states on the order of 104 K.
The isotopic effects experimentally ob- served by Wernsdorfer et al. [17] in Fe8 may be partially due to the mass effects identiÔ¨Åed here.
In Fig. 2, we show the barrier as a function of the number of vibrational modes that are included.
When none of the vibrational modes are included, the barrier reproduces the earlier calculation of Ref. [11].
As expected qualitatively, most (85%) of the fourth-order barrier is associated with the frequencies in the 100‚Äì500 cm1 range that correlates with Mn vibrations.
The upper panel of the Ô¨Ågure shows that there are 5‚Äì10 modes which account for about 80%‚Äì90% of the fourth-order anisotropy barrier.
For ex- ample, single modes at 189, 270, 280, 465, and 1496 cm1 contribute 0.8, 1.6, 0.8, 0.25, and 0.45 K, respectively, to the fourth-order barrier.
These modes and all other modes that contribute visible spikes in Fig. 2 share one simple trait.
They are optically silent to IR absorption and trans- mission but show strong Raman intensity.
The calculated Raman intensities for these modes are shown in Table II.
Recently, Sushkov et al. [9] have performed experiments on Mn12-Ac and have shown that the IR transmittances at 284, 306, and 409 cm1 exhibit strong dependencies when magnetic Ô¨Åelds are applied to the crystal and that the dependence is particularly strong for the mode at 284 cm1.
This suggests that vibrations in this energy range are associated with the spin carrying Mn ions as conÔ¨Årmed from the projected density of states in Fig. 1.
While the Raman modes are responsible for the formation of the fourth-order barrier, the strong contributions due to TABLE I. Calculated Raman intensities for modes that are primarily responsible for the formation of the vibrational fourth-order magnetic anisotropy.

While the calculated fourth-order contribution to the tunneling barrier of 6.2 K is in close agreement with the experimental values of 7‚Äì10 K, it is indeed a small number so it is appropriate to consider other vibrational effects that might be non-negligible.
To determine possible effects of methyl termination of the carboxyl groups, we have changed the mass of the H on the formate groups from 1 to 15 (the mass of a CH3).
This further increases the fourth-order anisotropy from 6.2 to 7.3 K and leads to even better agreement with experiment.
There could also be terms due to d2=dQ2.
However, such interactions effectively change the vibrational spring con- stant and scale as 2=m!c4 rather than 4=m!2c8, where  is the total magnetic moment.
Further, in contrast to terms discussed above, these contributions add as am- plitudes and could partially cancel one another.
The spring- constant terms directly modify the second-order  matrix allowing for isotopic induced symmetry breaking.
While potentially unimportant from the standpoint of barrier for- mation, this effect leads to a type of locally varying sec- ond-order transverse anisotropy required to explain experiments (see Ref. [18]).
We are in the process of studying this and other possibilities.
In summary, we have performed accurate DFT-based calculations on the Mn12-Ac molecule to determine whether vibron-spin coupling could be responsible for part of the fourth-order anisotropy Hamiltonian.
Our re- sults suggest that vibron-spin coupling accounts for most of the effect, and that it is signiÔ¨Åcantly larger and a differ- ent sign than the O1=c8 terms that arise from an exact diagonalization treatment of spin-orbit coupling.
