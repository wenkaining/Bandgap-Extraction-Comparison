Enhanced Dispersion Interaction in Conﬁned Geometry Michal Marcovitch1 and Haim Diamant2, * 1School of Physics & Astronomy, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel 2School of Chemistry, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel (Received 17 August 2005; published 23 November 2005) The dispersion interaction between two pointlike particles conﬁned in a dielectric slab between two plates of another dielectric medium is studied within a continuum (Lifshitz) theory.
The retarded (Casimir-Polder) interaction at large interparticle distances is found to be strongly enhanced as the mismatch between the dielectric permittivities of the two media is increased.
The large-distance interaction is multiplied due to conﬁnement by a factor of 335=2  133=2=46 at zero temperature, and by 52  2=6 at ﬁnite temperature,   in0=out0 being the ratio between the static dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer media.
This conﬁnement-induced ampliﬁcation of the dispersion interaction can reach several orders of magnitude.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.223203 PACS numbers: 34.20.b, 03.65.Sq, 82.70.y The dispersion interaction acts between any two polar- izable objects, thus being one of the most ubiquitous interactions in Nature [1–3].
It plays a central role in numerous phenomena in chemical physics and materials science, including gas-liquid condensation, capillarity [4], intersurface interactions [5], and colloid stability [6].
The dispersion interaction is a ﬂuctuation-induced cou- pling between two polarizable particles mediated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In an unconﬁned system at zero temperature there is a single length scale with which the interparticle distance R is to be compared, i.e., the charac- teristic wavelength 0 of photon absorption by the parti- cles, typically in the ultraviolet to visible range.
London’s calculation [7], valid in the nonretarded limit R  0, yields the potential UR  3@= R1 0 d2iR6, where ! is the frequency-dependent polarizability of the particles.
Casimir and Polder [8] recast the problem in quantum-electrodynamic terms, whereby the interaction arises from the effect of the particles on the zero-point modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
For R  0 the Casimir-Polder result coincides with London’s, yet in the retarded limit, R 	 0, the interaction decays as R7, UR  23=4@c20R7 [9].
As a result, the dispersion interaction between two particles in the retarded regime (typically R > 0:1 m) is extremely weak and has not been directly observed.
(Particle-surface and surface– surface interactions across such micron-scale distances are much stronger and were successfully measured in the 1990s [10,11].) In this Letter we demonstrate that this weak particle-particle interaction can be dramatically am- pliﬁed in conﬁned geometries.
At a ﬁnite temperature T another length scale appears, i.e., the thermal wavelength T  @c=T ’ 7:6 m at room temperature.
(The Boltzmann constant is set hereafter to unity.) As was shown in Ref.
[12], retardation and ﬁnite- temperature effects are intertwined.
For R 	 T, the Helmholtz free energy of interaction returns to a R6 dependence, FR  3T20R6.
The theory of dispersion interactions was extended by Lifshitz et al. to the case where the interacting objects as well as the intervening space are continuous media [13,14].
In this continuum theory the material response to electro- magnetic ﬁelds is assumed to be fully captured by the complex, frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity ! [15].
The current work is based on such a continuum approach.
Despite the strong underlying assumption (after all, the media themselves consist of discrete polarizable particles), the Lifshitz theory has been widely used and experimentally corroborated [5].
It is expected to yield valid results so long as the distance between the two particles is much larger than the intermolecular distances in the materials.
In various circumstances particles are spatially conﬁned, e.g., in porous media, micro-cavities, biological constric- tions or nanoﬂuidic devices.
Such conﬁnement introduces a new length scale, the separation h between the bounding surfaces.
The dispersion interaction between a single par- ticle and conﬁning surfaces has been extensively studied in the context of cavity QED [10,16].
The effect of conﬁne- ment on the interaction between two particles, however, has been only partially addressed.
Conﬁnement by two metallic plates (i.e., the limit where the permittivity of the outer medium out !
1) was found to drastically affect the interaction between two pointlike particles in vacuum at zero [17] and nonzero [18] temperatures.
The non- retarded interaction between particles conﬁned by two dielectric plates at T  0 was addressed within a single- image approximation in Ref. [19].
We follow the lines of Mahanty, Ninham, Bostro¨m, and Longdell [17,18] and extend their theory to the general and more practical case of arbitrary permittivities of both inner and outer media, discovering a dramatic enhancement for experimentally relevant values of in and out.
The system under consideration is schematically shown in Fig. 1.

The slab is bounded by two semi- inﬁnite media of dielectric permittivity out!.
We use cylindrical coordinates, r  ; ’; z, the ^z axis taken per- pendicular to the bounding surfaces.
For simplicity we specialize to the symmetric case where the particles lie on the slab midplane, z  h=2, connected by the vector R  R; 0; 0.
All materials are assumed nonmagnetic.
We employ the semiclassical scheme introduced by Mahanty and Ninham, which accurately reproduces the London and Casimir-Polder results [20].
In this theory the energy of interaction at T  0 is given by [1] T  0: UR  8@ Z 1 0 d4 c4 2i   TrGR;iGR;i; (1) and the Helmholtz free energy at ﬁnite T by T > 0: FR  42T X 1 n0 0 2in4n=c4   TrGR; inGR; in; n  2c=Tn; (2) the prime indicating that the n  0 term is multiplied by 1=2.

(The position r0 is taken inside the slab.) The boundary condi- tions in the current case are continuity across the bounding surfaces of the tangential components of both the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
This imposes continuity on ^z   G and ^z   r   G across z  0 and z  h.
Thus, this scheme reduces the problem to ﬁnding the Green tensor Gr; r0; !

Given in;outi and i , one can substitute Eq. (4) in Eq. (1) or (2) and calculate numerically the interaction potential.
It is instructive, however, to ﬁrst analyze the interaction in several asymptotic limits.
We begin with the small- distance limit, recovering the known results for unconﬁned particles.
For R  h the expressions for gi are expanded to leading order in large v, whereupon the integration in Eq. (4) can be carried out analytically.
Substituting the result in Eq. (1), we get UR  @=R6 R1 0 de2p3  6p  5p2  2p3  p42i=2 ini.
In the nonretarded limit, R  0, we take the leading order in small p, for which the London result is recovered, T  0; R  h; 0: UR   3@ R6 Z 1 0 d 2i 2 ini ; (5) with the appropriate correction due to the fact that the particles are not in vacuum (in  1).
In the retarded limit, R 	 0, the integral over  is dominated by small (static) . An asymptotic analysis then recovers the Casimir- Polder result with the correction for in  1, T  0; 0  R  h: UR   23@c20 45=2 in 0R7 : (6) Similarly, substitution of the asymptotic Green tensor for R  h in Eq.

Subsequently taking the limit R  T, we expand to leading order in small pn [23] and recover the known result for the nonretarded interaction at ﬁnite tem- perature [24], T > 0; R  h; T: FR   6T R6 X 1 n0 0 2in 2 inin : (7) In the other limit, R 	 T, the sum is dominated by the n  0 term, leading to the known retarded interaction at εin εout εout x y z R h z=0 z=h FIG. 1.

In the limit R 	 h the expressions for gi in Eq. (4) are expanded to lead- ing order in small v, and the integration in Eq. (4) is performed analytically.
The result is substituted in Eq. (1) to yield UR  @=2R6 R1 0 de2 p5  4  10  24 p  7  34 p2  2  24 p3  1  4 p42i=2outi, where p  1=2p.
In the nonretarded regime, this expression is expanded to leading order in small p, leading to T  0; h  R  0: UR   3@ R6 Z 1 0 d 2i 2 ini 52i  2i 6 : (9) Equation (9) gives the nonretarded interaction under con- ﬁnement.
It reduces to the London result, Eq. (5), for   in=out  1.
This result has a rather restricted validity as it requires that h be much smaller than 0.
(A detailed discussion of the conﬁned nonretarded interaction will be given elsewhere.) In the retarded regime the integral is dominated by small , leading to T  0; R 	 h; 0: UR   23@c20 45=2 in 0R7 335=2  133=2 46 ; (10) where we have written 0   for brevity.
This retarded interaction under conﬁnement converges to the Casimir- Polder expression, Eq. (6), for   1.
At ﬁnite temperature we substitute the asymptotic Green tensor for R	h in Eq.

For R  T we take the leading order in small pn [23] and get T > 0; h  R  T: FR   6T R6 X 1 n0 0 2in 2 inin 52in  2in 6 : (11) This is the extension of Eq. (7) to the conﬁned case.
For R 	 T, the n  0 term dominates the sum, yielding T > 0; R 	 h; T: FR   3T20 2 in0R6 52  2 6 ; (12) which extends Eq. (8) to the conﬁned geometry.
Equations (10) and (12) are our central results.
They account for the large-distance, retarded dispersion interac- tion between the conﬁned particles at zero and ﬁnite tem- perature, respectively. Comparing with Eqs.
(6) and (8), we see that the conﬁnement is manifest as a factor dependent on the ratio 0 between the static dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer media.
This factor can be as small as 0.78 [Eq. (10)] or 0.75 [Eq. (12)], but increases indeﬁnitely with the permittivity mismatch.
The divergence of the interaction energy for  ! 0 or 1 is obviously unphysical.
Although Eqs. (10) and (12) are asymptotically correct for any ﬁnite mismatch, as  becomes increasingly large or small one must go to ever larger interparticle distances for these asymptotes to hold.
Ultimately, in the limits  ! 0; 1 their range of validity disappears, and the large- distance interaction obeys a different power law [17,18].
(Detailed analysis of this behavior will be given else- where.) The main point, however, is that the ampliﬁcation factor can be very large for reasonable values of . For example, for particles embedded in a polar liquid in0  80 which is conﬁned by glass plates out0  4 at room temperature, one gets an ampliﬁcation factor of about 300.

PRL 95, 223203 (2005) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 25 NOVEMBER 2005 223203-3If the outer medium is a gas (a freestanding ﬁlm, out  1), the factor increases to about 5000 [25].
Finally, we present results from numerical integration of Eqs.
(2) and (4) for two examples of practical interest.
This requires expressions for i of the various media, for which we use the Ninham-Parsegian representation [2,26], an empirical ﬁt based on electromagnetic absorption spec- tra of the materials.
In the ﬁrst example two polystyrene particles are conﬁned in a slab of water between two glass plates at room temperature.
The function ini for water is found in Refs.
[2,6] and that for silica glass, outi, in Ref. [26].
For i we took the excess Clausius-Mossotti polarizability [5] of a polystyrene sphere, i=V  3ini=4PSi  ini=PSi  2ini, V being the particle volume and PSi the permittivity of polystyrene, found in Refs. [2,6].
The resulting potentials for two interplate separations, h  1 and 0:1 m, are shown in Fig. 2(a) along with the unconﬁned potential.
The interaction per volume squared has been scaled by T=R6.
The curves, therefore, represent the effective Hamaker coefﬁcient (divided by 2, in units of T) as a function of interparticle distance.
The unconﬁned potential clearly exhibits the crossover from the nonretarded R6 regime at small R to the retarded R7 dependence at intermediate distances, and then back to the R6 decay due to temperature.
The conﬁned interaction deviates from the unconﬁned one at distances R * h.
The ampliﬁcation increases moderately with distance until saturating to the asymptotic value given in Eq. (12).
In the second example two polystyrene particles are conﬁned in a hydrocarbon slab of thickness h  3 nm, which is embedded in water.
This may mimic small hydrophobic inclusions in a bio- logical membrane.
For the oily environment we used the permittivity ini of pentane [1].
As is seen in Fig. 2(b) , the ampliﬁcation becomes signiﬁcant only at R * 10h.
This is because for smaller distances retardation has not yet set in.
(Note where the unconﬁned potential departs from its nonretarded R6 behavior.) The conﬁnement-induced enhancement of the retarded dispersion interaction can be viewed as a consequence of multiple-reﬂection wave guiding of the electromagnetic radiation between the boundaries.
Despite the demon- strated strong effect the interaction remains weak.
In the example presented in Fig. 2(a), for instance, the interaction free energy for h  1 m and R  10 m is about 3  106 T=m6.
Nevertheless, to achieve the same energy without conﬁnement one would have to set the interparticle distance at about 2 m.
Thus, besides the fundamental signiﬁcance of the strong conﬁnement effect reported here for particle interactions in conﬁned systems, it may become useful also in extending the range of observation of the Casimir-Polder interaction.
