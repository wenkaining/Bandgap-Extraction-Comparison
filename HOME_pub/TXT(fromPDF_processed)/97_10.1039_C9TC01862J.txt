C, 2019, 7, 8868 Tungsten boride: a 2D multiple Dirac semimetal for the hydrogen evolution reaction† Aizhu Wang,ab Lei Shen,c Mingwen Zhao, *d Junru Wang,d Weijia Zhou,a Weifeng Li,d Yuanping Feng*e and Hong Liu *af Development of a non-noble-metal hydrogen-producing catalyst plays a central role in clean energy conversion, enabling a number of sustainable processes for future technologies.
Here we propose a two-dimensional (2D) tungsten boride (WB4) lattice, with the Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (DGH) tending to the ideal value (0 eV) at the 3% strained state, leading to better hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.
Based on first-principles calculations, we present a systematic theoretical study for the WB4 lattice with special emphasis on the configuration design and electronic structure, and find that the WB4 lattice has multiple Dirac cones around the Fermi level with considerable Fermi velocities to transfer electrons in all directions throughout its structure.
Importantly, together with the d-orbital of W, the p-orbitals of borophene subunits in the WB4 lattice can modulate the d band centre to achieve good HER performance.
Our research provides a guiding principle for designing and regulating 2D catalysts from the emerging field of noble-metal-free lattices.
Introduction When powered by renewable energy sources, the generation of hydrogen from the electrolysis of water is a means to produce a high-energy density, mobile energy carrier without any asso- ciated carbon dioxide emissions.1 At low temperatures, this process can take place in a series of electrochemical devices, ranging from high-current-density polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers2–4 to low-current-density, solar-driven photoelectro- chemical cells.5–7 For all these water-splitting applications, the choice of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst employed at the cathode can have a profound influence on the cost, lifetime, and efficiency of the device.
Pt is a very active and commonly used HER catalyst, but its high price and limited world-wide supply1,8 make its use a barrier to mass production of H2 by water electrolysis.
The eﬀective approach to overcome the challenges associated with Pt HER catalysts is to increase the surface to bulk atomic ratio of Pt, thus allowing for a lower metal loading to be used without compromising electrolysis eﬃciency.1 In the past few years, both experimental and theoretical researchers have made their great eﬀorts to solve the challenges.
The common method is chemical treatment,9–11 including surface modification, alloying, heteroatom doping and so on.
Another approach that works is completely replacing Pt with alternative non-Pt catalysts, such as transition metal alloys, sulfides, carbides, nitrides, borides, etc.12–16 Hence, a prerequisite is gaining detailed knowledge of structure– activity correlations for electrode materials to better understand the activity trends and then rapidly discovering new advanced catalysts for the HER.
Positioned next to carbon in the periodic table, boron is a special element in the sense that it not only can bond both covalently and ionically,17 but it is capable of forming a great variety of pure allotropes ranging from zero-dimensional clusters to three-dimensional (3D) bulk materials,18–21 suggesting that boron shares many of the characteristics of carbon.
Advanced research demonstrated that several 3D boride compounds consisting of two-dimensional (2D) boron layers as subunits (known as borophene subunits) have recently emerged as a potential new frontier for searching better HER catalysts,22–24 which can be contributed as the strongly bound effect of a Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, Shandong, China b Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117579, Singapore c Department of Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Science Programme, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117575, Singapore d School of Physics and State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, Shandong, China.

C, 2019, 7, 8868--8873 | 8869 borophene subunits within the solid in contrast to the weakly bound graphene layer in graphite.
However, the research on the HER activity of 2D borophene subunits is still blank.
Here, a 2D tungsten boride (WB4) lattice (Fig. 1A) is proposed, in which a triangular tungsten layer is sandwiched by two borophene subunits, forming a ‘‘sandwich’’ layer.
Based on first-principles calculations, we find that the WB4 lattice has superior stability and multiple Dirac cones due to the d–p–p and d–p–s conjugations.
Moreover, our study demonstrates a different principle to spur HER activity that can go beyond local site optimization by manipulating the d band centre within a certain strain range, as evidenced by an optimum Gibbs free energy of the 2  2 WB4 nanosheet.
Our results, here, not only provide a versatile platform for hosting multiple Dirac semi- metal states with a ‘‘sandwich’’ configuration, but also offer a guiding principle for discovering the relationship between the intrinsic properties of the active centre and the catalytic activity of the metal layer from the emerging field of noble-metal-free lattices.
Computational details DFT calculations First-principles calculations within density-functional theory (DFT) were implemented by the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).37 A generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)38 was adopted to describe the electron–electron interactions.
The energy cut-off employed for plane-wave expansion of electron wavefunctions was set to 520 eV and the electron–ion interactions were treated using projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials.39 The DFT-D3 method was applied to include the long-range van der Waals interaction for the adsorption on the WB4 lattice.40 The system was modelled by unit cells repeated periodically on the x–y plane, while a vacuum region of 15 Å was applied along the z-direction to avoid mirror interaction between neighbouring images.
The Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was sampled on a grid of 13  13  1 k-points for the unit cell and 7  7  1 k-points for the 2  2  1 supercell.
Structure optimization was carried out using a conjugate gradient (CG) method until the remaining force on each atom is less than 0.05 eV Å1.
Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption The Gibbs free-energy of hydrogen adsorption, DGH, is a good descriptor for hydrogen evolution,41,42 which is defined as DGH = DEH  EZPE  TDSH, where DEH is the hydrogen adsorp- tion energy, which can be obtained as follows: DEH = EH  E(n1)H*  1/2EH2, where * denotes the catalyst activity site.
EnH*, E(n1)H* and EH2 are the total energies of the catalyst with n adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the total energies of the catalyst with n  1 adsorbed hydrogen atoms and gas H2, respectively.
DEZPE and DSH stand for the change in the zero-point energy (ZPE) and the change in the entropy of hydrogen between the adsorbed state and the gas state.
We found that DEZPE does not vary significantly with respect to hydrogen coverage because of the smaller entropy of hydrogen in the adsorbed state.
TDSH E TS0 H = 0.202 eV at T = 298 K, where S0 H is the entropy in the gas phase.43 The standard hydrogen electrode (USHE) was theoreti- cally defined in solution [pH = 0, p(H2) = 1 bar].
The optimal HER activity can be achieved as DGH goes to zero, where both hydrogen adsorption and the subsequent desorption can be facilitated.
Results and discussion Characterization of WB4 Experimentally, bulk WB2 is found in the hexagonal phase within the P6/mmm space group with an intercalated geometric configuration comprising W frameworks and borophene subunits.25 Only on this alone, our proposed structure – WB4 monolayer – can be naturally produced through exfoliation of the WB2 nanosheet (ESI†).
Fig. 1A presents the top view and side view, respectively, of the optimized configuration, where the triangle lattice W atoms are located above the centre of the honeycomb graphene-like boron lattice from the top view, forming a ‘‘sandwich’’.
The electron localization function (ELF) indicates that B atoms are chemically bonded to the triangle W lattice, while the covalent like B–B bonds are preserved, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The lengths are 1.706 Å, 2.371 Å and 2.955 Å for covalent B–B, ionic W–B and metallic W–W bonds, respectively, and the optimized lattice constant is found to be 2.955 Å, matching with the trigonal W lattice in WB2.
Then, the thermodynamic stability of the WB4 framework is confirmed by the phonon spectrum and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
Clearly, the phonon spectrum of the WB4 lattice is free from imaginary frequencies (Fig. S4, ESI†), while, the geometry of WB4 remains unchanged but with small fluctua- tions of the total energy with the passage of time (Fig. S5, ESI†), implying the thermodynamic stability of the WB4 lattice.
By comparing the cleavage energy, it is verified that the WB4 monolayer is robustly stable compared to WB2 in the process of synthesizing a 2D tungsten boride lattice.
So, it can be regarded as a WB4 multilayer, and a single layer of large dimensions is plausible in the near future thanks to the well-developed preparative technique (ESI†).
To oﬀer more reference informa- tion for the experimental observation, the simulated STM image of the WB4 monolayer is also displayed (Fig. 1B).

C, 2019, 7, 8868--8873 This journal is ©The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 Excellent electronic transport properties The electronic properties including the band structure and the corresponding projected electronic density of states are presented (Fig. 2A).
Based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, two Dirac cones exist close to the Fermi level (Ef), exhibiting the characteristic of semimetal.
By plotting the orbital-resolved band structures as well as the charge density distributions, it is clearly seen that the Dirac bands are composed mainly of the p states of B atoms and the d states of W atoms.
More specifically, bands I and II are derived from the coupling of the px/y/z orbitals of B atoms and the dz2/dx2y2/ dxy orbitals of W atoms, meanwhile, bands III and IV are mainly derived from the coupling of the pz orbital of B and W atoms, together with the dxz/dyz orbitals of W atoms (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).
Here, the hybrid functional (HSE06) was adopted to double check the above electronic band structure, and the results suggest that the semimetal feature and orbital origin of the WB4 lattice remain intact (Fig. S9, ESI†).
Apart from the equilibrium state, we also investigate the robustness of semimetal states at finite biaxial strain.
Fig. 3 shows that the semimetal feature is robust against stretching along the xy-direction, but gradually converts into metal states with abundant states around Ef under the compressional conditions, suggesting a diﬀerent strain response of WB4.
The Fermi velocity (nf) of the WB4 lattice was calculated by fitting these Dirac bands and extreme values at the equilibrium state, 0.72  106 m s1 for band I, 0.54  106 m s1 for band II and 0.61  106 m s1 for bands III and IV (ESI†), were achieved.
The multiple Dirac states (diﬀerent locations, origins and aniso- tropies/isotropies), together with their considerable Fermi velocities, should enable the WB4 monolayer to transfer electrons in all directions throughout its structure, suggesting its excellent electronic transport property.
Hydrogen evolution reaction activity The metallic property is favourable for the electron injection from a cathode to the catalyst surface, where intermediate protons induced by water dissociation in alkaline solutions are reduced and adsorbed on the catalyst-covered cathode.26 Hence, we study electrocatalysis applications of the Dirac semi- metal lattice with high carrier mobility.
Both experimentally and theoretically, the Volmer step is recognized as the rate- determining step for the HER,27–29 so, the Gibbs free energy of atomic hydrogen adsorption (DGH) is the key operator to describe the HER activity.30 Here, we adopt a (2  2) supercell of the WB4 lattice to study its catalytic activity and find that the bridge site is the most stable adsorption site (Fig. 4A and ESI†).
Therefore, we will only focus on the bridge site hereafter.
In order to elucidate the adsorption mechanism, we further analyse the charge transfer between with and without the atomic hydrogen adsorption, which is defined as DQ = Q(sub + H)  Q(sub)  Q(H), where Q(sub + H), Q(sub) and Q(H) are the charge densities of the corresponding WB4 systems with adsorbed hydrogen, the corresponding clean WB4 systems and a single hydrogen atom, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 4B, charges can transfer between B and H atoms as well as the nearest W atoms, providing a possible platform for catalytic reactions.
Formally, the charges are mainly con- tributed by the p-orbitals of B and the d-orbitals of W (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†).
Quantitatively, the Bader charge analysis reveals that the hydrogen atom has a net gain of 2.32e from the surrounding B and W atoms, exhibiting an excellent potential performance for HER activity.
Based on the PBE functional, we obtained the Gibbs free energy DGH = 0.06 eV for the above WB4 nanosheet, indicating that the surface bridge site is catalytically active for the HER.

C, 2019, 7, 8868--8873 | 8871 we investigated the biaxial strain eﬀect on the HER catalytic activity of the WB4 lattice, and the related Gibbs free energies are calculated (Fig. 4C).
Interestingly, the DGH of the WB4 nanosheet responds diﬀerently to the above-mentioned Dirac semimetal states.
For example, stretching makes the WB4 nanosheet approach the ideal catalytic state (DGH B 0.00 eV) firstly, and then with further increased stretching it moves far away from the state, suggesting that the WB4 nanosheet has a good HER performance within a certain tensile strain range.
Controlled d band mechanisms To analyse the origin of the catalytic activity evolution, we examined how the d-band centre can be modulated with the change of strain in the WB4 nanosheet.
Considering the orbital hybridization between W atoms (the distance ranges from 2.955 Å to 3.132 Å), the d-orbitals of four W atoms are plotted (Fig. 5) and their d-band centres are marked with black arrows.
According to the d-band theory, a lower d-band centre results in weaker bonding between the catalyst and the adsorbate.33 Taking the zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy into account, the relative catalytic activity of WB4 (DGH) has a similar evolutionary relationship with the d band centre (Fig. 4C, 5 and Fig. S15, ESI†).
The results can be attributed to the existence of the B intermediate, modulating the combination of W with H to enable a mild catalytic reaction to proceed by changing the coupling interactions between the d-orbitals of W and the p-orbitals of B.
The coupling interactions make the d-orbital centre of W shift to a moderate value, resulting in a better catalytic activity.
Interestingly, the desorption barrier of the 5% strained state (with DGH B 0.06 eV) equals the adsorption barrier of the 0% equilibrium state (with DGH B 0.06 eV), so we can get the maximum adsorption and desorption by mani- pulating a small external stress to get an ideal catalytic state.
Additionally, it was demonstrated that both the DGH and d-band centre have the same evolution trends in the presence of spin orbital coupling eﬀects (Fig. S16, ESI†), suggesting the nature of the HER performance of the WB4 lattice.
Except the modulated d-band centre, the excellent conduc- tivity and Fermi velocity, induced by the eﬀect of Dirac cones with d–p–p and d–p–s conjugations, can also guarantee fast electron transfer in the electrochemical reactions.
Therefore, our results not only provide a guiding principle for the discovery of Dirac semimetal catalysts with noble-metal-free ‘‘sandwich’’ configurations, but also offer a universal description of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of the active Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the (2  2) WB4 2D supercell with adsorbed hydrogen (A) and the corresponding charge density diﬀerence before and after the adsorption (B).

C, 2019, 7, 8868--8873 This journal is ©The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 centre and the catalytic activity of the metal layer, which are in line with a new research frontier in single-atom electrocatalysts.34–36 High thermal stability The surface Pourbaix diagrams of the equilibrium (0%) and strained (3%) states are constructed by plotting the thermo- dynamically most stable surface state at relevant USHE and pH values (Fig. 4D).
In an acidic solution (pH = 0), negative USHE values (reducing environment) as low as 2.14 and 2.43 V are required to protect the equilibrium state and strained state, respectively, from oxidation by H2O. A more negative potential is necessary to protect the bare WB4 lattice at high pH values with a slope of 0.059 V pH1.
When the potential is above the cathodic protection potential of 2D WB4, water starts to oxidize and WB4 is covered with one hydroxyl (OH*).
As the potential increases, the hydroxyls on WB4 will be oxidized, and the most stable O*-terminated WB4 will be formed.
The lowest USHE values for 2D WB4 with one O* termination are 0.03 V (0%) and 0.03 V (3%) in an acidic solution.
Therefore, under standard conditions, the strained state prefers to be terminated by O*, exhibiting a better HER performance fitting with the DGH descriptor (ESI†).
Hydrogen coverage eﬀect in WB4 Finally, we explore the hydrogen coverage eﬀect on the HER catalytic performance of the 0% and 3% states.
We define the coverage of hydrogen as a fraction of a monolayer with respect to the number of available B–B bridge sites (12 sites) in the basal plane.
Here, we consider one (s = 1/12), two (s = 1/6), three (s = 1/4) and four (s = 1/3) atomic hydrogen adsorption in the 2  2 WB4 supercell and calculate Gibbs free energies as summarized in Fig. 6 and the ESI.† As a benchmark, we firstly calculate the HER performance of Pt with DGH = 0.05 eV, fitting well with other previous works.30,34 Interestingly, the variation of the Gibbs free energy is obvious with the increase of H coverage, indicating that DGH is sensitive to the hydrogen coverage.
Typically, the 3% strained state at s = 1/3 has a free energy of 0.02 eV, whose catalytic performance even exceeds that of Pt.
Hence, considering the Pt-like activity for the HER of WB4, a series of 2D noble-metal-free ‘‘sandwich’’ lattices should be promising materials to replace Pt or Pt-based compounds in other electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications.
Conclusions Here, we propose a 2D tungsten boride (WB4) lattice, with a Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (DGH) tending to the ideal value (0 eV) at the 3% strained state, leading to better hydrogen evolution reaction activity.
Based on first-principles calculations, it was demonstrated that the WB4 lattice has superior stability and multiple Dirac cones due to the d–p–p and d–p–s conjugations.
Interestingly, coupling with the d-orbital of W, the p-orbitals of borophene subunits in the WB4 lattice can modulate the d band center to achieve good HER performance.
Our results, here, not only provide a versa- tile platform for hosting multiple Dirac semimetal states with a ‘‘sandwich’’ configuration, but also offer a guiding principle for discovering the relationship between the intrinsic properties of the active center and the catalytic activity of the metal layer from the emerging field of 2D noble-metal-free lattices.
