In helimagnets,  nonreciprocal electronic  transport offers a potential  readout method by mirroring the  material’s chirality.
Yet, the  underlying mechanisms remain  poorly understood, limiting the  application of helimagnetic chiral  information.
The current  understanding primarily relies on  phenomenological observations  of real-space dynamics, rather  than on a microscopic  examination in momentum  space.

Edited by Risto Nieminen, Aalto-­Yliopisto Teknillisen Fysiikan Laitos, Espoo, Finland; received March 20, 2024; accepted November 22, 2024 Chiral magnetic textures give rise to unconventional magnetotransport phenomena  such as the topological Hall effect and nonreciprocal electronic transport.
While the  correspondence between topology or symmetry of chiral magnetic structures and such  transport phenomena has been well established, a microscopic understanding based  on the spin-­dependent band structure in momentum space remains elusive.
Here, we  demonstrate how a chiral magnetic superstructure introduces an asymmetry in the  electronic band structure and triggers a nonreciprocal electronic transport in a cen- trosymmetric helimagnet α-­EuP3.
The magnetic structure of α-­EuP3 is highly tunable  by a magnetic field and closely coupled to its semimetallic electronic band structure,  enabling a systematic study across chiral and achiral magnetic phases on the correspond- ence between nonreciprocal transport and electronic band asymmetry.
Our findings  reveal how a microscopic change in the magnetic configuration of charge carriers can  lead to nonreciprocal electronic transport, paving the way for designing chiral magnets  with desirable properties.
nonreciprocal electronic transport | chirality | helimagnetic semimetal  Chirality is the breaking of mirror symmetry.
The concept of chirality is applicable in a  wide range of scientific fields, from high-energy physics to biology ( 1 ).
In condensed  matter, the chirality caused by the crystal structure is primarily studied.
However, there  is a distinct class of materials where the magnetic structure induces chirality.
In particular,  in helimagnets, the spiral arrangement of magnetic moments breaks the mirror symmetry,  thus inducing chirality.
The topological magnetic textures denoted as a skyrmion lattice  can be viewed as the superposition of several helimagnetic structures ( 2 ,  3 ).
The chiral  magnetic textures give rise to a number of unique physical properties, among which the  nonreciprocal electronic transport has been extensively studied recently ( 4 – 7 ).
Nonreciprocal electronic transport is the rectification of electric conduction in systems  without spatial-inversion (  ) and time-reversal (  ) symmetries ( 8 – 12 ).
When the crystal  structure breaks   , the mechanism is well understood.
For example, in BiTeBr ( 13 ), the  polar crystal structure induces a Rashba-type spin splitting in the electronic structure.
Then, an applied magnetic field gives rise to the asymmetry of the electronic band struc- ture, causing a rectification effect.
On the other hand, in chiral magnetic textures with a  centrosymmetric crystal structure, it is the arrangement of the spins that breaks   in a  distinct manner such that it gives rise to a finite chirality in the system.
The nonreciprocal  electronic transport has been studied in chiral magnets such as MnP ( 6 ) and MnAu2 ( 7 ),  showing a sizeable effect of magnetic chirality on electronic transport.
However, the  mechanism of nonreciprocal electronic transport in helimagnetic systems remains unclear.
In this article, through a combination of nonreciprocal electronic transport experiments  and first-principles band structure calculations, we demonstrate that the nonreciprocal  electronic transport is induced by a magnetically driven asymmetry of the band structure  in a helimagnetic semimetal α-EuP3 .
α-EuP3 has a centrosymmetric crystal structure with  a monoclinic space-group type C 2/m ( 14 ), characterized by a single mirror plane perpen- dicular to the twofold rotational b﻿-axis ( Fig. 1A ).
The 4f﻿-states of the divalent Eu ions are  highly localized and relatively close in energy to the Fermi level and thus behave as local  magnetic moments interacting through carrier-mediated Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya– Yosida coupling ( 15 – 17 ).
Results and Discussion  It has been recently noted that α-EuP3 exhibits a characteristic interplay between mag- netism and electronic structure, leading to unusual magnetotransport responses such as  OPEN ACCESS SEE CORRECTION FOR THIS ARTICLE Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by Shanghai University on June 17, 2025 from IP address 58.199.187.142.2 of 7   https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2405839122 pnas.org a large anomalous Hall effect caused by a topological transition  ( 14 ).
However, the discussion was mainly for the paramagnetic  regime, and therefore the transport involving the magnetically  ordered regime remains unraveled.
Fig. 1B shows the field- temperature phase diagram of α-EuP3 based on resistivity and  magnetization measurements under magnetic fields applied along  the a﻿-axis.
Two low-temperature magnetic phases are observed,  consistent with the previously reported results of isostructural  P-rich Eu(As1- x P x )3 ( 18 – 21 ).
The system undergoes two incom- mensurate phases upon decreasing temperature: a sinusoidal phase  and, at lower temperatures, a helimagnetic phase.
Both phases  have almost the same magnetic propagation vector [ q ~ (−0.726,  0, 0.255) and (−0.726, 0, 0.222), respectively ( 18 – 20 )], nearly  parallel to the crystalline a﻿-axis.
Under an applied magnetic field  along the a﻿-axis, approximately perpendicular to the helical plane,  the magnetic structure first forms a conical structure.
As the field  increases, it is naturally expected that at some point, the cone  collapses into a fan structure ( 22 ), where the moment along the  ﻿c﻿-axis vanishes and leaves an oscillating component along the  magnetically easy b﻿-axis.
Eventually, this evolution ends in a field- forced ferromagnetic (FM) configuration.
The above process is schematically shown in  Fig. 1C .
As can be  seen, the breaking of    in the helimagnetic state forbids any energy  degeneracy between an electronic state E (kq , sq ) and either E (- kq , sq )  or E (kq , - sq ), where kq and sq are the momentum and spin compo- nents, respectively, along the helimagnetic propagation vector  q .
This results in a symmetric spin-polarized band structure.
Applying  a magnetic field along  q , where the conical magnetic structure  forms, introduces an asymmetry in the band structure, which, as  we will show later, leads to nonreciprocal behavior in electronic  transport.
When the magnetic field is strong enough, the band  structure becomes symmetric again with a fan-shaped achiral mag- netic structure.
Eventually, all spins are fully aligned with the  magnetic field, leading to an FM structure.
The variation of the  band structure in the course of magnetic phase transitions was  partly discussed in a simplified theoretical model ( 23 ) but has  never been observed in a real material.
The resistivity in helimagnets along the propagation vector can  be described up to the nonlinear regime as ﻿ 휌(j ) = 휌1 + 휌2j + ⋅⋅⋅,    where ρ﻿1 (=ρ﻿1 ω ) and ρ﻿2 reflect the ordinary resistivity and nonlin- ear resistivity, respectively, and j  is the electric current density.
The  second term can be sensitively measured as a second-harmonic  voltage under an ac electric current j = j﻿0 sinωt ( 8 ); ﻿ E = 휌1휔j0sin휔t + 휌2휔j0(1 −cos2휔t) + ⋅⋅⋅.    ρ﻿2 ω = ρ﻿2﻿j﻿0 /2 is composed of field-symmetric and field-asymmetric  components as ρ﻿2 ω﻿ = ρ﻿2 ω sym + ρ﻿2 ω asym , where ρ﻿2 ω sym (+H ) =  ﻿ρ﻿2 ω sym (−H ) and ρ﻿2 ω asym (+H ) = −ρ﻿2 ω asym (−H ).
ρ﻿2 ω asym is caused by  the nonreciprocal electronic transport while ρ﻿2 ω sym may be induced  by some extrinsic effect such as the effect of electrode contact.
Because  휌2휔∝j0 , a large electric current density j﻿0 is preferred for  the measurement of nonlinear electronic transport.
To realize a  large current density, the α-EuP3 single crystal sample was micro- fabricated into a device with a cross-sectional area of ~8 × 4 μm2  ( Fig. 2A ), using the focused ion-beam (FIB) technique ( 24 ).

Although the band structures are symmetric under sinusoidal, paramagnetic, helical, fan, and ferromagnetic structures, the  conical magnetic structure induced by a moderate magnetic field applied along the q-­vector gives rise to an asymmetrical deformation of the band structure  along the k-­path in the q-­vector direction.

The  overall resistivity behavior is consistent with previously reported  bulk sample results ( 14 ), assuring the device quality.
Fig. 2C exemplifies the second-harmonic resistivity ρ﻿2 ω as a  function of the magnetic field at 4.2 K, measured by a lock-in  amplifier.
ρ﻿2 ω shows an evident field-asymmetric behavior with  minimal hysteresis.
ρ﻿2 ω seems mostly composed of an intrinsic  nonreciprocal electronic resistivity ρ﻿2 ω asym , which is induced by  the finite chirality of the system arising from helimagnetic order.
Fig. 2D shows the field asymmetric component ρ﻿2 ω asym =  [ρ﻿2 ω﻿H -increase (+H ) − ρ﻿2 ω﻿H -decrease (−H )] /2, where the subscripts of  ﻿ρ﻿2 ω﻿H -increase and ρ﻿2 ω﻿H -decrease describe the sweeping direction of the  magnetic field.
Since ρ﻿2 ω was measured for a full loop of 0 T →  +1 T → −1 T → 0 T, ρ﻿2 ω asym is presented in quadrants of both  positive and negative magnetic fields.
Note that the sign and mag- nitude of ρ﻿2 ω are not reproduced in repeated measurements, pre- sented in detail in Supporting Information (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ).
This is because there are two energetically degenerate chiral states  in the centrosymmetric crystal α-EuP3 , and the chiral domain  population differs in each measurement.
Recent studies on cen- trosymmetric helimagnetic metals with Mn magnetic moments  have reported that the helimagnetic chirality can be controlled by  traversing the achiral–chiral transition while simultaneously apply- ing a magnetic field and a high-density dc electric current ( 6 ,  7 ,   25 ,  26 ).
The sign of the controlled chirality depends on whether  the magnetic field and dc current are parallel or antiparallel.
Following these reports, we have attempted to control the chirality  by a similar procedure with the magnetic field H﻿p and dc current  ﻿J﻿p before the measurement of ρ﻿2 ω shown in  Fig. 2C and SI Appendix,  Fig. S2 (for the details of the procedure, see SI Appendix ).
As shown  in SI Appendix, Fig. S2A , the sign of ρ﻿2 ω asym  does not depend on H﻿p  and J﻿p but seems random, indicating the control procedure was not  effective in α-EuP3 (for the reasons of ineffectiveness, see  ﻿SI Appendix, Section 1 ).
Nevertheless, the magnetic field evolution  was generally reproducible.
Notably, ρ﻿2 ω asym shows a complex mag- netic field dependence.
As the magnetic field is increased from 0  T, it first shows a broad peak and then steeply changes accompa- nying a sign change followed by a sharp peak.
Fig. 2D shows the  magnetic field dependence of ρ﻿2 ω asym measured at temperatures  of 4.2 K, 6.1 K, 8.0 K, and 10.0 K. The ρ﻿2 ω measurements were  done several times at each temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ),  and the presented data in  Fig. 2D correspond to the maximum  response obtained.
ρ﻿2 ω asym distinctly demonstrates nonreciprocity  only within the chiral magnetic phase (4.2 K and 6.1 K) and  vanishes in the achiral phases (8.0 K and 10.0 K).
These results  cannot be explained by the extrinsic heating mechanism as  detailed in SI Appendix and clearly show the correspondence  between ρ﻿2 ω asym and the magnetic symmetry.
Let us now examine the detailed magnetic field dependence of the ρ﻿2 ω asym signal across chiral–achiral transitions.
Fig. 3D displays  the nonreciprocal electronic response at 4.2 K while sweeping the  magnetic field from +4 T to −4 T without any chirality-control  procedure, with the data antisymmetrized as ρ﻿2 ω asym = [ρ﻿2 ω (+H )  − ρ﻿2 ω (−H )]/2.
This antisymmetrization is valid when the magnetic  hysteresis is negligible, as confirmed in  Fig. 2C .
The obtained data  are scaled to that shown in  Fig. 2D by multiplying a constant.
The  ﻿ρ﻿2 ω asym signal shows a sharp peak around B﻿1 ~ 0.7 T. In the high  field region, ρ﻿2 ω asym gradually decreases and vanishes at around B﻿2  ~ 2.5 T.
For comparison, we plot the magnetic field dependences  of magnetization M  and its field derivative, longitudinal resistivity  ﻿ρxx , and Hall resistivity ρyx in  Fig. 3 A –C .

The disap- pearance of ρ﻿2 ω asym at B﻿2 is again in excellent agreement with the  magnetic symmetry (marked as red stars in  Fig. 1B ).
In addition,  a slight anomaly is discerned in the derivative of magnetization  around B﻿1 .
In contrast, this B﻿1 anomaly is conspicuously observed  in the longitudinal and Hall resistivities, both showing a peak.
In  a previous paper, Mayo et al.
( 14 ) reported a Fermi surface recon- struction induced by the FM polarization of Eu 4f moments,  occurring at an approximate threshold magnetization of M ~ 1.8  μB /Eu.
The observed anomalies at B﻿1 indeed correspond to a sim- ilar magnetization as the reported threshold.
The fact that the  anomaly is notable in the transport properties and less visible in  magnetization suggests a strong role of the Fermi surface in the  observed nonreciprocity (for further notes on magnetotransport  results, see SI Appendix ).
To understand how the experimentally observed nonreciprocity  in α-EuP3 arises from microscopic changes in its band structure,  we have conducted first-principles band calculations for the rele- vant magnetic structures: helical, conical, fan, and FM (Materials  and Methods and SI Appendix ).
We construct each magnetic phase  by appropriately constraining the directions of Eu magnetic  moments in a sufficiently large supercell as shown in SI Appendix,  Fig. S8 .
It is to be noted that the reported helical magnetic order  is incommensurate and slightly tilted from the crystalline a﻿-axis  [ q ~ (−0.726, 0, 0.222)].
We have instead considered a commen- surate helimagnetic model with  q = (−0.75, 0, 0) and a helical  plane perpendicular to  q for the sake of simplicity.
The validity of  this simplification is examined in SI Appendix, section 7 .
To model  the intermediate phases induced by the magnetic field, the Eu  magnetic moments were gradually tilted along the a﻿-axis through  a systematic linear interpolation between the helimagnetic and  ferromagnetic phases.
This resulted in a net magnetization along  the a﻿-axis with a conical magnetic configuration, which we used  to find its corresponding magnetic field in our experimental setup  ﻿μ﻿0 H // a in this phase.
The fan structure was separately constructed  by setting the c *-axis ( c *// a ×  b ) components of the magnetic  moments to zero and collapsing the conical structure.
Fig. 4A  displays the band structure calculated for each of these magnetic  phases along the −Y – Γ – +Y direction, corresponding to the  ﻿a*﻿-axis direction ( a *// b ×  c ).
As can be seen, in the helical phase  (M = 0 μB /Eu), the spin degeneracy is lifted due to a spin-dependent  shift along the ±Y direction rather than a Zeeman-like splitting,  characteristic to a   -broken system.
It should be noted that the  momentum-dependent spin splitting seen here differs from the  Rashba-type, in which the shifted direction in momentum space  is perpendicular to the spin direction.
Rather, the spin direction  of the split bands is parallel to the direction of momentum shift,  similar to the case of chiral materials such as Te ( 27 ).
Nonetheless,  the overall band structure is symmetric along −Y – Γ – +Y.   Upon introducing a conical deformation in the magnetic struc- ture, achieved through applying a relatively weak magnetization  along the a﻿-axis, a notable transformation unfolds within the band  structure, evident as a pronounced asymmetry in the band disper- sions along −Y – Γ – +Y. This asymmetry implies a discernible  distinction in the charge current induced by an electric field +E  as compared to that of −E .
Consequently, the system is anticipated  to manifest a finite nonreciprocal electronic resistivity within the  conical phase.
Remarkably, as the magnetic phase transitions away  from the conical phase into the achiral fan magnetic or ferromag- netic phase, a restoration of symmetry becomes apparent in the  band structure along −Y – Γ – +Y, as illustrated in  Fig. 1C .
This  intriguing finding provides compelling evidence as to why non- reciprocal electronic transport is exclusively observable in the  conical magnetic structure and explains how this distinct asym- metry in the band dispersions is responsible for it.
To further discuss the effect of field variation in the conical  magnetic state, we turn our attention to the conical angle  A B C D Fig. 3.   Magnetic field dependence of transport and magnetic properties  across chiral-­achiral phase transitions.

Fig. 4B schematically illustrates  the conical angle-dependent evolution of the relevant Fermi pock- ets.
Here, we show the pockets corresponding to the energy level  indicated by the dashed lines in  Fig. 4A .
As can be seen, they  appear as two symmetric pockets in the helimagnetic state, as  expected.
However, upon tilting the magnetic moments along the  ﻿a﻿-axis and, hence, increasing the conical angle, an asymmetric  deformation of the energy pockets emerges.
In the FM state, the  energy pockets regain symmetry.
Another notable feature seen in the experiment is a sharp sign  change followed by a negative peak in ρ﻿2ω﻿asym under increasing  magnetization ( Fig. 4C  ).
As a measure of band asymmetry, we  plot the residual density of states, defined as the difference between  the total density of states for +ka *  and that for −ka * , in the conical  phase as a function of conical magnetization in  Fig. 4D .

Despite its apparent simplicity, it is remarkable that our  theoretical model not only captures but also qualitatively agrees  with the experiment, further providing compelling evidence that  the nonreciprocal electronic transport is induced by the asymme- try in the momentum-space electronic bands.
In summary, we have investigated nonreciprocal electronic trans- port in a magnetic semimetal α-EuP3 .
The material facilitates suc- cessive tunability of the magnetic structure from helimagnetic to  induced ferromagnetic structures via conical and fan structures in  response to a magnetic field, presenting a rich array of transport  responses coupled with the magnetic phases.
The nonreciprocal  electronic transport was found to arise as the chiral magnetic struc- ture imposes an asymmetric deformation in the electronic band  structure and vanishes as the magnetic structure is tuned into an  achiral phase, restoring symmetry in momentum space.
Moreover,  a singular sign change of nonreciprocal electronic transport in the  middle of the conical phase is observed, seemingly caused by the  reversal of band asymmetry in the course of the dramatic exchange  splitting inherent in this material.
These results unravel that the  nonreciprocal electronic transport in helimagnets originates from  the band asymmetry caused by the magnetic chirality.
The modeling  of nonlinear transport on the Boltzmann level for this material  remains an open challenge at present.
The relation between the band asymmetry and the nonreciprocal  electronic transport was first suggested for a semiconductor with a  noncentrosymmetric crystal structure ( 13 ).
The present work shows  that this relation is valid also for helimagnets.
Since long-period chiral  magnetic structures can be viewed as the superposition of helimag- netic and sinusoidal structures ( 28 ), the present result can be gener- alized to other chiral spin structures such as the skyrmion lattice.
Moreover, similar relations have recently been studied in symmetry-  broken correlated states.
The asymmetry originating from the  momentum-dependent orbital moment is proposed to induce the  nonreciprocal transport in the charge-ordered Kagome metal CsV3 Sb5  ( 29 ).
One of the major mechanisms of the superconducting diode  effect is finite-momentum Cooper pairing, induced by band   asymmetry originating from the lack of time-reversal and inversion  symmetries ( 30 – 35 ).
The relation between momentum-space asym- metry and nonreciprocal transport appears to be quite generic.
Materials and Methods Single Crystal Growth and Crystal Identification.
Single crystals of α-­EuP3  were grown by the high-­pressure synthesis method (14).
The crystal was identified  as α-­EuP3 by powder and single-­crystal X-­ray diffraction techniques.
FIB-­Microfabrication of Transport Devices.
The Hall bar device was fabricated  using the FIB technique (24) in the following steps: first, a small piece of single-­ crystal α-­EuP3 with an approximate size of 100 × 50 × 8 μm3 was placed on an  oxidized single-­crystal silicon wafer.
Next, 20 nm of Pt was deposited by RF mag- netron sputtering, followed by 200 nm of Au deposited by electron beam evapora- tion, both covering the entire sample.
The sample was then fixed to the substrate  by FIB-­assisted Pt deposition, ensuring electrical contact between the sample and  substrate electrodes, and then was patterned into a Hall bar by FIB.
Finally, the  Pt/Au layer on the central top surface of the Hall bar channel was etched away by  FIB.
Additional information can be found in SI Appendix, section 12.
Magnetotransport Measurements.
For the bulk measurements, electrode  contacts were made by depositing 200 nm of Au on the sample and connecting  Au wires using silver paste (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Both bulk and FIB samples were  subjected to transport measurements in a superconducting magnet.
The ac resis- tivities were measured using the four-­wire configuration and the standard lock-­in  technique, applying an ac electric current with a frequency of 11.15 Hz.
The ac  electric current density applied for the second-­harmonic resistivity measurement  in the FIB sample was set to an amplitude of 1 × 107 A/m2.
Band Structure Calculations.
The electronic structure calculations were per- formed within density functional theory (DFT) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof  (PBE) exchange-­correlation functional (36) as implemented in the VASP program  (37, 38).
To properly treat the strong on-­site Coulomb interaction of Eu-­4f states,  an effective Hubbard-­like potential term Ueff was added to the PBE functional.
The  value of Ueff was fixed at 6 eV for Eu-­4f orbitals (39) and zero for all other orbitals.
Relativistic effects including spin–orbit coupling were fully taken into account.
The cutoff energy for plane waves forming the basis set was set to 400 eV. The  lattice parameters and atomic positions were taken from experiment (14).
The  corresponding Brillouin zone for the 4 × 1 × 1 supercell (main text) and 4 × 1  × 2 supercell (SI Appendix) calculations were sampled using a 2 × 8 × 8 and 2  × 8 × 4 k-­mesh, respectively.
The calculation for each magnetic structure was  carried out by imposing the corresponding magnetic moment configurations on  the Eu site.
The density-­of-­states calculations were performed using a 64-­band  effective Hamiltonian, downfolded from the DFT calculations using maximally  localized Wannier functions (40).
The sampling of the corresponding Brillouin  zone was done using a 240 × 240 × 240 k-­mesh.
