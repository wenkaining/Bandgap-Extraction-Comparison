Spin-valve effect by ballistic transport in ferromagnetic metal (MnAs)/semiconductor (GaAs) hybrid heterostructures Pham Nam Hai,1 Yusuke Sakata,1 Masafumi Yokoyama,1 Shinobu Ohya,1,2 and Masaaki Tanaka1,2 1Department of Electronic Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan 2Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi-shi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan Received 7 January 2008; revised manuscript received 18 April 2008; published 26 June 2008 We demonstrate the spin-valve effect by ballistic transport in fully epitaxial MnAs ferromagnetic metal/ GaAs semiconductor/GaAs:MnAs granular hybrid heterostructures.
The GaAs:MnAs material contains ferro- magnetic NiAs-type hexagonal MnAs nanoparticles in a GaAs matrix, and acts as a spin injector and a spin detector.
Although the barrier height of the GaAs/MnAs interface was found to be very small, relatively large magnetoresistance was observed.
This result shows that by using ballistic transport, we can realize a large spin-valve effect without inserting a high tunnel barrier at the ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor interface.

Using the spin degrees of freedom in three-terminal active semiconductor devices is then a natural extension of spintronics research.
Recently, devices such as spin ﬁeld-effect transistor spin FET Ref.
1 and spin metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor spin MOS- FET Ref.
2 have been proposed as new building blocks for future electronics.
Those devices are expected to have the advantages of nonvolatility and low power consumption of magnetic devices, as well as high-speed operation of semi- conductor devices.3 The most basic operations of these semiconductor-based spintronic devices require electrical in- jection of spin-polarized carriers into a semiconductor SC channel and detection of them by ferromagnetic metal FM electrodes, i.e., the spin-valve effect in FM/SC/FM hybrid heterostructure.
Unlike the metal-based spin valves, how- ever, this hybrid spin-valve structure has a serious problem.
Due to the large conductivity mismatch between ferromag- netic metals and semiconductors in the diffusive transport regime, the imbalance of injected majority and minority spins in the semiconductor channel becomes extremely small.
This “conductivity mismatch” problem has been con- ﬁrmed in recent theoretical and experimental studies.4–12 It has been well established that, to overcome this problem, a tunnel or Schottky barrier has to be inserted at the interface of FM and SC.4,5,13,14 However, such a high resistance inter- face is not preferred because it drastically decreases the cur- rent driving capability when used in active transport devices.
In this paper, we show that by using ballistic transport of spin-polarized electrons in a SC channel, we can obtain a large spin-valve effect without inserting a high resistance interface.
In the case of ballistic transport, the high resistivity of semiconductors is no longer relevant; thus, the conductiv- ity mismatch problem may not occur.
Consequently, a ballis- tic semiconductor spintronic device can utilize both the non- volatility of magnetic devices and the high-speed operation of semiconductor devices.15,16 Indeed, the spin FET and the spin MOSFET are assumed to work under the ballistic trans- port regime.
Nevertheless, realization of ballistic transport in FM/SC/FM spin-valve structures has been very challenging for the following reasons: First, the length of the semicon- ductor channel must be shorter than the mean-free path of electrons, that is, it must be a scale of several tens of nanom- eters or shorter.
Second, the interface between FM and SC must be very smooth and free of disorders to avoid loss of spin selectivity,15,17 thus any surface treatment techniques such as etching or sputtering should be excluded.
Third, be- cause the bias voltage Vhalf at which the spin-valve ratio is reduced by half is typically several hundreds of mV, the Schottky barrier at the FM/SC interface must be low enough to allow ballistic tunneling of electrons from the electrodes to the conduction band of the semiconductor spacer with a small bias voltage. II.
EPITAXIAL GROWTH AND SPIN-VALVE DEVICE STRUCTURE In order to satisfy the requirements mentioned above, we have performed epitaxial growth of FM/SC/FM spin-valve structures using molecular-beam epitaxy MBE.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 214435 2008 1098-0121/2008/7721/2144356 ©2008 The American Physical Society 214435-1shows our spin-valve device structure grown on a p+ GaAs001 substrate.
The structure consists of an undoped GaAs semiconductor layer with the thickness of tGaAs =10–30 nm sandwiched by two ferromagnetic MnAs elec- trodes.
The bottom electrode is a granular thin ﬁlm, in which ferromagnetic MnAs nanoparticles with size of 5 nm in di- ameter are embedded in a thin-ﬁlm GaAs matrix referred to as GaAs: MnAs. The top electrode is a 20-nm-thick type-A MnAs thin ﬁlm.18 The crystal structure of both the MnAs nanoparticles and the MnAs thin ﬁlm is hexagonal of NiAs- type.
The growth procedure was as follows: First, we grew a 20-nm-thick Be-doped GaAs buffer layer on a p+ GaAs001 substrate at 580 °C.
After cooling the substrate temperature to 300 °C, we grew a 5-nm-thick Ga0.957Mn0.043As thin ﬁlm.
Then, the structure was annealed at 580 °C for 20 min in the MBE growth chamber, during which phase separation oc- curred in the GaMnAs layer and MnAs nanoparticles were formed in the GaAs matrix.19–21 After that, the substrate tem- perature was cooled to 300 °C again and a GaAs spacer layer with thickness of 10–30 nm was grown.
Finally, a 20- nm-thick type-A MnAs thin ﬁlm was grown at 260 °C as a top electrode.
By growing the GaAs spacer layer at 300 °C, we can suppress diffusion of residual Mn atoms from the GaAs:MnAs electrode to the GaAs spacer while maintaining high crystal quality of GaAs for ballistic transport.
The GaAs layers grown at 300 °C are semi-insulating and show an electron mobility of 1000 cm2/Vs at room temperature, corresponding to the mean-free path of 10 nm.
The mean- free path is probably even longer at low temperature.
The ballistic transport of electrons through the 300 °C-grown GaAs layer at low temperature was conﬁrmed by observing the negative differential resistance NDR in AlAs/GaAs/AlAs resonant tunneling diodes RTDs with a 300 °C-grown GaAs quantum well.
We observed clear NDR and the resonant peak current density is in good agreement with data reported in literature.22 This result, together with the high electron mobility of GaAs, suggests that the NDR observed in our RTDs is due to the ballistic transport of electron through the GaAs quantum well.
The current ﬂow in our spin-valve structures consists of two components.
The ﬁrst component is a hole current ﬂow- ing directly from the top MnAs ﬁlm to the p+ GaAs substrate through the area without MnAs nanoparticles.
This compo- nent is not desirable since it does not contribute to the spin- valve effect.
Note that the area without MnAs nanoparticles occupies 96% of the GaAs:MnAs layer while that with MnAs nanoparticles occupies only 4%.
To obtain a large spin-valve effect, it is very important to suppress this “intrin- sic leak current.” Fortunately, the hole tunneling current ﬂowing directly from the top ﬁlm to the p+ GaAs buffer layer is very small at low bias voltage since the tunnel barrier for holes is quite high for MnAs.
The second component is an electron current ﬂowing from the p+ GaAs buffer through the bottom MnAs nanoparticles to the top MnAs ﬁlm.
This com- ponent dominates the whole current at low bias voltage, even though the MnAs nanoclusters occupy only 4% in cross- sectional area of GaAs:MnAs layer, because the barrier height of the GaAs:MnAs/GaAs/MnAs junction is quite low for electrons, as discussed below.
The electrons must at ﬁrst tunnel from the valence band of p+GaAs to the MnAs nano- particles; thus, there is a parasitic resistance of the MnAs nanoparticles/p+GaAs Schottky interface.
Since the p+GaAs buffer layers are strongly degenerated by Be and residual Mn acceptors, the parasitic resistance is small.
Indeed, the cur- rent I-voltage V characteristics are very symmetric, re- vealing that this parasitic resistance can be neglected.
It is worth noting that the overgrowth of high-quality semiconductor layer on top of a FM layer is very difﬁcult.
In the MnAs ﬁlm/III–V/MnAs ﬁlm magnetic tunneling junc- tions MTJs reported before, due to the poor crystal quality of the semiconductor layer, the tunneling process through the defect band appeared.23 Furthermore, the high density of the defects at the III–V/MnAs interface in those junctions pinned the Fermi level of the electrode at the midgap of the semiconductor; thus, the barrier height is as high as 0.7 eV. Consequently, any attempt to inject spin-polarized carriers to the conduction band will result in no spin-valve signal since the bias voltage needed for the Fowler-Nordheim FN tun- neling of electrons to the conduction band of the semicon- ductor layer becomes much larger than Vhalf.
The unique GaAs:MnAs electrode in our spin-valve structure, however, allows the overgrowth of a high-quality and atomically con- trolled GaAs semiconductor spacer layer.19–21 Furthermore, the MnAs nanoparticles have been shown to work well as a spin injector and a spin detector.21 The barrier height be- tween MnAs and GaAs in our spin-valve structure was found to be very small, allowing direct spin injection to the con- duction band of GaAs by FN tunneling with a relatively small bias voltage.
Our spin-valve structures emulate the source/channel/drain junctions of ballistic spin MOSFET at the “ON” state when the barrier height at the FM source/ semiconductor interface is lowered by an applied gate volt- age. III.
VERTICAL TRANSPORT AND SPIN-VALVE EFFECT A. Tunneling transport After the growth, we fabricated circular mesa diode struc- tures with 200 m in diameter by standard photolithography and chemical etching.
We spin coated an insulating negative resist on the sample, opened a contact hole with 180 m in diameter on the top of the mesa, and fabricated a metal elec- trode by evaporating Au on this surface.
In the following measurement, the bias polarity is deﬁned by the voltage of the top MnAs electrode with respect to the substrate.
Figure 2 shows the tGaAs dependence of the resistances R of four spin-valve devices with tGaAs=10, 15, 20, and 30 nm plotted in two ways; a logR-tGaAs with a bias voltage V of 1 mV, and b R-tGaAs2 with V=50 mV. Assuming direct tunnel- ing of electrons through the GaAs rectangular-type tunnel barrier as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a, we deduce that the effective barrier height 1 meV from the gradient of the logR-tGaAs line by using the WKB approximation.
This re- sult is surprising but seems consistent with the fact that the Fermi level of MnAs lies above the minimum of the X valley of AlAs semiconductor in MnAs/GaAs/AlAs/GaAs:MnAs magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs.21 The conductance across the MnAs/GaAs interface in our samples is comparable or even better than that of the Co/GaAs interface with  HAI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 214435 2008 214435-210 meV reported recently.24 With this very small barrier height, electrons can easily transport from the MnAs elec- trodes to the conduction band of GaAs by the FN tunneling when the bias is higher V=50 mV, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2b. The FN-tunneling current is given by I = e3mMnAsV2S 8mGaAshtGaAs 2 exp−8tGaAs2mGaAs 3heV 3/2 1 where V is the bias voltage, S is the effective area through which the current ﬂows, h is the Planck constant, e is the electronic charge, and mMnAs and mGaAs are the effective electron masses of MnAs and GaAs, respectively.
When eV, the tGaAs dependence of the exponential part of Eq. 1 is weak; thus, R=V/I is proportional to tGaAs2.25 Figure 2b shows that R measured at 50 mV is proportional to tGaAs2, revealing the FN-tunneling nature of electron trans- port.
In Fig. 2c, we show the conductance G=I/V—bias voltage V characteristics of the four spin-valve devices with different tGaAs.
The G-V characteristics are clearly dif- ferent from that of a typical Simmons-type tunnel junction with a rectangular barrier Ref.
26 but can be explained by the FN-tunneling based Eq. 1.
In the low bias area area I where the exponential part of Eq. 1 is smaller than unity, G nonlinearly increases with the increasing bias V.
In the inter- mediate bias area area II, G linearly increases with the increasing V since the exponential part of Eq. 1 has reached unity.
Finally, in the high bias area area III, G increases nonlinearly again with the increasing V except for the sample with tGaAs=30 nm.
The nonlinear increase of G in area III can be attributed to the parallel conduction through the GaAs matrix where MnAs nanoparticles do not exist.
This parallel conduction results in the quick decrease of spin-valve ratios at large bias voltages, as discussed later.
The G-V character- istics at negative bias voltages are similar to those at the positive bias voltages.
B. Magnetotransport Figures 3a–3d show the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of the resistance of the spin-valve devices measured at 7 K with a bias of 50 mV. The black and red curves are major and minor loops, respectively.
The major loops are superposition of the magnetoresistance MR components of the ferromag- netic electrodes gradual change and the spin-valve effect abrupt jumps of resistance. The hysteresis observed in the minor loops indicates that the resistance jumps correspond to the magnetization reversal of the GaAs:MnAs nanoparticles.
As a reference sample, we fabricated a tunnel junction without MnAs nanoparticles, whose structure is from the substrate to the top surface p+ GaAs/GaAs 20 nm /MnAs 20 nm.
In tunneling magnetotransport measurements, we ob- served only 0.6% gradual change of resistance with no jump.
This means that the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance TAMR effect of the MnAs electrode is negligible.

SPIN-VALVE EFFECT BY BALLISTIC TRANSPORT IN… PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 214435 2008 214435-3Spin Valve ratio = 8P2rMnAs rGaAs lGaAs sf tGaAs 2 , 2 where P is the spin polarization of MnAs, rMnAs and rGaAs are the products of the resistivity by the spin-diffusion length for MnAs and GaAs, respectively, and lGaAs sf is the spin-diffusion length of GaAs.

27, rMnAs/rGaAs=10−6, lGaAs sf =10 m, and tGaAs=10 nm, we get a spin-valve ratio of 10−6.
This spin-valve ratio expected for purely diffusive transport is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of our experimental results.
Consequently, the appearance of the spin-valve effect of several percent in our structures, even when there is no high tunnel or Schottky barriers at the in- terfaces, indicates that the electron transport is ballistic. The FIG.

Figure 3e shows the tGaAs dependence of Hex.
The Hex value decreases with increasing tGaAs, quantitatively in agreement with the exchange cou- pling in a ballistic tunneling junction predicted by Slonczewski.28 Recently, ferromagnetic coupling between MnAs and ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs via a GaAs semiconductor layer has been reported to drop off rap- idly for tGaAs6 nm.29 However, Hex in our junctions dropped more slowly and existed up to tGaAs=30 nm, result- ing from the small tGaAs dependence of R.28 Performing best ﬁtting with Hex1/tGaAs n , we found that n=1.
Figure 4a shows the bias dependence of the spin-valve ratio deﬁned as Rmax−RH=0/RH=0 measured at 7 K, where Rmax is the maximum resistance and RH=0 is the resistance at zero magnetic ﬁeld.
The sample with tGaAs=10 nm has the largest spin-valve ratio with a maximum of 8.2% when the bias voltage V120 mV. However, when V120 mV, its spin-valve ratio decreases rapidly and becomes smaller than that of the sample with tGaAs=30 nm.
On the other hand, the spin-valve ratio of the sample with tGaAs=30 nm decreases most slowly with increasing the bias voltage up to 400 mV.
This is because when V120 mV, the parallel conduction becomes largest for the sample with tGaAs=10 nm but neg- ligible for the sample with tGaAs=30 nm, as suggested by Fig. 2c. The spin-valve ratios of the two other samples with tGaAs=15 and 20 nm decrease in the same manner as that of the sample with tGaAs=10 nm due to the parallel conduction at high bias voltages.
Despite the parallel conduction, the spin-valve effect was observed up to 300 mV for all samples in our experiments.
Figure 4b shows the temperature dependence of the spin-valve ratios measured with a bias voltage of 50 mV. The spin-valve ratios of all the samples decreased with increasing temperature and disappeared at about 90 K. In contrast, the MR component the gradual change of resistance with the magnetic-ﬁeld sweep was observed up to room temperature.
The absence of the spin-valve effect at T90 K is not due to the temperature dependence of the magnetization of the MnAs ﬁlm or the GaAs:MnAs electrode for the following reasons.
First of all, the Curie temperature of MnAs ﬁlm is higher than room temperature.
The blocking temperature of MnAs nanoparticles as high as 230 K for MnAs nanopar- ticles with 5 nm in diameter and 300 K for MnAs nanopar- ticles with 10 nm in diameter.30 Moreover, the tunneling magnetoresistance effect of MnAs/GaAs/AlAs/GaAs:MnAs MTJs with MnAs nanoparticles having a diameter of 5 nm was observed up to room temperature.31 In case of spin-valve structures, the spin-polarized electrons must transport over the conduction band of the semiconductor.
Thus, the spin- valve structure generally suffers from the conductivity mis- match problem, which does not appear in the MTJ structure.
The decrease of the spin-valve effect with increasing tem- perature and its disappearance at T90 K in Fig. 4b are thus a natural manifestation of the electron-transport mecha- nism in the GaAs channel.
When the electron transport changes from ballistic regime to purely diffusive regime with increasing temperature, the conductivity mismatch occurs and destroys the spin-valve effect.
IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have observed relatively large spin- valve effect by ballistic transport in MnAs/GaAs/ GaAs:MnAs hybrid heterostructure even when the barrier height of MnAs/GaAs interface is very small.
Our experi- mental results have shown that by choosing a proper combi- nation of FM/SC materials and using ballistic transport, we can obtain a large spin-valve effect without using a high resistance interface.
Noting that the silicon technology node has reached 45 nm, it is expected that the ballistic transport of electrons in semiconductors can be utilized to make active semiconductor-based spin devices for future electronics.
