Different response of the crystal structure to isoelectronic doping in BaFe2(As1‚àíxPx)2 and (Ba1‚àíxSrx)Fe2As2 Marianne Rotter, Christine Hieke, and Dirk Johrendt* Department Chemie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Butenandtstrasse 5-13 (Haus D), 81377 M√ºnchen, Germany Received 9 May 2010; revised manuscript received 15 June 2010; published 12 July 2010 Superconductivity up to 30 K in charge neutrally doped BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 has been ascribed to chemical pressure caused by the shrinking unit cell.
But the latter induces no superconductivity in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 in spite of the same volume range.
We show that the spin-density-wave SDW state of BaFe2As2 becomes suppressed in BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 by a subtle reorganization of the crystal structure, where arsenic and phos- phorus are located at different coordinates zAs and zP. High-resolution x-ray diffraction experiments with BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe-P bonds, but a contraction of the Fe-As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2.
Since the Fe-As bond length is a gauge for the magnetic moment, our results show why the SDW is suppressed by P doping, but not by Sr doping.
Only the Fe-P interaction increases the width of the iron 3d bands, which destabilizes the magnetic SDW ground state.
The simultaneous contraction of the Fe-As bonds is rather a consequence of the vanishing magnetism.
Ordered structure models of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 obtained by density-functional theory calculations agree perfectly with the single-crystal x-ray structure determinations.
The contraction of the Fe-As bonds saturates at doping levels above x0.3, which corrects the unreasonable linear decrease in the so-called pnictide height.

INTRODUCTION Superconductivity emerges in iron arsenides after the an- tiferromagnetic order of their parent compounds becomes suppressed.1‚Äì4 This proximity of magnetic and superconduct- ing order parameters is widely accepted as one key argument for an unconventional pairing mechanism, which is mediated by spin Ô¨Çuctuations5 as it was considered for the cuprates.6,7 But in strong contrast to the copper oxides, superconductiv- ity in iron arsenides can be induced without changing the carrier concentration, either by applying external pressure8,9 or by charge neutral doping.
Especially the isoelectronic substitution of arsenic by phosphorus in REOFeAs1‚àíxPx with RE=La and Ce,10‚Äì12 and AFe2As1‚àíxPx2 with A=Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu Refs.
13‚Äì15 has turned out to be an ideal tuning parameter to explore the borderline of magnetic ordering and supercon- ductivity.
In iron arsenides, the already present Fermi surface can be Ô¨Ånely tuned by the crystal structure parameters in order to allocate optimal conditions for superconductivity.
However, the detailed interplay between the crystal structure, magnetic ordering, and superconductivity is hardly under- stood up to now, which is to some extent due to the lack of precise structural data.
One of the most intensively investigated iron-based mate- rial is BaFe2As2 with the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure.3 The stoichiometric compound undergoes a structural phase transition associated with antiferromagnetic ordering spin- density wave, SDW at Ttr=140 K. Superconductivity emerges during the antiferromagnetic ordering gets sup- pressed, which can be achieved by hole or electron doping4,16 or by applying external pressure.9 From the latter it seems easy to conceive that also the so-called ‚Äúchemical pressure‚Äù by substituting arsenic for the smaller phosphorus atoms induces superconductivity in LaOFeAs1‚àíxPx Ref.
17 and BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2.15 The au- thors explain the appearance of superconductivity as a con- sequence of the shrinking unit-cell volume in analogy to the effects of external pressure.
On the other hand, the unit cell shrinks comparably by substituting barium for smaller stron- tium atoms in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 but no superconductivity ap- pears in this case.17 Thus, a pressure-volume effect is clearly an oversimpliÔ¨Åed explanation for superconductivity in the case of phosphorus-doped BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2.
This is more true, as the crystal structures of these compounds have not yet been investigated in detail.
We have therefore synthe- sized the series BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 and Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 and determined the crystal structures by high-resolution x-ray powder and single-crystal diffraction.
We compare the struc- tural data with theoretical models obtained by full-potential density-functional theory DFT calculations.
We will show that the suppression of the SDW ordering as precondition to the onset of superconductivity is not a simple volume effect but depends on a subtle reorganization of the crystal struc- ture. II.
METHODS Polycrystalline samples of Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 x=0‚Äì1 were synthesized by heating stoichiometric mixtures of the elements all purities 99.9% in alumina crucibles enclosed in silica tubes under an atmosphere of puriÔ¨Åed argon.
The mixtures were slowly heated to 1123 K, kept at this tempera- ture for 15 h, and cooled down to room temperature.
The reaction products were homogenized in an agate mortar and annealed three to four times at 1173 K for 15‚Äì25 h.
The obtained black metallic powders are slightly air sensitive and therefore handled under argon atmosphere.
Samples of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 with x=0‚Äì1 were synthesized by solid- state reaction of the elements likewise.
The stoichiometric mixtures were slowly heated to 1123 K 1173 K for 15 h.

The obtained black crystalline powders show no sensitivity to air or moisture.
Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy EDX measurements resulted in the nominal compositions within 10% regarding to the Ba:Sr and As:P ratios.
Samples between x0.3 and 0.6 are superconducting with critical temperatures up to 29 K. No superconductivity was found in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2.
Since both phase diagrams are known,15,17 we show only the ac-susceptibility measurement of a BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 sample with x0.4 as an example in Fig. 1.
The crystal structures of polycrystalline samples were de- termined by x-ray powder diffraction using a Huber G670 Guinier imaging plate diffractometer Cu K1 radiation, Ge- 111 monochromator. Rietveld reÔ¨Ånements were performed with the TOPAS package18 using the fundamental parameters approach as reÔ¨Çection proÔ¨Åles.
Due to a better description of small peak half width and shape anisotropy, the approach of Le Bail and Jouanneaux19 was implemented in the TOPAS program.
Giving consideration to possible texture effects, the March-Dollase function was used for description of a pre- ferred orientation of the crystallites.
Small platelike single crystals of 505020 m3 were selected from the polycrystalline samples and checked by Laue photographs using white radiation from a Mo anode.
Diffraction intensity data up to 2=80¬∞ were collected with an Oxford Xcalibur four-circle  diffractometer equipped with a charge-coupled-device detector.
Graphite- monochromized Mo K radiation from a conventional sealed tube was used.
The intensities were carefully corrected for absorption effects.

Electronic-structure calculations were performed with the WIEN2K package21 using density-functional theory within the full-potential linear augmented plane wave LAPW method and the general gradient approximation.
Detailed descrip- tions are given elsewhere.22 LAPW is based on the mufÔ¨Ån- tin construction with nonoverlapping spheres and a plane- wave expansion in the interstitial regions.
Mixed LAPW and APW+lo lo=local orbitals basis sets were used to increase the efÔ¨Åciency of the APW linearization.23 Further technical details are given in the monograph of Singh.24 III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. SDW suppression in BaFe2(As1‚àíxPx)2 and (Ba1‚àíxSrx)Fe2As2 The unit-cell volumes of the solid solution series BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 and Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 together with the data of the high-pressure experiments by Kimber et al.25 are col- lected in Fig. 2.
Superconductivity indicated by circles in- deed appears by pressure and by P doping within the same volume range between 192 and 199 √Ö3, which is marked by the dashed lines.
But on the other hand, no superconductivity emerges by Sr doping in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2, even though the unit-cell volumes are within the same range.
Obviously, the simple shrinking of the unit cell is not the decisive condition.
Superconductivity is absent in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 because Sr doping cannot suppress the magnetic and structural transi- tion.
The latter becomes only shifted to higher temperatures, as depicted in Fig. 3.
In order to shed light on this apparent contradiction, a detailed look at the crystal structures is indispensable.
First, we have reÔ¨Åned the x-ray powder data by the Rietveld method.

ROTTER, HIEKE, AND JOHRENDT PHYSICAL REVIEW B 82, 014513 2010 014513-2I4/mmm. The doping dependencies of the normalized Fe-Pn bond lengths are plotted in Fig. 4. Sr- and P-doped BaFe2As2 show very different behavior, respectively.
While the Fe-As bond lengths in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 remain almost constant across the whole doping range despite the shrinking unit cell, the Fe-Pn distances decrease strongly with increas- ing P content in BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2.
This strongly suggests that a shortening of the Fe-Pn bonds is necessary to suppress the SDW transition.
The latter is plausible since it is well known that the Fe-As bond length dramatically inÔ¨Çuences the magnetism in iron arsenides.26,27 As a Ô¨Årst approach, we assume that de- creasing bond lengths increase the bandwidth, thus a mag- netic ground state becomes less stable as the bonds get shorter.
Figure 5 shows sections of the band structures with the approximate bandwidths of the Fe dxz,yz bands, which should be strongly effected by the Fe-Pn interaction.
We Ô¨Ånd that the bandwidth of BaFe2P2 is much larger +35% com- pared with BaFe2As2.
But in the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe2As2, the bandwidth is almost identical to BaFe2As2, even though the volume is signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller.
B. Dependency of the magnetic moment on the Fe-As distance To support this assumption, we have calculated the depen- dency of the magnetic moment on the Fe-As bond lengths using a full-potential DFT method.
It is well known that DFT is unable to describe the exact value of the magnetic moment and the correct structure at the same time.28 But on the other hand, it should be possible to get at least the changes in the magnetic moment as the Fe-As distance decreases.
Thus we have selected a zAs value, which gives approximately the experimental moment of 0.8 B/Fe.
Then we used the Ô¨Åxed-spin-moment method to calculate z values by varying the magnetic moments between 0 and 1.2 B/Fe and relax- ing the structures subsequently.
We Ô¨Ånd that the moment gets rapidly depleted as the Fe-As distance decreases see Fig. 6 and a shrinking of 2.5 pm 1% is sufÔ¨Åcient to suppress the magnetism completely.
This is a rather simpliÔ¨Åed approach since we used a ferromagnetic spin structure and kept the volume constant.
For this reason, also the As-Fe-As angle varies about 1.5%, thus it is not a priori clear whether the bond angle or bond distance is the crucial parameter.
To check the validity of our simple model, we performed full optimizations of the structure volume, z,  using a G-type spin structure in order to model the AF magnetic interactions in the tetragonal phase.
Figure 7 shows how the total energy and the magnetic moment depend on the bond distances and angles.
The energy surface has a minimum somewhat beyond the experimental data as usual for BaFe2As2, here also owing to the crude approximation of the magnetic structure.
More important is the fact that the magnetic moment varies strongly with the Fe-As distance but only slightly with the As-Fe-As angle.
This model, al- though still simpliÔ¨Åed, indicates that the Fe-As distance is the crucial parameter which determines the magnetic mo- ment, in agreement with recent results reported by Johannes 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 -6 -4 -2 0 Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 ‚àÜd/d (Fe-Pn) (%) xP/Sr BaFe2(As1‚àíxPx)2 FIG.

DIFFERENT RESPONSE OF THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE‚Ä¶ PHYSICAL REVIEW B 82, 014513 2010 014513-3and Mazin.27 Thus, we can assume that the small shifts of the distance plotted in Fig. 6 are associated with the suppression of the SDW state.
It is worthwhile to note that the suppression of the SDW in BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 may not necessarily be caused by the shrinking Fe-As bonds.
One may also argue that the increas- ing number of Fe-P contacts enlarges the bandwidth until the magnetic ground state becomes unstable.
In this case, the contraction of the Fe-As bonds would be the consequence of the lost magnetism rather than its origin.
However, this in- terpretation emphasizes that the Fe-As bond is in any case the gauge for the magnetic moment, as pointed out recently.27 By comparing these results with the data in Fig. 4, we Ô¨Ånd that the shrinking of the Fe-As distances in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 is only 1 pm ‚àí0.4% and thus not sufÔ¨Åcient to suppress the magnetism according to Fig. 6.
On the other hand, the decrease in the Fe-Pn bond lengths is much larger in BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 and evidently sufÔ¨Åcient to suppress the SDW.
Moreover, the calculated value of d d ‚àí1% coincides perfectly with the onset of superconductivity in BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 close to the doping value x0.25 as shown in Fig. 4.
Even though this scenario explains the difference between the Sr- and P-doped materials with respect to the onset of superconductivity, the data of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 in Fig. 4 have no physical meaning.
Phosphorous and arsenic cannot have the same coordinates in the unit cell otherwise the atomic distances would be unreasonable.
As an example, the data of Fig. 4 anticipate that the Fe-As and Fe-P bonds at x0.25 are about 236 pm.
This is still reasonable for a Fe-As bond but much too long for a Fe-P bond.
On the other hand, both distances would be 228 pm at x0.75, which is now accept- able for Fe-P, but impossible for an Fe-As bond.
C. Theoretical structure models In order to investigate the structural behavior of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 theoretically, we used crystallographically ordered superstructures.
The tetragonal space group P4¬Øm2 allows to calculate structural parameters for the doping levels x=0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 without changing the symmetry.
Dur- ing the optimization of the atom coordinates, all composi- tions except x=0 converged to nonmagnetic ground states.
Thus, the SDW state is already suppressed at x=0.25 in agreement with the experiment.
Furthermore, the zPn coordi- TABLE II.

Selected bond dis- tances are collected in Table I.
It is evident that the Fe-As bonds shrink signiÔ¨Åcantly only between x=0 and 0.25, accompanied by the loss of the mag- netic moment.
The contraction is about ‚àí1.4%, which is suf- Ô¨Åcient to suppress the SDW order as shown in Fig. 6.
But higher doping levels do not further contract the Fe-As bonds, in contrast to the data in Fig. 4.
At the same time, the Fe-P bonds remain close to the values of the pure phosphide.
These Ô¨Åndings draw a more realistic picture than Fig. 4 be- cause it combines the suppression of the SDW state by the appropriate contraction of the Fe-As bond with reasonable bond lengths along the whole doping range.
D. Single-crystal structure determination From the crystal chemical considerations given in Sec.
III B and the results of the theoretical calculations it is clear that the Fe-Pn bond lengths of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 obtained from Rietveld reÔ¨Ånements are throughout unsatisfactory, whereas the Fe-As distances in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2 are reason- able due to only one arsenic position.
For this reason, we have conducted high-resolution single-crystal x-ray structure determinations using small crystals tens of microns of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 with x0.3, 0.5, and 0.7.
Main results of the reÔ¨Ånements together with selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Table II.
As expected from chemi- cal reasons as well as predicted by theory, we Ô¨Ånd the P and As atoms at signiÔ¨Åcantly different z coordinates, resulting in different lengths of the Fe-As and Fe-P bonds.
The initial Fe-As distance is 240 pm and decreases rapidly up to 25% P doping but then converges to an almost constant value around 236 pm ‚àí1.7%.
At the same time, the Fe-P dis- tances remain about 1‚Äì2 pm longer than in BaFe2P2 at least up to 75% P doping.
These experimental Ô¨Åndings agree al- most quantitatively with the theoretical prediction, although theory is not able to produce the correct absolute values.
Figure 8 summarizes this reorganization of the crystal structures of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 in comparison with Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2.
A small contraction of the Fe-As bonds by ‚àí1.5% 2‚Äì3 pm is associated with the suppression of the SDW state, which is in turn the precondition to superconduc- tivity.
This happens by P doping, but not by Sr doping, where the Fe-As bonds shrink by less than 0.5%.
Even though we have focused at the Fe-As bonds, we suggest that the Fe-P interaction is the underlying origin of the SDW suppression.
Thus we have rather detected the re- sponse of the structure to the vanishing magnetic state.
Inter- estingly, a similar response was not observed in undoped BaFe2As2 under pressure,25 where superconductivity emerges despite the Fe-As bonds remain constant as in non- superconducting Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2. IV.
CONCLUSION We have shown that chemical pressure is an oversimpli- Ô¨Åed view, which is unsuitable to explain the different behav- ior of charge neutrally doped BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2 and Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2.
The true reason is the different response of the crystal structures to doping.
Phosphorus doping sup- presses the SDW state by increasing the width of the d bands, which in turn leads to shorter Fe-As bonds due to its strong coupling to the magnetic state.
No signiÔ¨Åcant contrac- tion of the Fe-As bond is detected in Ba1‚àíxSrxFe2As2, where the SDW state persists despite the similar volume change.
Single-crystal x-ray data revealed the correct struc- ture of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2, where arsenic and phosphorus are statistically distributed, but at different coordinates zAs and zP, which is necessary to obtain reasonable Fe-P and Fe-As bond lengths.
The latter contract strongly at low doping dur- ing the magnetism is suppressed 0x0.25 and con- verges to 236 pm at higher doping levels.
This behavior is almost quantitatively reproduced by DFT calculations using ordered model structures of BaFe2As1‚àíxPx2.
Our results strongly emphasize, that even subtle details of the crystal structures are crucial to magnetism and superconductivity in iron-based materials, where structural data have often been obtained from moderate powder patterns, which allow only limited resolution.
