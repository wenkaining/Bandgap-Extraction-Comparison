Recently, unconventional chiral charge order has been reported in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, with an ordering temperature of one order of magnitude higher than the TC.
However, the chirality of the charge order has not been reported in the cousin kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and the electronic nature of the chirality remains elusive.
In this paper, we report the observation of electronic chiral charge order in CsV3Sb5 via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
We observe a 2 × 2 charge modulation and a 1 × 4 superlattice in both topographic data and tunneling spectroscopy.
2 × 2 charge modulation is highly anticipated as a charge order by fundamental kagome lattice models at van Hove ﬁlling, and is shown to exhibit intrinsic chirality.
We ﬁnd that the 1 × 4 superlattices form various small domain walls, and can be a surface effect as supported by our ﬁrst-principles calculations.
Cru- cially, we ﬁnd that the amplitude of the energy gap opened by the charge order exhibits real-space modulations, and features 2 × 2 wave vectors with chirality, highlighting the electronic nature of the chiral charge order.
STM study at 0.4 K reveals a superconducting energy gap with a gap size 2 = 0.85 meV, which estimates a moderate superconductivity coupling strength with 2/kBTC = 3.9.
When further applying a c-axis magnetic ﬁeld, vortex core bound states are observed within this gap, indicative of clean-limit superconductivity.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.104.075148 I. INTRODUCTION Owing to the unusual lattice geometry, spins on kagome lattices can be geometrically frustrated and form a quan- tum spin liquid [1,2].
Similarly, a fundamental tight-binding model of kagome lattice considering the nearest-neighboring hopping will produce an intriguing electronic band structure containing Dirac cones, ﬂat band, and van Hove singularities.

†jiaxiny@princeton.edu ‡mzhasan@princeton.edu §ygyao@bit.edu.cn Thus, materials containing kagome lattices are an exciting platform to explore the quantum level interplay between geometry, correlation, and topology.
For instance, certain kagome magnets are found to exhibit electronic nematicity, giant spin-orbit tunability, and topological Chern quantum phases [3–16].
Kagome superconductors with competing or- ders have been identiﬁed for over 40 y [17–19], such as LaRu3Si2 with TC of 7 K and a fundamental kagome band structure [20].
Recently, another layered kagome supercon- ductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) was discovered with TC up to 2.5 K for A = Cs [21–23], providing new research avenues, particularly for transport and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies [21–33].

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS High-quality single crystals of CsV3Sb5 were grown by a self-ﬂux method with Cs-Sb binary eutectic mixture (Cs0.4Sb0.6) as the ﬂux [21].
We found that the molar ratio of Cs0.4Sb0.6 : CsV3Sb5 = 15 : 1 is the best condition for ob- taining large crystals with high quality.
In order to obtain high-quality crystals, it is necessary to perform surface treat- ment of raw materials in a hydrogen atmosphere [34,35].
Our crystals have shiny surfaces with a hexagonal shape, and the typical size of crystals is about 3 × 4 × 0.5 mm3, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 1(b).
The crystal structure was analyzed via x-ray diffraction using a θ-2θ scan.
The magnetic suscepti- bility and magnetization were measured in a physical property measurement system magnetometer in vibrating-sample mea- surement mode.
The transport property measurements were carried out in a ﬁve-contact conﬁguration so that the lon- gitudinal and Hall resistivity can be taken simultaneously.
STM data were obtained with a Pt/Ir tip at 4.2 and 0.4 K. The topographic data were obtained in a constant current mode with bias voltage V = 50 mV and current I = 0.05 nA. Spectroscopic data were obtained with V = 50 mV and I = 0.5 nA, V = 50 mV at 4.2 K, and V = 5 mV and I = 0.1 nA at 0.4 K. III.
TRANSPORT AND TUNNELING RESULTS CsV3Sb5 crystallizes in the hexagonal P6/mmm space group and consists of V-Sb slabs that are intercalated by cesium cation, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
The most notable feature in this compound is that the vanadium sublattice forms a 2D kagome net.
X-ray-diffraction pattern displays sharp (00l) reﬂection peaks, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
The full width at half maximum of (004) peak is only 0.07°, as shown in the right inset of Fig. 1(b).
Both resistivity data [Fig. 1(c)] and susceptibility data [Fig. 1(d)] show two phase transitions.
The 90 K transition corresponds to the development of a charge order, and the 2.5 K transition corresponds to the development of superconductivity.
Below the charge order transition tem- perature, previous studies reveal the possibility of anomalous Hall effect [24,25].
Similar to these studies, at 5 K, both the magnetization data [Fig. 1(f)] and the Hall resistivity data [Fig. 1(e)] as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld applied along the c axis show a double-kink feature.
By further subtracting a linear background as the ordinary Hall response, this unusual Hall response would resemble an anomalous Hall effect, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(e).
Our low-ﬁeld magnetization loop data in the inset of Fig. 1(f) also conﬁrm the absence of magnetic hysteresis.

effect and increasing magnetization below charge ordering temperature with decreasing temperature implies the highly unconventional nature of the charge order.
In this material, the V and Sb layers have a stronger chem- ical bonding, and the material tends to cleave between Cs and Sb layers.
The Sb surface is most interesting, as it is strongly bonded to the V kagome lattice.
Previous STM studies have resolved Sb honeycomb surfaces in AV3Sb5, and studied the charge order and surface superlattices [20–26].
We study CsV3Sb5 with STM at 4.2 K. Through cryogenic cleaving, we have also obtained large Sb surfaces in CsV3Sb5, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
Similar to KV3Sb5 [28], we observe a soft charge order gap opening from −23 to +35 meV [Fig. 2(b)].
The Fourier transform of the topography conﬁrms the 2 × 2 charge order as marked by the shaded red region in Fig. 2(c), which is ubiquitous for all AV3Sb5 compounds.
In defect-free areas of KV3Sb5 and RbV3Sb5, the 2 × 2 charge order is found to display a chirality [28,29], where its three vector peaks have different intensities.
We thus perform a spectroscopic map in a defect-free area [Fig. 1(d)] for CsV3Sb5 to check the existence of the chirality.
The energy-resolved intensity of three 2 × 2 vector peaks is displayed in Fig. 2(e), where we observe clear intensity differences.
The observed anisotropy can be due to a chiral charge order as observed and discussed in certain transition-metal dichalcogenides and high-temperature superconductors [36,37].
The chirality can be deﬁned as the counting direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) from the low- est to the highest pair of vector peaks.
By contrast, near a defect-rich region [Fig. 2(f)], we ﬁnd that there is almost no chirality for the charge order [Fig. 2(g)], which suggests the existence of extrinsic effects.
In both cases, the intensity of Q1 is strongest, and along this direction, there are additional 1 × 4 superlattice vector peaks in the q-space data [Fig. 2(c)].
This observation suggests an interplay between the 1 × 4 superlattice and 2 × 2 charge order.
The 1 × 4 superlattice is not observed on the Sb surface in KV3Sb5 [28], certain Sb surface in CsV3Sb5 [30], and the K/Cs/Rb surfaces in AV3Sb5.
We also ﬁnd many domains of the 1 × 4 superlattice, including 120° domains [Fig. 3(a)] and phase-shift domains [Fig. 3(b)].
The domain size can be very small (less than 10 nm), which will not be energy favorable if it is bulk in nature.
In addition, bulk x-ray measurements have detected the 2 × 2 charge order but have not yet observed the 1 × 4 superlattice [ [21],28].
Therefore, these pieces of experimental evidence taken together suggest that the 1 × 4 superlattice effect is likely to be fragile and of surface origin.

lower after surface optimizations at 0 K, indicating that the surface reconstruction occurs spontaneously.
Kinetic cutoff energy of 600 eV and spacing of 2π × 0.03 Å-1 for Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh sampling were adopted to give well-converged total energies (∼1 meV/atom).
For another example, it is known that the 1 × 2 superlattice observed by STM in BaFe2As2 is a polar surface effect [38], and there can be various small domain walls of the 1 × 2 su- perlattices, as similarly observed here.
To explore the surface origin possibility, we perform ﬁrst-principles calculations.
The geometry optimizations of surface atoms were performed in the framework of density-functional theory with the projec- tor augmented wave method and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional [39], which are implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [40].
We built two types of 1 × 4 supercells slabs, repeating the primitive cell in two different directions: parallel (type A) and vertical (type B) to the a axis.
After fully relaxed surface atoms, we found only the type-B slab is stabilized into the 1 × 4 supercell, which is consistent with our experimental measurements.
Our calculations show that 1 × 4 supercells are due to the in-plane shifting of V atoms relative to surface Sb atoms, as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 3(c).
Previous ﬁrst-principles calculation [28,41] in AV3Sb5 has also conﬁrmed that the 2 × 2 charge order is a bulk effect and is consistent with a hexamer and trimer formation [28] (or termed as inverse star of David formation [41]) in the V kagome lattice.
The chirality feature of the charge order, however, is beyond the current ﬁrst-principles calculation.
Prior to any theoretical discussion of the origin of chirality, it is crucial to explore whether the chirality is of electronic nature.
An issue in the differential conductance mapping pre- sented in Fig. 2 is that it cannot distinguish the electronic contribution from the structural contribution, as the tunnel- ing junction setup can often have a dependence on structure features.
However, it is generally believed that the energy gap of the charge order is of electronic origin.
We therefore systematically measure the energy gap of the charge order at each spatial point and map out the spatial distribution of the charge order gap value as shown in Fig. 4(a), which reveals a striking spatial modulation of the energy gap value.
The Fourier transform of the gap map in Fig. 4(b) shows the 2 × 2 vector peaks with clear anisotropy, thus similarly deﬁning a chirality in the electronic charge order.
We have further checked this phenomenon in the cousin kagome supercon- ductor RbV3Sb5 in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), and observed similar chirality of the electronic charge order.
In Fig. 4(e), we show typical linecut dI/dV spectra along the line drawn in Fig. 4(c), further illustrating the charge order gap modulation in real space. IV.
DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS The observation of electronic chiral charge order is un- precedented in the studying of quantum materials, and can be highly related to the electronic nature of kagome lattice at van Hove ﬁlling as in AV3Sb5 [42–46].
In contrast to the hon- eycomb lattice, the kagome lattice has three sublattices, and the kagome lattice at van Hove ﬁlling exhibits unequal pre- dominant sublattice occupancy [42].
With extended Coulomb interactions considered, this sublattice interference mecha- nism will produce a chiral charge order with relative angular momentum [44].

parameter has also been proposed to interact with the under- lying topological band structure of this material to produce a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect [28,43–45], which is consistent with the transport data.
Another anomalous fea- ture of the chiral charge order is that it can carry orbital currents [28,43,44,46], analogous to the fundamental Haldane model [47] and Varma model [48].
A tantalizing visualization of the orbital magnetism is recently reported by muon spin spectroscopy, and a spontaneous internal magnetic ﬁeld is observed just below the charge ordering temperature [49].
Finally, we explore the superconducting tunneling spec- trum at 0.4 K, well below the superconducting transition temperature.
Consistent with previous reports [30,32,33], the tunneling spectrums show an energy gap with a gap size 2 = 0.85 meV determined by the coherence peak-to-peak distance [Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)].
Accordingly, we obtain the supercon- ductivity coupling strength 2/kBTC = 3.9, which is slightly larger than the standard BCS value and suggests the electron pairing is close to a moderate coupling.
By applying a 50-mT magnetic ﬁeld along the c axis, we observe a zero-energy vortex core state [Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)].
The formation of a clear vortex core bound state implies that the superconducting state is in the clean limit, where the electron mean-free path is much longer than the superconducting coherent length.
One notable observation in the superconducting state is that the gap is shallow, and the measured gap is ﬁlled with substantial states.
The origin of the in-gap states deserves future attention with lower temperature and higher energy resolution measure- ments.
If such states are intrinsic and robust, then it is worthy of discussing further their relationship with the tantalizing broken-symmetry [32,49] of the superconducting state. FIG.
