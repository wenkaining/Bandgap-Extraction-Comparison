We have car- ried out additional magnetic and dielectric studies to understand the properties well below TN.
We emphasize here on the following: (i) A strong frequency dependent behaviors of ac magnetic suscep- tibility and complex dielectric properties have been observed at much lower temperatures (<8 K), that is, “reentrant multiglass-like” phenomenon, naturally suggesting the existence of an additional transition well below TN.
(ii) “Magnetoelectric phase coexistence” is observed at very low tempera- ture (e.g., T ¼ 2 K), where the high-ﬁeld magnetoelectric phase is partially arrested on returning to zero magnetic ﬁeld after a cycling through metamagnetic transition.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4896171] INTRODUCTION The Haldane1 spin-chain systems of the type, R2BaNiO5 (R ¼ Rare-earths), have been paid a lot of atten- tion for the past few decades from magnetism angle.
Recently, some members of this family (R ¼ Gd, Dy, Ho, and Er) of oxides attracted further interest from the angle of magnetoelectric (ME)/magnetodielectric (MDE) coupling phenomenon.2–6 A systematic study on the Er member5 sug- gested that a displacive-type mechanism involving magnetic ions is responsible for the onset of ferroelectricity well above its Neel temperature (TN ¼ 32 K) and that short-range magnetic correlations are interestingly sufﬁcient enough to induce the same.
In the case of Dy member,3 it was noted that, in addition to the multiferroic behavior setting in at (TN¼) 58 K, there is an additional transition at temperatures (T) well below TN, as though there is a “reentrant phenomen- on” into a complex multiglass-like state below 10 K. Such a phenomenon is not so commonly known particularly among undoped stoichiometric compounds in the ﬁeld of multifer- roics, barring a few examples (see, Refs. 5, 7, and articles cited therein), though the concept of multi-glass was origi- nally discussed in some doped materials.8 It is therefore of interest to study low temperature properties of other mem- bers of this family well below their respective TN.
With this primary motivation, in this article, we report the results of our investigation on the Er member well below its TN.
The results reveal that there are glassy anomalies both in mag- netization and dielectric properties far below TN, character- izing that this compound also belongs to a new family of “reentrant” multiferroic oxides.
Additionally, there are fea- tures in the isothermal data attributable to “magnetoelectric phase-co-existence” phenomenon.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Polycrystalline form of the compound, Er2BaNiO5, employed in the present investigation is the same as that in Ref. 5.
The ac susceptibility (v) measurements with various frequencies () with an ac ﬁeld of 1 Oe were performed as a function of T with the help of a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum Design (QD), USA) magnetometer.
In addition, dc magnetization (M) data were obtained with the help of a commercial (QD) vibrating sam- ple magnetometer.
The complex dielectric permittivity measurements with different  were performed as described in Ref. 5.
All the T-dependent studies were carried out in the presence of external dc magnetic ﬁelds (H) as well.
Unless otherwise stated, all the measurements were performed dur- ing warming after cooling the specimen in the absence of an external magnetic-ﬁeld from the paramagnetic state to the desired temperature.
Further experimental details can be obtained from Ref.
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Magnetic and dielectric behavior and multi-glass-like behavior Though T-dependent dc v behavior is available in the past literature,9 for the sake of characterization, we report our results obtained in a ﬁeld of 100 Oe for zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooled (FC) conditions in Figure 1.
The Curie-Weiss temperature and the effective moment obtained from the linear region in the paramagnetic state are about 11 K (with the negative sign consistent with antiferromag- netic interaction) and 14 lB per formula unit, respectively.
We derive that the moment on Ni is 3.5 lB/Ni considering the theoretical moment for Er (9.58 lB/Er3þ).
The feature at TN is so feeble that this can be observed in the derivative curve only (see inset (a) in Figure 1).

A careful inspection of the data in the mainframe of Figure 1 reveals that there is an upturn in v(T) with decreas- ing temperature near 4 K with a tendency for the bifurcation of ZFC and FC curves.
At the same temperature, heat- capacity (C) data exhibit a shoulder.5 Similar behavior was observed in the data measured in 5 kOe (not shown here).
This observation indicates that there is another anomaly around this temperature.
At this moment, it is worth recalling the evolution process of spontaneous magnetic moments from Er to Ni below TN as revealed by neutron diffraction results.10,11 Though spontaneous moment appears for both Er and Ni at the onset of magnetic ordering, the T-dependen- cies are markedly different; that is, the increase of the Er magnetic moment with decreasing temperature was reported to be rather large for Er, whereas the Ni moment tends to increase only marginally below 30 K. A point to be inferred from the previous neutron diffraction results is that there is no additional well-deﬁned magnetic transition at tempera- tures well below 32 K; however, for the magnetic moment on Er, there is a change of curvature over a wide temperature range around 15–20 K, followed by a tendency to saturate below 5 K. Clearly, therefore, the anomalies observed in v(T) (as well as in heat-capacity5) around 16 K should be associated with these broad thermal variations of the mag- netic moment on Er, and not to any magnetic transition.
It is argued that the 16 K-anomalies arise from the splitting of the Kramer’s doublet of trivalent Er by the exchange interaction, followed by depopulation with decreasing temperature.12 However, the feature below 4 K could arise from another subtle magnetic phase transition, and there is also an evi- dence from Young’s modulus reported by Chepurko et al.13 In order to get a better insight into the nature of mag- netic state below 4 K, we have also measured isothermal remnant magnetization (MIRM) behavior at various tempera- tures.
For this purpose, the specimen was zero-ﬁeld-cooled from 300 K to the desired T, then a dc ﬁeld of 5 kOe was applied and kept for 10 min; subsequently, the MIRM was measured as a function of time (t) in zero-ﬁeld.
We could see a decay of MIRM with time at 2 K (see inset b in Figure 1) as expected for spin-glass freezing.14 The curve was ﬁtted to a stretched exponential form ([MIRM (t)/MIRM (0)] ¼ a þ b exp[(t/s)0.5], where a and b here are coefﬁcients, s is the relaxation time).
Interestingly, no such magnetic relaxation behavior was observed at T ¼ 5 K and above.
This result sug- gests that there is a difference in the magnetic states below and above 5 K. We have measured ac v response for various values of  in the magnetically ordered state (see Figure 2) and the fea- tures in the real part (v0) observed in the data measured in the absence of magnetic-ﬁeld are somewhat similar to those observed in the dc v data.
Additionally, the feature below 6 K shows a -dependence with noticeable imaginary com- ponent (v00); it is to be noted that the peak in v00 appears (near 6 K) only for the highest frequency employed (1.339 kHz), whereas at lower frequencies, just an upturn only could be observed, as though there is a peak below 2 K for such frequencies.
Viewing together all these data, it appears that the fea- ture in the region 2–6 K is quite complex, attributable to spin-glass-like behavior (in the absence of an external mag- netic ﬁeld), particularly considering non-vanishing v00 component.14 The plot of T-dependence of dielectric permittivity (e0) and loss factor (tand) in the absence of dc magnetic-ﬁeld is shown in Figure 3(a) at various frequencies.
The results across TN were discussed in Ref.
5 and hence we restrict the present discussions to the data at further lower temperatures.
For this reason, we have restricted the data in the mainframe FIG. 1.

The values of tand are very low consistent with the insulating behavior of this compound, so that the observed features are not extrinsic.
There is a change of cur- vature in the vicinity of 16–20 K, clearly visible for some frequencies (see insets), tracking magnetic anomalies in C(T) and v(T), as though dielectric measurements are sensitive to crystal-ﬁeld effects.
A frequency dependent behavior could be seen in the data at low temperatures.
A noteworthy feature is that there is a fall in e0 below 8 K with a concomitant anomaly (a peak) in tand.
It is worthwhile to note that the highest  (1.339 kHz) employed in ac v studies is close to the lowest  (5 kHz) in dielectric studies and the temperature at which the anomaly is seen in both these data at these fre- quencies are somewhat close; as the  is increased from 5 kHz to 100 kHz, the temperature at which the dielectric anomaly (say, a fall in e0) occurs increases marginally to 10 K. Considering these observations, one safely assumes that the 10 K-anomaly observed in this property is a conse- quence of the magnetic anomaly well below 6 K. The inset of Figure 3(a) shows the plot of ln versus inverse of T, ﬁtted to Arrhenius law ( ¼ 0 exp(Ea/kBT), 0 ¼ pre-exponential factor, Ea ¼ activation energy, T refers to the peak tempera- ture in tand) and it is found that this plot is linear with an activation energy of 86 K. It was sufﬁciently stressed earlier5 that dielectric anomalies track the features (<6 K, 16 K, 32 K) in C and v data, speaking in favor of ME coupling in this compound.
Here, we emphasize that the -dependence of the features in the same temperature range (below 10 K) both in ac v and complex dielectric properties prompts us to infer that this compound exhibits “reentrant multiglass-like” behavior, taking into account that the coupling occurring near TN is not of a glassy type, in analogy to the terminology applied for re-entrant spin-glasses.
This observation is inter- esting, as this kind of “reentrant multiglass phenomenon” has been rarely reported for stoichiometric compounds, e.g., in Dy2BaNiO5 (Ref. 3) and Ca3Co2O6.7 As in the case of Dy2BaNiO5, an additional signature of spin-glass, viz., “local dip” (or “memory effects”) in the dc v experiments, performed with waiting and without waiting at a given tem- perature, could not be resolved down to 2 K and hence “glassiness” is of a different origin, e.g., slow and complex dynamics arising from antiferromagnetically coupled Er and Ni magnetic moments.
Influence of external dc magnetic fields on multiglass-like features It is of interest to see how an application of external mag- netic ﬁelds inﬂuences the magnetic and dielectric features.
For this purpose, the data were collected, while warming after cooling the sample in zero magnetic-ﬁeld.
It may be recalled5 that, in the heat-capacity data taken in the presence of several magnetic ﬁelds, the temperature at which the peak occurs in C/T (around 16 K) gets lowered gradually with increasing magnetic ﬁelds.
In the same manner, the corresponding broad peak (appearing around 16 K) in ac v(T) data for H ¼ 0 (see Figure 2) also shifts towards low temperatures with the appli- cation of magnetic ﬁeld (for instance, with the fall in v0 occur- ring below around 5 K for 30 kOe, see Figure 2).
As already remarked, these features are not strictly due to magnetic tran- sitions, but due to an interplay between crystal-ﬁeld effect and Zeeman Effect.
The -dependent component of v00 appearing below 6 K, which was proposed to arise from a magnetic anomaly at much lower temperatures also gets sup- pressed towards a lower temperature gradually (for instance, the peak in v00 for  ¼ 1.339 kHz gets shifted from 6 K to 4 K as the H is increased to 30 kOe).
Also, -dependent behavior becomes less with the application of magnetic ﬁeld (for instance, frequency dependence is 1 K for a variation from 1.3 Hz to 1.339 kHz for 30 kOe in v00).
An application of mag- netic ﬁeld of 50 kOe further suppresses this low T feature, although the data are noisy for highest frequency.
Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the -dependent dielectric behavior under application of different magnetic ﬁelds.
As discussed earlier5 in favour of ME coupling, the peak tem- perature for a particular frequency shifts towards lower tem- peratures with increasing magnetic ﬁeld, closely tracking the trend observed in v00 and C(T).

It is interesting to note that the -dependent behavior of dielec- tric constant persists even in the presence of a ﬁeld as high as 80 kOe, though the magnitude of the shift of characteristic temperature gets relatively reduced (not shown here).
This -dependent behavior almost vanishes by an application of a very high ﬁeld of 140 kOe [Fig. 3(c)].
We could not measure ac v above 50 kOe with our equipment for a comparative study at such high ﬁelds.
Nevertheless, we can state that the tracking of the peak temperatures in ac v and e0 supports MDE coupling in this compound.
It may be recalled that, for the compound Dy2BaNiO5, with increasing H, the low- temperature feature due to magnetism shifts towards higher T, whereas the one in dielectric shifts towards lower T.3 This difference between Dy and Er compounds could be due to subtle differences in magnetic interactions and magnetic structure.9–11 A signature of magnetoelectric phase coexistence Evidence for magnetodielectric coupling was obtained from the steps in the isothermal M(H) and e0(H) curves ear- lier.5 The isothermal curves obtained by magnetic-ﬁeld cy- cling reveal information about additional phenomenon, namely, phase-coexistence.
The results of such measure- ments of e0 as a function of H at different temperatures (with a rate of variation of 70 Oe/s) are presented in the form of magnetodielectric (De0 ¼ [(e0H¼0- e0H)/e0H¼0]) effect in Figure 4.
In the virgin curve at 2 K, there is a sudden upturn in the value around 20 kOe (and another weak one near 30 K), tracking the steps in M(H) (see also Ref. 5).
It appears that these steps are due to disorder-broadened ﬁrst-order transitions.
As a consequence of this, the virgin curve should lie outside the envelope curve for a travel through a ﬁrst-order transition for any phenomena,15 in the event that the high-ﬁeld phase is retained at least partially on returning the magnetic ﬁeld to zero, as observed experimentally in our case.
It is thus interesting to note that e0 in zero-ﬁeld after the ﬁeld-cycling attains a higher value compared to the vir- gin state zero-ﬁeld value, as though there is an evidence for “magnetoelectric phase co-existence” phenomenon.
We could not resolve such a signature of “magnetic phase-co- existence” in the isothermal magnetization data, although an extremely weak hysteresis (in the range 20–60 kOe) charac- teristic of ﬁrst-order transition is observed around the meta- magnetic transition ﬁelds (not shown here).
Additional isothermal measurements were also performed in the fol- lowing manner.
The sample was magnetic-ﬁeld-cooled from paramagnetic region (say, 200 K) to 2 K with different mag- netic ﬁelds and then the ﬁeld was removed; the isothermal ﬁeld-dependent dielectric measurements were then per- formed with a sweep rate of 70 Oe/s (Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)).
It is found that an application of magnetic ﬁeld of 50 kOe decreases the degree of partial arrest and this phase- coexistence phenomenon vanishes by an application of very high ﬁelds (say, 140 kOe).
These peculiar features in dielec- tric (without similar anomalies in isothermal magnetization) have been observed by us in another compound Ca3Co2O6,7 thereby suggesting that this discrepancy should be more common, thereby tempting the community to search for similar materials to understand the dynamics associated with dielectric phase coexistence phenomenon.
The feature attributable to phase-coexistence phenomenon is not observed at higher temperatures (above 5 K) [see Fig. 4(d) for T ¼ 8 K], clearly indicating a change in the magnetic state across these temperatures.
CONCLUSIONS We have investigated the Haldane spin-chain com- pound, Er2BaNiO5, at temperatures below its long-range antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of 32 K by ac and dc magnetization as well as dielectric studies.
Apart from the fact that the dielectric property captures the features due to the crystal-ﬁeld effects proposed in the literature, the results provide evidence for another magnetic anomaly below 6 K. It turns out that the 6 K-anomaly characterizes this com- pound “reentrant multi-glass-like,” based on frequency de- pendence of ac susceptibility and dielectric properties.
As a manifestation of metamagnetic transition, “magnetoelectric phase coexistence” is observed at very low temperatures.
