Here, we report on the realization of metallic conductance in a CaTiO3-based system, CaTiO3/LaTiO3 superlattices, epitaxially grown in a layer-by-layer way on a NdGaO3(110) substrate by pulsed laser deposition.
The high quality of the crystal and electronic structures is characterized by in situ reﬂection high-energy electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.
Electrical transport conﬁrms the formation of metallic interfaces in the CaTiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice.
In addition, Hall measurements reveal that in the CaTiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice the room-temperature carrier mobility is nearly three times higher than that of the CaTiO3/YTiO3 superlattice, implying the importance of TiO6 octahedral tilts and rotations on the carrier mobility of a 2DEG.
Since doped CaTiO3 is an A-site polar metal, our results provide a materials system for designing synthetic two-dimensional polar metals.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.104008 I. INTRODUCTION The entanglement among charge, spin, orbital, and struc- tural degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides leads to a great number of emergent phenomena, one remarkable ex- ample of which is the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of two insulating compounds, e.g., SrTiO3/LaAlO3 [1,2], SrTiO3/γ -Al2O3 [3,4], SrTiO3/RTiO3 (R = La, Gd, Nd) [5–8], SrTiO3/LaVO3 [9], SrTiO3/LaGaO3 [10], and SrTiO3/DyScO3 [11].
Quantum many-body effects at the interfaces of transition metal oxides stimulate the for- mation of two-dimensional polar metals, magnetic 2DEGs, and the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism [12–17].
On the other hand, strong electronic correlations im- pose ultralow (0.1–10 cm2 V−1 s−1) room-temperature carrier mobilities of SrTiO3-based 2DEGs [18], which in turn hinders their practical applications for advanced electronic devices.
Surprisingly, almost all reported 2DEGs based on perovskite oxides are found in SrTiO3-based heterostructures; the two unique exceptions are KTaO3/LaTiO3 and CaTiO3/YTiO3 [19,20].
Therefore, the search and investigation of non-SrTiO3 (STO) based systems are essential and lacking thus far.
To address this issue, we concentrate on CaTiO3-based het- erostructures.
Here, we take the superlattice CaTiO3/LaTiO3 [CTO/LTO; see Fig. 1(a)] as a prototypical non-STO hetero- junction to explore the properties of a 2DEG in CaTiO3-based interfaces.
It is interesting to note that such a 2DEG was *ywcao@nimte.ac.cn recently discovered in the CaTiO3/YTiO3 (CTO/YTO) inter- face with large TiO6 octahedral distortions [see Fig. 1(b)] [20].
Naturally, there arises a question of whether the CTO/LTO interface is metallic or not.
Unlike YTO, the TiO6 octahedra in bulk LTO are much less distorted.
As shown in Fig. 1(c), in bulk LTO the Ti-O-Ti bond angle α is 157◦, whereas it is only 144◦in YTO, which results in a larger conduction band width of LTO of ∼2.45 eV vs 2.04 eV for YTO [21].
The Ti-O-Ti bond distortion can play a key role in determining the electri- cal transport properties [23] and potentially may lead to higher carrier mobility in CTO/LTO.
From a design standpoint, the LTO layer is carefully selected because its bond angle is very close to that of bulk CTO (∼156◦) [22,24].
Moreover, the lattice parameters of bulk CTO at room temperature, a = 5.38 Å, b = 5.44 Å, c = 7.64 Å (in the orthorhom- bic setting), are well matched with the lattice parameters of the NdGaO3 (NGO) substrate, a = 5.43 Å, b = 5.50 Å, c = 7.71 Å [25].
In this paper, we report on the layer-by-layer synthe- sis of high-quality CTO/LTO superlattices by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).
The high quality of the crystal and elec- tronic structures is characterized by reﬂection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), x-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).
The formation of conduction electrons in CTO/LTO is veriﬁed by temperature-dependent electrical transport, revealing a room- temperature carrier mobility in CTO/LTO nearly triple that in more distorted CTO/YTO. 2475-9953/2020/4(10)/104008(5) 104008-1 ©2020 American Physical SocietySHAOZHU XIAO et al.

laser operating at λ = 248 nm and a pulse rate of 2 Hz.
The growth details are analogous to the previously reported results on CTO ﬁlms and CTO/YTO superlattices [20,26].
The high quality of the superlattices was veriﬁed by both in situ RHEED and ex situ XRD (Cu Kα1, λ = 1.5406 Å).
To investigate the electronic structure, composition, and va- lence states of the superlattices, XPS (monochromated Al Kα radiation, hν = 1486.6 eV) was performed on all the samples.
Sheet resistances and the Hall effect were measured between 2 and 300 K using a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design PPMS Ever Cool-II) in the van der Pauw geometry.
The cross-sectional TEM specimens for STEM in- vestigations were prepared with the lift-out technique using an FEI Helios 600i FIB/SEM dual-beam system.
The ﬁnal thinning and removal of amorphous layers of the FIB spec- imen was carried out with a Gatan precision ion polishing system II (PIPS II).
The atomic-scale high-angle annular dark- ﬁeld (HAADF-STEM) images were collected with a Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Titan cubed Themis G2 300 microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a probe aberration corrector and monochromator.
The convergence angle used to record the HAADF-STEM images is 29.4 mrad, and the inner and outer angles are 90 and 200 mrad for the HAADF detector, respectively. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 2 shows the crystal structure of the CTO/LTO su- perlattice.
As seen in Figs. 2(b)–2(d), sharp RHEED patterns from the CTO and LTO layers during epitaxy indicate layer- by-layer growth of CTO/LTO superlattices.
The observation of clear half-order peaks [white arrows in Figs. 2(b)–2(d)] conﬁrms the orthorhombic symmetry of the superlattice.
To further investigate the structural details of the sample, we 104008-2METALLIC INTERFACES IN A CaTiO3/LaTiO3 … PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 4, 104008 (2020) (a) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 50.0 49.0 48.0 47.0 46.0 45.0 44.0 43.0 (b) 2θ-ω(degrees) 2θ-ω(degrees) Intensity (a.u.)

carried out XRD scan measurements on the superlattice.
As seen from the wide-range 2θ-ω scan shown in Fig. 3(a), no detectable secondary phase is present.
Around the sharp peak from the NGO substrate at 2θ = 47.06◦, a broad ﬁlm peak [indicated by a triangle in Fig. 3(b)] with pronounced thickness fringes is observed, further conﬁrming the excellent crystallinity of the superlattices.
By ﬁtting of the thickness oscillations [see Fig. 3(b)], the overall thickness of the super- lattice is estimated to be 15.2 nm, consistent with the expected value of 16.2 nm from the superlattice geometry in Fig. 2(a).
To further investigate the quality of CTO/LTO superlattice, we carried out the STEM characterization.
Figure 4(a) shows the HAADF-STEM image in low magniﬁcation.
The dashed yellow lines indicate the top and bottom of the superlattice.
In order to protect the superlattice from damage, a Pt layer was deposited during focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation.
As seen, the superlattice is uniform with a thickness near 16 nm, which agrees well with the value of 15.2 nm esti- mated from the XRD data and the expected value of 16.2 nm.
Figure 4(b) shows the atomic resolution HAADF-STEM im- age of the superlattice at the interface between the ﬁlm and substrate.
The dashed yellow line indicates the location of the interface between the ﬁlm and substrate.
As seen, the as-grown ﬁlm shows an epitaxial registry to the substrate with the atomically sharp interface.
Next, to characterize the chemical composition and valence states of the superlattice, we carried out XPS at an acceptance angle of 90◦with the greatest penetration depth.
Figure 5(a) shows a wide-energy core-level XPS spectrum from 0 to 600 eV. As seen, besides adsorbed carbon on the superlattice surface, no discernible impurity signal is observed.
Next, we focus on the charge states of titanium in the CTO/LTO super- lattice.
As displayed in Fig. 5(b) , the dominant feature of the Ti 2p XPS spectrum is a doublet state.
The two main peaks at 464.9 and 459.1 eV are assigned to Ti4+ 2p1/2 and Ti4 + 2p3/2 peaks, respectively.
Shoulders at the low-binding-energy side of each peak represent a contribution from Ti3+ (Ti3+ 2p1/2 peak at ∼462.6 eV and Ti3+ 2p3/2 at 456.8 eV) [14,27].

interfacial charge transfer from LTO to CTO results in a mixed valency of the Ti3+/Ti4+ state and the formation of a 2DEG near the interface of the CTO/LTO superlattice.
To directly verify the formation of a 2DEG at the CTO/LTO interfaces, temperature-dependent resistance mea- surements were carried out.
As shown in Fig. 6, on cooling from 300 to 3 K, the sheet resistance per interface decreases from 4.2 to 2.1 k per square.
It is important to note that oxygen-doped LTO (or LaTiO3+δ) can be metallic [28].
To rule out this effect, we performed electrical transport on a 20-unit-cell-thick LTO ﬁlm.
As seen in Fig. 6(a), the sheet resistance increases from 60 to 110 k after cooling the sample from 300 to 100 K, which is characteristic of con- ventional insulating behavior.
Considering that the CTO ﬁlm, LTO ﬁlm, and NGO substrate are all insulating [see Fig. 6(a)] [20], the CTO/LTO interface is the only plausible conducting channel in the superlattice, thus conﬁrming the formation of a 2DEG at the CTO/LTO interface.
Next, to establish the type of charge carriers and estimate the carrier density, we measured the Hall resistance in vertical external magnetic ﬁelds from −3 to +3 T. The obtained Hall resistance is linear in an applied magnetic ﬁeld, and the slope indicates that conducting carriers in the CTO/LTO superlattice are electronlike.
As seen in Fig. 6(c) , the carrier density per in- terface of the CTO/LTO superlattice is 6.5 × 1014 cm−2 and essentially temperature independent, consistent with the value of SrTiO3/RTiO3 (STO/RTO) [18].
On the other hand, the carrier mobility increases from 2.3 to 4.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 from 300 to 3 K, the magnitude of which is almost three times larger than that (0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K) of the previously reported CTO/YTO interface [20].
Based on the tight-binding calcu- lations which include the effect of TiO6 distortions [21], the conduction band width of LTO (2.45 eV) is 19.6% larger than that of YTO (2.04 eV), which is a consequence of the larger Ti-O-Ti bond angle in LTO vs YTO.
Naturally, the higher carrier mobility in CTO/LTO compared with CTO/YTO su- perlattices results from the increased electron delocalization in the electronic band of LTO.
Interestingly, due to the fact that doped CaTiO3 is an A-site polar metal [29], our results imply a potentially novel way for designing two-dimensional polar metals.

CONCLUSION In summary, we synthesized high-quality CTO/LTO super- lattices by PLD and characterized their crystal and electronic structures by in situ RHEED, XRD, STEM, and XPS.
Temperature-dependent electrical transport conﬁrmed the for- mation of a conduction interface with high carrier density.
The electronlike carrier mobility in CTO/LTO superlattices is nearly three times higher than that of more strongly distorted CTO/YTO superlattices.
Our results provide a materials sys- tem to explore artiﬁcial A-site two-dimensional polar metals.
