B Vol. 30, No. 1 (2021) 017303 Optical conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle* Lu Wen(文露), Zhiqiang Li(李志强), and Yan He(贺言)† College of Physics, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China (Received 16 July 2020; revised manuscript received 17 August 2020; accepted manuscript online 9 September 2020) We theoretically study the band structure and optical conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the magic angle considering the effects of lattice relaxation.
We show that the optical conductivity spectrum is characterized by a series of peaks associated with the van Hove singularities in the band structure, and the peak energies evolve systematically with the twist angle.
Lattice relaxation effects in TBG modify its band structure, especially the ﬂat bands, which leads to signiﬁcant shifts of the peaks in the optical conductivity.
These results demonstrate that spectroscopic features in the optical conductivity can serve as ﬁngerprints for exploring the band structure, band gap, and lattice relaxation in magic-angle TBG as well as identifying its rotation angle.

Introduction The various van der Waals heterostructures assembled from two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a unique platform combining many novel physical properties.[1–4] The high level of interest in 2D materials, combined with capabilities in de- vice fabrication and experimental techniques, has led to an outburst of activity over the past few years.
One of the simplest heterostructures is twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), which consists of two graphene layers rotationally stacked at an arbitrary angle θ to each other.
At a small θ, a hexagonal long-period moir´e interference pattern consisting of alternat- ing AA- and AB-stacked regions emerges, owing to a slight difference in the lattice orientation.
When the twist angle θ is close to the ‘magic’ angle near 1.10∘,[5] the electronic band structure becomes ﬂat around the Dirac point at zero energy due to interlayer coupling.[6] The magic angle TBG has gained increased attention in theory and experiment in the last few years owing to its novel electronic properties.
Recent stud- ies on magic-angle TBG have discovered correlated insulat- ing phases with similarities to Mott insulator systems,[7] as well as strongly coupled superconducting states in ultra-ﬂat bands close to half-ﬁlling.[8,9] Furthermore, other intriguing quantum phenomena have been observed in magic-angle TBG, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).[10–14] These results make it possible to experimentally investigate both electronic correlations and topological phenomena in 2D van der Waals heterostructures.
Spectroscopic studies of electronic phenomena are critical to explore the physical properties in graphene- based systems.[15,16] Optical spectrum can provide criti- cal information about the electronic band structure,[17,18] many-body interactions,[19,20] quasiparticles,[21] and col- lective excitations[22] in graphene systems.
Moreover, graphene is very promising for applications in optics[23] and optoelectronics[24] due to its unique mechanical, electric, mag- netic, and thermal properties.
A multitude of exciting appli- cations of graphene, such as novel optical devices and pho- todetectors, are being vigorously pursued by academia and industry.[25] Previously, the optical conductivity of TBG heterostruc- tures has also been considered.
Koshino et al.[26] systemati- cally investigated the conductivity spectra of TBG with a vari- ety of large rotation angle θ (from 1.47∘to 30∘).
Bascones et al.[27] studied the effect of symmetry breaking states on the optical response, focusing on the incident photon energy range below 50 meV (corresponding wavelength λ ≈25 µm).
Our results highlight the optical conductivity of magic-angle TBG across a broader spectral range considering the effects of lattice relaxation, which is complementary to previous re- ports.
In addition, another notable disagreement with previous results is that our results are more directly relevant to the ex- periment.
At present, the area with uniform twist angle θ in TBG samples is only 3–5 µm in size or even smaller, due to the constraints of device fabrication and experimental technol- ogy, which is about ten times smaller than the wavelength of an incident photon (about 25 µm) in Ref. [27].
Therefore, lim- ited by the size of the TBG samples, it is difﬁcult to compare the theoretical results of Bascones et al. with the experimental measurements in the short term.
In this paper, we calculate the conductivity spectrum of TBG in the energy region from 0 to *Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11874271 and 11874272).

Thus, our cal- culation results show the optical conductivity with higher in- cident energy (narrower incident wavelength), which can pro- vide some reliable information for the experimental measure- ment of real TBG samples with small twist angle.
Here, we study the low-energy band structure of TBGs at a series of small rotation angles θ around the magic angle based on an effective continuum model.
The optical conduc- tivity spectra are calculated based on the Kubo formula.
At such small angles, the lattice structure of TBG spontaneously relaxes to minimize the energy of the structure, leading to a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation in band structures.
The dependence of different peaks in the optical conductivity spectrum on the rotation angle θ and lattice relaxation effect is fully explored.
We study in detail how the van Hove singularities in DOS are related to different interband transitions.
Our results show that optical measurements are essential for studying the band struc- ture and lattice reconstruction in TBG.
2. Theoretical model A TBG superlattice is illustrated in Fig. 1.
When the rel- ative twist angle θ of the two graphene monolayers is close to the magic angle, the period of moir´e superlattice is much larger than the lattice constant of graphene a ≈0.246 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(a), so an effective continuum model[26,28,29] can be used to describe the electronic band structure of TBG.
Here we consider the TBG structure formed by the ﬁrst and second layers of AA-stacked bilayer graphene, which rotate around the typical B atom by −θ/2 and +θ/2, respectively.
Then, the lattice constant of the moir´e superlattice is LM = a 2sin(θ/2).
Figure 1(b) shows the Brillouin zone of small angle TBGs.
The large hexagons in red and blue represent the ﬁrst Bril- louin zones of layers 1 and 2, respectively.
𝐾l and 𝐾′ l denote the two inequivalent valleys of layer l (l = 1,2 corresponds to layers 1 and 2, respectively).
The difference between the two 𝐾(𝐾′) wavevectors results in the mini Brillouin zone (shown as a small black hexagon), which is generated from the recip- rocal lattice of the moir´e superlattice.
𝐾s, 𝐾′ s, 𝑀s, and 𝛤s correspond to points in the mini Brillouin zone.[30] The effective continuum model is constructed from a con- tinuum electronic description of massless Dirac fermions in the two graphene layers that are coupled by a slowly chang- ing periodic inter-layer hopping.[6] The states near 𝐾valley and those near 𝐾′ valley are far apart in the wave space when θ is small, so the coupling between different valleys can be ignored.
Near the 𝐾(𝐾′) valley, the effective low energy Hamiltonian includes the intra-layer Hamiltonian Hl of layer l and the inter-layer coupling term U.
The continuum model can be written in a 4×4 matrix as Heff =  H1 U† U H2  , (1) with Hl = −hvF/a(𝑘−𝐾ξ,l)·𝜎, (2) U =  u u′ u′ u  +  u u′ω−ξ u′ωξ u  e iξ𝐺M 1 𝑟 +  u u′ωξ u′ω−ξ u  e iξ(𝐺M 1 +𝐺M 2 )𝑟, (3) in the Hl term, vF is the band velocity of the Dirac cone, h is the Planck constant, we take hvF/a = 2.1354 eV,[26] 𝜎is the Pauli matrices, 𝑘is the two-dimensional Bloch wave vector, taken value from the moir´e Brillouin zone, ξ = ±1 labels the 𝐾and 𝐾′ valleys, and 𝐾ξ,l denotes the location of the Dirac cone.
In the U term, ω = ei2π/3, 𝐺M l is the reciprocal lattice vectors for the moir´e superlattice, 𝑟is measured from the cen- ter of rotation in real space, u and u′ are terms that describe the interlayer coupling. (b) θ Γ Γs (a) .

The moir´e wavelength is LM = a 2sin(θ/2), where a = 0.246 nm is the lattice con- stant of graphene and θ is the rotation angle.
(b) The moir´e Brillouin zone (small black hexagon) is constructed from the difference between the two 𝐾(𝐾′) wavevectors for the two layers (red hexagon: layer 1, blue hexagon: layer 2).
𝐾s, 𝐾′ s, 𝑀s, and 𝛤s are points in the moir´e Brillouin zone.
For unrelaxed TBG systems where the two graphene lay- ers are rigidly rotated relative to each other, the atomic reg- istry changes continuously within the moir´e period between four different stacking conﬁgurations AA, AB, BA, and sad- dle point (SP), as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
For this case, one 017303-2Chin. Phys.
B Vol. 30, No. 1 (2021) 017303 can use u = u′ = 110 meV[5] in the continuum model.
In prac- tice, however, in the small-twist regime, the competition be- tween the van der Waals interlayer interaction and the elastic energy at the interface can lead to a signiﬁcant relaxation of the lattice structure to reduce the area of the AA region with high stacking energy.[31–37] The relaxed lattice forms an array of triangular domains with alternating AB- and BA-stacking regions.[38,39] Moreover, the lattice relaxation causes corru- gation in the out-of-plane direction with increased vertical separation between the AA regions compared to that in AB regions.[31] The effects of the lattice relaxation can be taken into account by using u = 0.0797 eV and u′ = 0.0975 eV[29] in the effective continuum model, as shown previously.
Using the eigen-wave functions obtained from the effec- tive continuum model, Eq. (1), the optical conductivity σ(ω) of TBG can be calculated by the Kubo formula σ(ω) = e2¯h iS ∑ m,n f(Em)−f(En) Em −En |⟨am|vx |an⟩|2 ¯hω + iη −En +Em , (4) where e represents the elementary charge, ¯h is the reduced Planck constant, S is the area of the system in real space, f(E) is the Fermi distribution function, Em (En) and |am⟩(|an⟩are the eigenenergy and eigenstate of the system obtained by solv- ing the Hamiltonian, vx represents the velocity operator, η is the phenomenological broadening, which is 0.003 eV,[26] and ¯hω is the incident photon energy.
3. Results and discussion Based on the effective continuum model described above, we calculate the electronic band structure of relaxed (black solid lines) and unrelaxed (red dashed lines) TBGs at three ro- tation angles θ (1.05∘, 1.10∘, and 1.16∘, respectively) close to the magic angle, as shown in Fig. 2.
Here, the path of band structures is along the line 𝐾s–𝛤s–𝑀s–𝐾′ s in the moir´e Bril- louin zone scheme, and the origin of the band energy axis (the band energy E = 0 eV) is set to the charge neutral point.
Re- gardless of lattice reconstruction, a set of ﬂat bands appears at the Dirac point due to the competition between the kinetic energy and the interlayer hybridization energy.
For unrecon- structed TBG, the ﬂat bands are conﬁned to within about 15 meV, and the bandwidth decreases with the increase of twist angle θ.
However, under the inﬂuence of lattice relaxation, the ﬂat bands near the Dirac point are obviously gapped from the high energy bands in both the electron side and the hole side.
The size of such gaps is dependent on the twist angle θ, which appears to be minimum (about 10 meV) at θ = 1.05∘among the three rotation angels (Fig. 2(a)).
In addition, the lattice re- construction also has a great inﬂuence on the band velocity in the ﬂat bands.
The lowest energy bands at the Dirac point in the reconstructed TBGs are signiﬁcantly ﬂattened compared to the unrelaxed TBGs at the same angle.

The path of band structures is along the line 𝐾s–𝛤s–𝑀s–𝐾′ s in the moir´e Brillouin zone scheme, and the Dirac point energy is set to 0 eV. In Fig. 3, we plot the optical conductivity σ(ω) of TBGs at various rotation angles in a wide frequency range, when the temperature is close to 0 K. The red dashed line and black solid line represent the conductivity of the unreconstructed and reconstructed TBGs, respectively.
The conductivity is plot- ted in units of σmono = gvgs 16 e2 ¯h , which is the dynamical con- ductivity of monolayer graphene, and the spin and valley de- generacies are gs = gv = 2, respectively.[40,41] As shown in 017303-3Chin. Phys.
B Vol. 30, No. 1 (2021) 017303 Figs. 3(a)–3(c), the conductivity spectrum exhibits a series of characteristic peaks, mainly including the ﬁrst group of peaks around 0.1 eV and the second group of peaks in the frequency range from 0.2 eV to 0.4 eV. The peak structure almost sys- tematically evolves with the rotation angle θ.
When the effect of lattice relaxation is taken into account, the ﬁrst group of peaks move to higher energies, and the peaks in the second group also shift signiﬁcantly compared to those in the unre- constructed TBG system.
The ﬁrst peak in σ (ω) of the recon- structed TBGs corresponds to the interband transition from the ﬂat band to the higher band, which can provide an effective experimental way to determine the gap between the ﬂat bands and other bands under lattice relaxation.
These gaps are very important for understanding the novel transport properties of magic-angle TBG.
Therefore, experimental measurements of the optical conductivity of TBG can provide insights into the lattice relaxation effects in this system.

The black solid line (red dashed line) represents the energy bands of the 𝐾(𝐾′) valleys in Fig. 4(a).
In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), each characteristic saddle point of the band structure is correspond- ing to a van Hove singularity in the DOS.
The sharp peaks in the optical conductivity spectrum (Fig. 4(c)) are associated with optical transitions involving the van Hove singularities in the DOS (Fig. 4(b)).
For instance, a peak numbered 1○near E = 0.02 eV in Fig. 4(c) corresponds to the interband transi- tion from the highest valence band to the second conduction band, as indicated by the magenta arrow in Fig. 4(a).
More- over, the major peaks labeled 1○– 7○in the optical conductiv- ity in Fig. 4(c) can be assigned to transitions between different bands labeled by arrows in Fig. 4(a).
There are also unmarked interband transitions from the other valence bands to the ﬂat band in Fig. 4(a), which are similar to the transitions indicated by red arrows due to the electron-hole symmetry in the effec- tive continuum model.

Figure 5(a) shows the optical conductivity of TBG with rotation angle θ = 1.05∘, in the presence of lattice relaxation, for different values of the electronic ﬁlling.
Figure 5(b) is the enlarged plot of the energy region from 0 to 0.1 eV in Fig. 5(a).
The black solid line and red dashed line represent the conduc- tivity for the Fermi energy level at the charge neutrality point (CNP) and full (or empty) ﬂat bands, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 5(a), at high energies, the peak energies are similar for different values of the electronic ﬁlling in the conductivity spectra.
Remarkably, in Fig. 5(b), the ﬁrst group of peaks for the full (or empty) ﬂat bands move signiﬁcantly towards lower energies, and at the same time, the Drude peak at zero fre- quency disappears compared to the chemical potential of the undoped system µCNP.
Next, to fully understand the depen- dence of the optical conductivity on rotation angle θ, we also calculate the conductivity of the relaxed TBG with rotation 017303-4Chin. Phys.

Figure 5(c) shows that the peak energies evolve systematically with the twist an- gle θ, so they can be used as ﬁngerprints to identify the twist angle.
Especially, for the conductivity of TBG with θ = 0.80∘, the ﬁrst group of peaks degenerate into only one strong peak compared to that of TBGs with other larger twist angles.

4. Conclusion We have theoretically studied the electronic band struc- ture and optical conductivity spectrum of TBGs at various ro- tation angles in the vicinity of magic angle, and explored the effects of lattice relaxation.
We have shown that a series of characteristic peaks in the conductivity spectrum is related to the van Hove singularities in the DOS, which enables us to ex- tract a lot of important information about interband transitions and band structure.
When lattice relaxation effects exist, the gaps between the ﬂat bands and other bands in magic-angle TBG can be quantitatively studied according to the lowest en- ergy peak in the conductivity spectrum by optical measure- ments.
Such gaps are very important for understanding the novel transport properties of magic-angle TBG.
In addition, the peaks in the conductivity spectrum shift signiﬁcantly un- der the effect of lattice reconstruction.
Our study paves the way for exploring the physics of TBG with optical techniques.
