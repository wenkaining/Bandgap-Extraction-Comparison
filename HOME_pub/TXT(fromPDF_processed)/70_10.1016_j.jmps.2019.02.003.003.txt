Abstract  Nanoindentation is a convenient method to investigate the mechanical properties  of materials on small scales by utilizing low loads and small indentation depths.
However, the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) on the nanoindentation response  remains unclear and needs to be studied by investigating in detail the interactions  between dislocations and GBs during nanoindentation.
In the present work, we  employ a three-dimensional multiscale modeling framework, which couples  three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) with the Finite Element  method (FEM) to investigate GB effects on the nanoindentation behavior of an  aluminum bicrystal.
The interaction between dislocations and GB is physically  modeled in terms of a penetrable GB, where piled-up dislocations can penetrate  through the GB and dislocation debris at GBs can emit full dislocations into grains.
In  the simulation, we confirmed two experimentally observed phenomena, namely,  pop-in events and the dependence of indentation hardness on the distance from GB.
Two pop-in events were observed, of which the initial pop-in event is correlated with  the activation and multiplication of dislocations, while the GB pop-in event results  from dislocation transmission through the GB.
By changing the distance between theACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3    indenter and GB, the simulation shows that the indentation hardness increases with  decreasing GB-indenter distance.
A quantitative model has been formulated which  relates the dependency of indentation hardness on indentation depth and on  GB-indenter distance to the back stress created by piled-up geometrically necessary  dislocations in the plastic zone and to the additional constraint imposed by the GB on  the plastic zone size.

Introduction  With the rapid development of nano-technology, the mechanical behavior of  materials on micro and nano scales has become an important subject of scientific  investigation, and differences between micro-scale and macroscopic mechanical  properties have received increasing attention (Greer and Hosson, 2011; Javaid et al.,  2017; Kiener et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2018).
Indentation testing is one of the most  convenient methods to investigate the mechanical response of materials on micro and  nano scales because of its comparative simplicity, the possibility to probe material  microstructures in small volumes near the surface of any bulk sample, and its  capabilities in testing thin films where tensile experiments are difficult to perform  (Oliver and Pharr, 1992).
In polycrystalline metals consisting of many grains that are separated by grain  boundaries (GBs), plastic deformation is mainly mediated by dislocation glide.
Therefore, dislocation microstructure evolution and the interaction between  dislocations and GBs play a significant role in controlling the strength and  deformation properties of metal polycrystals.
The GB-dislocation interaction  mechanisms are most conveniently investigated by studying bicrystals, where the  existence of only one GB simplifies the problem to a significant extent (Aifantis and  Ngan, 2007; Fan et al., 2012; Kirchlechner et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015; Soer, 2006;  Soer et al., 2005; Voyiadjis and Zhang, 2015; Zhang and Voyiadjis, 2016).
Soer (2006)  conducted nanoindentation experiments on Fe-Si bicrystals and Mo bicrystals, andACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4    observed that the load-depth curves were punctuated by two displacement jumps  (“pop-in events”) which they interpreted as respective signatures of grain interior  yielding and of dislocation transmission through the GB.
Theoretically, these authors  used a gradient plasticity framework in conjunction with a Hall-Petch approach to  analyze the deformation curves and to establish criteria for slip transmission across  GBs (Soer et al., 2005).
Zhang and Voyiadjis (2016) carried out nanoindentation on  copper bicrystals and found that the hardness first increases and then decreases with  increasing indentation depth.
They pointed out that this phenomenon is related to the  interaction between dislocations and GB.
Due to the resistance of the GB to  dislocation motion, dislocations accumulating in front of the GB cause a back stress in  the grain interior, so that a kinematic hardening effect can be observed.
However, as  the indentation depth increases, the accumulated dislocations penetrate through the  GB once the resolved shear stress acting on the dislocations exceeds a critical value  and then expand freely in the adjacent grain, leading to softening.
Conversely, the  nanoindentation experiments on polycrystalline Ni3Al and niobium conducted by the  group of Ngan (Wang and Ngan, 2004; Wo and Ngan, 2004) indicate that, for  GB-indenter distances above about 2 micrometres, the GB has little influences on  hardness.
From the aforementioned experimental results, it can be clearly seen that the  role of GBs in the mechanical response of crystalline materials under indentation is  complex and not yet completely understood.
In nanoindentation experiments, various techniques have been used to  characterize the dislocation configuration around the indented area, such as  Transmission Electron Microscopy (Chiu and Ngan, 2002; Fivel et al., 1998) and  newly-developed Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging under controlled diffraction  conditions (Zhang et al., 2015).
However, it is still difficult to quantitatively analyze  the dislocation distribution or to monitor its evolution during deformation in situ.
Therefore, numerical simulation remains an excellent tool to investigate those aspects  of plasticity during nanoindentation that cannot be directly accessed by experiment,  and to interpret easily accessible experimental information (such as load displacement  curves) in terms of microstructural mechanisms.
Currently, the crystal plasticity finiteACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5    element method (CPFEM) and molecular dynamics are the main tools used for  nanoindentation simulations.
Li et al. (2013) performed CPFEM simulations to  investigate the effects of grain orientation and grain geometry on the indentation  response of a polycrystalline 2024 aluminum alloy.
The simulation results showed  that stress and misorientation distributions are continuous across low angle GBs,  while high angle GBs act as strong barriers for plastic slip and lead to stress  concentration at the GBs.
Liu et al. (2015) reported that the indentation responses of  copper single crystals and copper bicrystals in CPFEM simulations were almost  identical.
This illustrates an important limitation of the above-mentioned crystal  plasticity models, which only considered the different crystallographic orientations in  different grains but not the different processes which govern plasticity in the bulk and  near GBs on the microstructure level.
Thus, the most important effects of GBs on the  indentation response of materials could not be captured, and therefore, a different  modelling approach, which adequately accounts for the relevant physical processes at  and near GBs, is required.
Compared with CPFEM simulation, DDD simulation has  great advantages in this respect since it provides complete information regarding the  evolution of dislocation microstructures and thus can account for differences between  dislocation behavior in the bulk and near GBs.
Because DDD simulations of  nanoindentation need to deal with inherently nonlinear contact problems associated  with the evolving substrate-indenter contact, simulation schemes must be used that are  capable of dealing with general boundary conditions.
Indentation size effects and  influences of indenter shape were investigated by two-dimensional DDD simulations  on single crystals (Widjaja et al., 2007a; Widjaja et al., 2006), by using the method  introduced by Van der Giessen and Needleman (1995) which couples DDD with FEM  to evaluate dislocation interactions in terms of surface-corrected infinite-body  dislocation stress fields.
Two-dimensional DDD simulations on polycrystals also  captured the effects of grain size and indentation depth on indentation response  (Ouyang et al., 2008; Widjaja et al., 2007b).
The first three-dimensional (3D) DDD  simulation of nanoindentation was conducted by Fivel et al. (1998).
They used a DDD  model with coarse-grained dislocation cores, which they coupled with FEM in orderACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6    to handle the contact boundary value problem and study the plastic zone of  indentation.
Recently, Hu et al. (2017) used similar methodology to investigate the  correlation of incipient plasticity with dislocation nucleation and multiplication during  indentation.
Po et al. (2014) used a scheme that couples DDD with the boundary  element method to simulate nanoindentation of copper single crystals, and studied the  effect of indenter shape on indentation hardness and dislocation structure.
However,  to the best knowledge of the authors, few studies have so far investigated the effect of  GB on nanoindentation by using 3D DDD, which requires the introduction of an  adequate GB model into the 3D DDD framework.
Therefore, our focus is on the  simulation of bicrystal nanoindentation, using a framework which couples FEM and  3D DDD with a penetrable GB model.
The simulation aims at revealing the  characteristics of dislocation evolution and the mechanisms of GB-dislocation  interaction during nanoindentation, in order to better understand the effects of  GB-dislocation interaction on the mechanical response of polycrystalline materials in  general.
This paper is organized as follows.
First, the multiscale discrete dislocation  plasticity model and GB model are briefly described.
Second, indentation simulations  on bicrystal events are performed to analyze the initial pop-in event, GB pop-in event  and the variation of hardness versus distance to GB.
Then, we use the simulation data  to construct a phenomenological model using a Hall-Petch type relation in  conjunction with the spatio-temporal evolution of geometrically necessary dislocation  density to analyze the GB hardening effect in terms of a pile-up model.
In conclusion,  the main findings are summarized. 2.
Multiscale dislocation dynamics framework and GB model   DDD allows to analyze plastic deformation mechanisms during nanoindentation  by tracking the evolution of the dislocation microstructure.
However, DDD was  originally developed as a bulk simulation method and encountered challenges when  dealing with complex boundary conditions.
This poses particular problems in  nanoindentation simulations because of the inherently nonlinear contact problem.
OnACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7    the other hand, FEM is a convenient simulation method to solve complicated  boundary conditions.
Therefore, a hybrid (multiscale) model that couples DDD with  FEM is the method of choice (Chang et al., 2010; El-Awady et al., 2008; Fivel et al.,  1998).
In this work, the 3D discrete-continuous model (DCM) initially developed by  Zbib and de la Rubia (2002), Zbib et al. (1998), and improved by Jamond et al. (2016)  and Huang et al. (2017) is used.
This model has several advantages (Huang et al.,  2017).
The elastic-plastic problem is treated in a multiscale framework where the  (discontinuous) plastic strain obtained from the DDD simulation is coarse grained to  yield smoothly varying stress and plastic strain fields on the FEM scale.
At the same  time, in the DDD simulation, the thus evaluated coarse-grained FEM stress fields are  corrected to account for the high stress fields close to the dislocation lines and thus to  correctly represent the interaction of nearby dislocations, which is underestimated in  traditional DCM approaches (Lemarchand et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2009; Vattré et al.,  2014; Zbib and de la Rubia, 2002; Zbib et al., 1998).
In this work, use the DCM  framework described in Ref.
(Huang et al., 2017) which we generalize, in order to  investigate GB effects in the indentation responses of bicrystals, by introducing a 3D  penetrable GB model into the DDD calculations. 2.1.
Basic idea of multiscale coupling in DCM  The basic idea of multiscale DCM as introduced in (Huang et al., 2017; Jamond  et al., 2016) can be summarized as follows: in 3D DDD, the stress field exerted by the  dislocation ensemble on a segment n is normally represented as a sum over segment  stress fields,     s ( ) ( , , ) n i i n i i n     σ r σ b t r r ,   (1)  where the segment stress fields  s( , , ) i i i  σ b t r r  depend on the segment Burgers  vectors  ib  and tangent vectors  it .
The segment stress fields are highly singular: they  decay like  2 1/ r .
This implies that they exhibit two singularities, one at zero – which  renders the time integration of the interactions of nearby dislocations computationallyACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8    very expensive – and one on the infinite boundary – which makes the summation over  the stresses of distant segments computationally expensive since it is not a priori  possible to truncate.
Multiscale DCM resolves this problem by introducing a coarse grained stress  field  ( ) a σ r .
This represents the stress field of a coarse grained dislocation system  where, by means of a coarse graining function  ( ) a w r , the Burgers vector of each  dislocation segment has been distributed isotropically over a region with radius of the  order of a around the centerpoint of the segment.
(For generalization to anisotropic  coarse graining schemes see Huang et al., 2017) The coarse grained stress field  correctly captures the structure of the dislocation stress field on scales much larger  than a, but due to the coarse graining it misses the high stresses near the dislocation  line singularities and therefore cannot correctly describe the interactions of nearby  dislocations.
The true stress field can, however, be represented without approximation  as the sum of the coarse grained stress field  ( ) a σ r  which describes long-range  interactions, and the residual stress field  SR( ): ( ) ( ) a   σ r σ r σ r  which accounts for  short-range interactions.
The point of this decomposition is that the contribution  ( ) a σ r  can be evaluated in two different manners:   (i) In evaluating  SR( ) σ r , one uses a particular functional form for the coarse  graining function proposed by Cai et al. (2006) that allows to compute the stress  ( ) a n σ r  on a segment n as a sum of coarse grained segment stress fields  s( , , , ) a i i n i a  σ b t r r  that can be evaluated analytically (for explicit expressions see  Cai et al., 2006), such that one can write    s SR SR ( ) ( , , ) ( , , ) ( , , , ) s s n i i n i i i n i a i i n i i n i n a               σ r σ b t r r σ b t r r σ b t r r .
(2)ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9    An important benefit of this procedure is that, as shown by Cai et al. (2006), the  difference  s SR( , , ) i i n i  σ b t r r  of the singular and the coarse-grained stress field of a  segment is a short-ranged function that decreases rapidly for  n i a  r r .
Therefore,  one may restrict, in Eq. (2), the summation to a finite domain.
In the present work we  take this domain to be a sphere Sn of radius 2a around rn.
With this choice we follow  the work of Jamond et al. (2016) who demonstrated that such a remarkably short  cut-off still provides a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and  numerical accuracy.
The resulting situation is depicted schematically in Fig.1, right.     Fig. 1.
Schematic illustration: (left) sphere Sn in which the incremental plastic strain caused by slip  of segment n is coarse grained according to  ( ) a w r  for use as eigenstrain in the FEM stress  calculation, (right) calculation of the stress at the middle point of dislocation segment n by adding  the short-ranged stresses of segments within Sn (blue segments) to the FEM stress, after (Huang et  al., 2017).
(ii) For evaluating the long-range stress interactions which are described by the  field  ( ) a σ r  alone, a different procedure is required.
Direct summation over segment  stress fields would run into the difficulty that  ( ) a σ r  decays slowly like  2 1/ r   (hence, the summation would need to be done over all segments in the simulation)  and is furthermore influenced by boundary conditions, such that for general boundary  conditions an analytical expression for the long-ranged part is not available.
Instead,  one uses the fact that the calculation of any dislocation stress field can also be  envisaged as the solution of an eigenstrain problem.
The differential eigenstrainACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10    created by a dislocation segment n of Burgers vector bn sweeping an area dA on its  slip plane with normal nn is given by    p d d ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 n n n n n A        r n b b n r r ,   (3) the overall incremental eigenstrain is obtained by summation over all segments, and  the overall eigenstrain is obtained by summation of the incremental eigenstrains over  all time steps.
We now define a coarse-grained eigenstrain where we spread the  Burgers vector of the dislocation, using the same coarse graining function  ( ) a w r  as  used for direct evaluation of  ( ) a σ r .
Furthermore, we restrict the evaluation of the  coarse grained eigenstrain to the sphere Sn, which ensures both numerical efficiency  and conceptual consistency of the coarse graining procedure.
Thus we evaluate the  coarse grained eigenstrain created by a segment sweeping the area dA as    p d d ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 n a n n n n n S n A N w         r n b b n r r r r ,   (4)  where the function  ( ) n S  r  is one if r is contained within Sn and zero otherwise (Fig.  1, left).
The normalization factor N where  1 3 ( ) Sn N w d r  r  ensures that the  volume integrals of the coarse grained and the original eigenstrain coincide (Huang et  al., 2017).
Again, the overall coarse grained eigenstrain is obtained by summation of  the differential eigenstrains over all segments and time steps.
Finally, the thus  evaluated eigenstrain is used to determine, using standard Finite Element  methodology, the coarse-grained stress field  ( ) a σ r  in a manner that accounts  naturally for the imposed boundary tractions and/or displacements.
(iii) The delineated methodology has one important limitation.
We evaluate the  overall stress field as  SR ( ) ( ) ( ) a   σ r σ r σ r  and perform, for the short-range stress  field, a summation over segment stress fields as given in Eq. (2), using expressions  valid in the bulk which do not account for surface effects.
The coarse-grained stress  field  ( ) a σ r , on the other hand, accounts for boundary effects but only within theACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11    limited spatial resolution that is imposed by the FEM grid and by the coarse graining  procedure for the plastic strain field: as demonstrated by Huang et al. (2017), if the  grid size is smaller than a, then the of image forces near a flat surface diverges from  the exact solution on scales less than about 2a: within a layer of about two coarse  graining lengths around surfaces or interfaces, there is a mismatch between the  long-range and short-range dislocation stress fields.
In particular, the singular  correction to the stress field of a dislocation that is threading a surface or interface is  not accounted for by the short-range field, and seriously under-sampled by the  coarse-grained FEM.
An elegant solution to this problem, which we may implement  in future work, is to replace in Eq. (2) the segment stress fields by surface-corrected  segment stress fields and their coarse-grained counterparts.
Analytical expressions for  such stress fields can be derived from the work of Yuan et al. (2013, 2016) who  provide analytical expressions for the stress fields of dislocations near bimaterial  interfaces which, if implemented in DCM, would restore the match between  long-range and short-range fields even in the near surface/interface region. 2.2.
DDD-FEM coupling: technical aspects  The present DCM model contains two modules, i.e. the DDD and FEM.
The  DDD module handles the dynamical evolution of dislocations and calculates the  resulting plastic strain, which is then coarse grained and distributed on the Gauss  integration points (GIPs) of the FEM mesh.
In the FEM module, we treat the plastic  strain  p aε  transferred from the DDD module and the stress  0 σ  induced by initial  dislocations as the eigenstrain and pre-stress field, respectively.
The stress state of  GIPs is described through the constitutive model,    GIP p 0 ( ) a a    σ C ε ε σ ,   (5)  where C  is the elastic stiffness matrix.
The displacement, strain and stress of any  given point in the sample are then determined by solving the boundary-value problem  in commercial FEM software Ansys®.
Finally, the thus evaluated stress field is  interpolated back to the segment centerpoints asACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12       FE node ( ) n n i i n N  σ r σ r ,   (6)  where  node iσ  are the FEM stresses at the nodes located in the same element as the  evaluated dislocation segment midpoint  nr , i N  is the interpolation function of the  adopted finite element.
For a hexahedral element as used in our nanoindentation  simulation,  i N  is defined as        1 1 1 1 8 i i i i N             1, 2, , 8 i   ,   (7)  where  , , i i i  are the local coordinate of the nodes in the element, and  , ,  are  the local coordinates of the dislocation segment midpoint, as shown in Fig. 2.
The  local coordinate ( , , ) is related to the global coordinate (x, y, z) as      2 / O x x x l   ,    2 / O y y y l   ,    2 / O z z z l   ,     (8)  where  , , O O O x y z  are the global coordinate of the element center, and  , , x y z l l l  are  the element sizes in three dirctions, see Fig. 2.      Fig. 2.

Finally, the total stress which drives dislocation motion is obtained by adding the  short-range stress     FE SR, ( ) ( ) n n n n i n i i n S      σ σ r σ r r .
(9) This expression represents the segment stresses.
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13    Finally, we make a line-tension correction  LT n F to correctly represent the  interaction of adjacent segments of the same line, and thus we obtain the total force on  the dislocation as    tot PK LT LT ( ) n n n n n n n       F F F σ b t F ,  (10)  where  nt  is the dislocation segment direction.
The velocity of the dislocation is  determined from this force assuming a linear mobility law:    tot v B  F m ,  (11)  where 𝒎= 𝒏× 𝒕 is the dislocation glide direction and B is the viscous drag  coefficient, which is taken to be  4 10 Pa s   in this work (Huang et al., 2017).
2.3 Computational efficiency of the DCM model  DCM as described here is, from the point of view of computational efficiency,  superior to standard 3D DDD when it comes to simulating large systems with general  boundary conditions.
The use of FEM to evaluate the long-range dislocation stress  fields makes it not only possible to handle general boundary conditions.
It also allows  to truncate the summation over segment stress fields, thus reducing the computational  cost of evaluating segment-segment interactions to order N while still being able to  use simple analytical expressions in the summation.
At the same time, the fact that we  use coarse grained eigenstrains in the FEM calculations results in a slow  spatio-temporal variation of the FEM stress as compared to the interaction stresses of  nearby dislocations.
Therefore, the FE time step can be increased to up to 40 times the  DDD time step (one FE step per 40 DDD steps) without compromising the accuracy  of the simulations.
The length- and time scale separation between DDD and FEM thus  significantly enhances the computational efficiency of DCM: on the one hand, the  number of time-consuming FE calculations can be restricted, on the other hand, in  DDD the time-consuming summation over the interaction stresses of distant  dislocation segments is avoided since these interactions are accounted for by the FEM  stress field.

GB model In the present work, we adopt a 3D penetrable tilt GB model proposed by Fan et  al.
(2012) to handle the interactions between dislocations and GBs.
In this model, two  GB-dislocation interaction scenarios were considered, namely, dislocation penetration  through GBs and dislocation emission from GBs.
As shown in Fig. 3, two adjacent  grains with misorientation angle  are separated by a symmetric tilt boundary, such  that the slip planes I and II have a common line of intersection with the GB. When      Fig. 3.

approaching the GB, an incoming dislocation segment (colored in blue) with Burgers  vector Ib  and length  pl  on slip plane I in Grain 1 is initially blocked in front of the  GB.
However, if the stress acting on the incoming dislocation segment  Ib  exceeds a  critical stress  CRSS  , the segment is transmitted through the GB from Grain 1 to Grain  2 and becomes a new dislocation segment (marked in red) with Burgers vector  II b   and length  pl  on slip plane II of Grain 2.
In addition, considering the conservation of  Burgers vector, a debris dislocation Δ𝒃= 𝒃I −𝒃II (colored in green) with the same  length  pl  is left on the GB after the transmission event.
Fig. 4 shows a  two-dimensional schematic of the dislocation transmission process in a plane     Fig. 4.

The direction unit vector of the tilt axis is  denoted as t , and the dislocation Burgers vector can be decomposed into a vector  parallel and a vector perpendicular to the tilt axis,  ||    b b b , where the parallel  vector has the length  || || | | b    b b t  and the perpendicular vector  ||b   b b t  has  length b .
The magnitude of the dislocation debris Burgers vector can then be easily  determined from the figure as    II 2 sin 2 b b          .
(12) The critical resolved shear stress  CRSS   can be calculated from the energy  conservation law as    2 2 CRSS I gb I ( ) b E b G b      ,  (13)  where the first term on the right-hand side represents the energy increase of the grain  boundary with  gb E  being the GB energy density.
The term  2 ( ) G b    represents the  elastic energy associated with the GB ledge caused by the dislocation debris left on  the grain boundary, with  being a non-dimensional constant accounting for the  atomistic configuration of the dislocation debris and G the shear modulus.
According  to Hasson et al.’s measurements (Hasson and Goux, 1971), the GB energy density Egb  in Eq. (13) is almost a constant when 𝜃∈(𝜃1, 𝜃2], while for  close to0° and 90°,  Egb changes linearly with .
Therefore, Egb can be approximately expressed by the  following equation (Hasson and Goux, 1971):    1 1 gb 1 2 2 2 / 0 (90 ) / (90 ) 90 k E k k                        ,   (14)  where the parameters kare 600 mJ/m220°70°, respectively, as used in Ref.
(Hasson and Goux, 1971).
In the present paper, the misorientation angle  is set as 5°.
Therefore, Egb can be expressed as    gb 1 / E k  .

With increasing number of dislocation penetration events, the energy of the  dislocation debris on the GB also increases and a mechanism to release the  corresponding energy is needed.
It has been experimentally confirmed that steps and  ledges on GBs are important nucleation sites for dislocations (Li et al., 2009).

After the emission event, the Burgers vector of new  dislocation debris on GB becomes b  with length  el .
Similar to the penetration  event, the conservation of Burgers vector must be satisfied, i.e., Δ𝑩= Δ𝒃̃ + 𝒃𝑒.

Simulation setup  The FEM indentation model (generated by Ansys®) is shown in Fig. 6(a).
We  simulate indentation with a Berkovich-type diamond indenter with a half-angle of  65.3 .
Since the elastic modulus of the indenter is much higher than that of the  indented material, the indenter is in the simulation modeled as a rigid body.
One side  of the indenter is assumed to run parallel to the intersection line of GB plane and  indented surface, as shown in Fig. 6(a).
The dimensions of the indented sample in X,  Y and Z directions are lx=1400b, ly=1200b and lz=600b, respectively, where b is the  magnitude of Burgers vector and chosen as 0.25 nm in this paper.
Furthermore, the  height of the indented sample is set to be ten times larger than the maximum  indentation depth of 44b, such as to make the indentation response approximately  independent of model size (Peggs and Leigh, 1983).
20-node hexahedral elements  (SOLID 186 in ANSYS) were used to improve the accuracy of the FE calculation.
As  the nanoindentation simulation involves a contact problem and the contact area  between indenter and indented material is relatively small, the FE mesh underneath  the indented region was refined (see Fig. 6(a)).
All FE nodes on the bottom surface of  the sample are completely constrained, while the four surrounding surfaces are free.
The displacement of the indenter along the Z direction is increased at a fixed rate.
Contact between indenter and sample is assumed rigid.

To model dislocation nucleation underneath the indenter, we  create 120 dislocation segments with pinned endpoints (10 segments per slip system),  and place them at random locations within a thin layer underneath the specimen  surface with 𝑋∈[−500𝑏, 500𝑏], 𝑌∈[−400𝑏, 400𝑏] and 𝑍∈[100𝑏, 300𝑏] as  shown in Fig. 6(b).
The segment orientations are random with uniform distribution  within the respective slip planes.
The segment lengths, which determine the critical  stresses for dislocation nucleation, are chosen in such a manner that the hardness  values obtained from our simulations match those obtained in large scale MD  simulations of indentation in absence of bulk dislocation sources (Voyiadjis and  Yaghoobi, 2015).
We use a uniform distribution of lengths between 80b and 100b,  which results for an indentation depth of 40b in typical hardness values  0.2 0.25 G H G    (where G is the shear modulus of the indented material), in  agreement with our reference simulations (Voyiadjis and Yaghoobi, 2015).

Pop-in event  During nanoindentation, discontinuities on the load-depth curves can be observed,  which are related to the first activation and multiplication of dislocations under the  indenter tip.
These events indicate the transition from elastic to elasto-plastic response  of the indented material.
In the load-controlled loading mode, the load-depth curves  display a displacement excursion known as initial “pop-in” phenomenon, whereas an  abrupt load drop is observed in the case of displacement-controlled loading (Zhang  and Aifantis, 2010, 2011).
In order to avoid artefacts due to the stochastic nature of  the plastic response in dislocation dynamics simulations and to ensure that observed  pop-in like features constitute generic characteristics of indentation behavior rather  than mere fluctuations, three simulations with a distance from indenter to GB of 50b  were conducted.
These three simulations used different initial dislocation  configurations but the same initial dislocation density and average dislocation length.
Pop-in events were observed in all three cases, as shown in Fig. 7, where it can be  seen that the pop-in events on the load-depth curves (Figs. 7g, 7h and 7i) all appear at  the first dislocation activation (Figs. 7d, 7e and 7f).
This indicates that the initial  pop-in is associated with the activation of dislocation sources and the subsequent  dislocation multiplication (Chiu and Ngan, 2002; Lorenz et al., 2003), as observed in  previous experiments (Bei et al., 2008; Lorenz et al., 2003).
It should be pointed out  that although the indentation loading was realized in displacement- controlled mode,  the load-depth curves show a pop-in phenomenon rather than a sudden load drop.
The  absence of a load drop probably results from the low data output frequency.
In the  simulation framework, the simulation results are exported every 40 steps, thus some  significant data points may be neglected.

The position of the indenter is schematically marked  with a pink dotted triangle.
Besides the initial pop-in event resulting from the first activation of dislocations,  a displacement burst known as GB pop-in can also be observed when dislocations  penetrate through GBs.
Fig. 8 shows the dislocation structure before and after such a  penetration event, and the corresponding load-depth curve, again with a GB-indenter  distance of 50b.
As shown in Fig. 8(a), a large number of dislocations accumulate in  front of the GB, which suppresses the further movement of dislocations during  loading.
However, as the indentation depth and the stress acting on the GB gradually  increase, the dislocations are transmitted through the GB and leave dislocation debris  (red lines in Fig. 8(b)) on the GB once the resolved shear stress acting on a trapped  dislocation reaches the critical value for dislocation transmission.

As shown in Fig. 8(c), at the moment of dislocation transmission through the GB,  a GB pop-in phenomenon appears on the load-depth curve due to the sudden release  of stress underneath the indenter.
In nanoindentation experiments, similar pop-in  events on the load-depth curves have been observed when a sufficient number of  dislocations simultaneously penetrate through a GB (Wang and Ngan, 2004; Soer et  al., 2005), which qualitatively agrees with our simulation results.
Similar to the initial  pop-in event, the GB pop-in events obtained from simulations are not as pronounced  as in experiment, since the number of dislocations simultaneously transmitted and the  dimension of the simulated model are much smaller than in typical experiments.
Besides the pop-in phenomena coming from the transition from elastic  deformation to elasto-plastic deformation and from dislocation transmission through  GB, the intermittent operation and multiplication of dislocation sources can also  induce subsequent pop-in events or fluctuation phenomena on the load-depth curve, as  shown in Fig. 9.
In summary, from the above analysis it can be inferred that the essence of pop-in  phenomena is the motion of a large number of dislocations, which generally occurs at  the moment of initial yield (first dislocation source activation) of the material and at  the moment when dislocations are first transmitted through GB and expand into the  adjacent grain.

GB influence on indentation hardness In order to obtain reliable results, five simulations with different initial  dislocation structures (initial pinned line segments are randomly distributed  underneath the surface, with the segment length statistics and overall dislocation  length being the same) were performed and the resulting load-depth curves were then  averaged to get the final hardness value.
In order to separate the dependence of  indentation hardness on indentation depth from the dependence of indentation  hardness on the distance to GB, two typical indentation depths of 32b and 42b were  chosen to study the GB effect on hardness.
Fig. 10 shows the relationship between  indentation hardness and the distance from indenter to GB at the indentation depths of  32b and 42b.
In this figure, seven different distances d have been evaluated, i.e.,  d=−150b, d=−100b, d=−50b, d=0 (on the GB), d=50b, d=100b and d=150b.
The  hardness of the indented material is defined as 𝐻= 𝑃𝐴 ⁄ , where P is the indentation  load and A is the contact area between indenter and bicrystal.
It can be clearly seen  from Fig. 10 that the hardness increases with decreasing GB-indenter distance,  showing a significant GB hardening effect.
Zhang and Voyiadjis (2016) and Soer et al.  (2005) have performed nanoindentation experiments on a copper bicrystal and a  niobium bicrystal.
Both of their experimental results show the trend of increasingACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 23    hardness with decreasing GB-indenter distance, which is in good qualitative  agreement with our simulated results.    Fig. 10.

Discussion In order to provide a quantitative interpretation of the GB hardening  phenomenon observed in our simulations (Fig. 10), we determine the spatial  distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) underneath the indenter.
We use this information to establish a mathematical model that allows us not only to  evaluate the dependence of hardness on distance to GB and on indentation depth, but  also evaluate the GND density between GB and indenter in quantitative terms.    5.1.
GND distribution  One of the most significant advantages of DDD simulation is that it provides  in-situ information about the evolution of the dislocation structure.
From the discrete  dislocation arrangement, a coarse-grained GND density tensor can be obtained by  using the method proposed by Aifantis et al. (2009).
This method has been adopted byACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 24    Zhang et al. (2014) to investigate how the internal length scale in strain gradient  theory relates to parameters of the dislocation microstructure.
The GND tensor along  the x axis (averaged over the sample y and z directions) can be determined from the  following equation (Zhang et al., 2014):    ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) i i i V x x V x      α I b ,  (18)  where  ( ) V x   is the volume of a slice that is centered at x and oriented  perpendicular to the x axis (i.e. in our simulations: parallel to the GB).
iI  is the line  vector of a dislocation segment i located within the volume  ( ) V x  , and  ib  is the  Burgers vector of the segment.
The symbol “< >” denotes an average over multiple  simulations.
According to Zhang et al. (2014), only two components of the GND  tensor,  23   and  32  , are related to the normal plastic strain gradient along the x axis  which we characterize here in terms of the values of  23   and  32  , averaged over  thin slices across the sample taken parallel to the GB.
Fig. 11 shows contour plots of  this quantity versus the position x and indentation depth h for various GB-indenter  distances.
Let us first discuss, for reference, the behavior expected for indentation of a  sample without GB.
In that case, the  23   and  32   components of the GND tensor  are expected to be zero directly underneath the indenter tip: because of symmetry, this  is a location of maximum plastic strain, where the strain gradient perpendicular to the  indentation direction and accordingly the corresponding GND tensor components  must be zero.
As we pass underneath the indenter, the strain gradient changes sign and  at some distance from the indenter we expect the GND density to reach a maximum,  the position of which indicates the characteristic extension of the plastic zone.
The  GND surrounding the indenter tip create a back stress, which decreases with  increasing extension of the plastic zone and may be fully or partly responsible for the  indentation size effect.
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 25      Fig. 11.
Plots of geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density tensor component  23    versus distance x from GB, for varying indentation depths; the plots represent different distances d  from indenter to GB; the position of the indenter is additionally marked with a black triangle.
We now look at the GND distribution observed during indentation close to a GB  (Fig. 11).
We still find a GND density maximum on the side of the indenter facing  away from the GB, which is little affected by the GB-indenter distance.
On the side  facing the GB, on the other hand, the motion of dislocations is initially constrained to  the region enclosed between indenter and GB, and accordingly the GNDs are shifted  closer to the indenter and their density in the region enclosed between indenter and  GB increases.
The corresponding back stresses delimit dislocation activation  underneath the indenter and thereby increase the flow stress required to maintain  deformation activity within the plastic zone.
At the position of the GB (x=0), the GND  density in all cases reaches a pronounced maximum due to dislocation pile-up.
The  height of this maximum is delimited by the effect of dislocation transmission, which  occurs once the GND piling up against the GB create a critical forward stress  sufficient to induce dislocation transmission.
The overall scenario of dislocation pile  up, dislocation back stresses controlling plastic flow in the active zone, andACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 26    dislocation transmission, is very similar to the scenario envisaged in the classical  pile-up theory of Hall-Petch hardening.
We now proceed to formulate this analogy in  quantitative terms. 5.2.
Theoretical interpretation: modified Hall-Petch effect  To capture the observed GB effect on hardness and the associated GND  distribution in quantitative terms, we first need to point out one essential difference  between the present situation and the situation in a polycrystal.
In polycrystals, a  single characteristic length (the grain size) controls the slip distance of dislocations.
In  our simulations, as in real indentation experiments near GB, this role is shared by the  distance from the indenter to the GB on the one hand, and from the indenter to the  boundary of the plastic zone on the other hand.
We account for this dual dependency by introducing an effective plastic zone  radius via     2 2 2 eff 2 2 ( ) ( , ) 1 2 ( ) A h d R h d d A h             ,  (19)  where η is a fit parameter and  2 ( ) 24.5 A h h   is the projected area underneath the  indenter, which we identify with the cross section of the plastic zone in absence of a  GB.
Eq. (19) is motivated by the following considerations: (i) in the limit d ,  the GB effect becomes asymptotically irrelevant and Reff is equal to the equivalent  radius of the area A; (ii) in the limit d=0, the GB exactly bisects the plastic zone.
Hence, the characteristic area over which dislocation loops can expand is reduced  exactly by a factor 0.5, from A to A/2; (iii) in the general case, Eq. (19) provides a  simple analytic interpolation between these limits where the empirical factor η  determines the relative influence of d on the plastic zone size.
Taking  eff R  to be the effective radius of a circular slip zone in which  dislocations are piling up tangential to the GB, we can use standard relations of the  theory of dislocation pile-ups to derive a modified Hall-Petch relationship for the  indentation hardness:ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 27      HP 0 * eff K H H R   .
(20) Here  * eff eff 3 R R   is the projection of the effective slip zone radius, Eq. (19), which  is envisaged parallel to the indented [001] surface, onto a slip plane with normal  vector  (1/ 3)[111]  n .
The Hall-Petch coefficient KHP can then be derived within  the framework of pile-up theory.
For the parameters in our simulations we obtain HP 16.19 GPa K b  = 0.259 MPam1/2, see the derivation of Eq. (A6) in Appendix A.
This leaves us with two fit parameters, namely the ratio  of slip zone area to  indented area, and the asymptotic hardness  0 H .
An excellent fit to the data for all d  and h values considered in our simulations is obtained by using the parameters H0 =  4.87 GPa, and η=1.78.
Note that with these parameters, Eqs (19) and (20) account not  only for the dependency of hardness on distance between indenter and GB, but also  for the dependency on indentation depth.
This indicates that, in the regime where  indentation is controlled by dislocation nucleation underneath the indenter as  envisaged in our simulations, pile-up theories may provide an adequate representation  of the associated size effects even if two characteristic length scales (here: d and h)  are involved.
While our model provides a good representation of the hardness dependence on  distance to GB and indentation depth, one may ask whether the assumptions made in  deriving the Hall-Petch constant (circular slip zones, stress concentration due to a  classical pile-up) are not too strong.
It is obvious by simply looking at the simulations  that neither the slip zones are exactly circular, nor do the dislocations exactly follow  the arrangement expected for a classical pile-up.
On the side facing away from the  indenter, it would in fact be quite impossible for them to do so, given the absence of a  hard boundary.
To check whether our model, despite these caveats, possesses predictive power  regarding the distribution of dislocations, we focus on the area of interest between GB  and indenter.
We characterize the GND density in this area in terms of the averagedACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 28    GND tensor component magnitude  GND 32 23 ( ) (1/ 2) d d V V      , evaluated from  Eq. (18) over the volume  d y z V l l d     encompassed between GB (x=0) and  indenter (x=d).
The corresponding values of  GND( ) d V   were evaluated for all d  values studied in our simulations (red circles in Fig. 10) .
The pile-up model can now be used to evaluate the same quantity.
The derivation  of the GND tensor resulting from a pile-up on a single slip zone is given in the  Appendix, with the result given by Eqs. (A13) and (A14).
The overall GND density  tensor derives from this result as    || ( ) ( ) d d s s s s d x V V s V           α α n e b ,  (21)  where  || ( ) s d V   is the GND line density in slip system s in the direction parallel to the  GB, which for the pile-up model used here is for a given slip system calculated  according to Eq. (A13).
xe  is the unit vector in x direction (normal vector of GB  plane),  s n  and  sb  are the respective slip plane normal and Burgers vectors, and the  summation runs over all active slip systems.   From Eq. (21) the GND density magnitude  GND 32 23 ( ) (1/ 2) d d V V      corresponding to the pile-up model can be evaluated (red lines in Fig. 10).
We find  excellent agreement with the simulation data.
In particular, the increase of GND  density with increasing indentation depth is accurately predicted by the model.
In  view of the fact that the comparison between model and simulation does not involve  any additional fit parameters, it is fair to say the model despite its strong idealization  fully captures the interplay between GND density accumulation and indentation size  effect.
It provides accurate predictions of the influences of both GB-indenter distance  and of indentation depth on hardness and dislocation microstructure, and of the  accumulation of GNDs in front of the GB.
These predictions pertain to the regime of  very shallow indents where, as implicit in the initial conditions used in our  simulations, plastic activity is controlled by nucleation of dislocation loops  underneath the indenter but where bulk dislocation activation is irrelevant.

Comparison with experimental data  Based upon our simulations of shallow indentation of an Al bicrystal with a  symmetric tilt boundary, we have developed a modified Hall-Petch model describing  the process of slip transmittion through a GB during indentation and the associated  dependence of hardness on indenter-GB distance.
We now investigate whether the  model can be applied to a wider range of materials and boundary geometries.
To this  end, we make reference to the data of Soer et al. (2005) who conducted systematic  studies of indentation GBs of different types in Fe-Si and Mo.
Their study is  particularly useful in the present context because the indenter geometry and  orientation relative to the GB are comparable to those used in our simulations, and  also because Soer et al. (2005) provide extensive data regarding deformation  parameters both in terms of hardness and in terms of the deformation conditions at  which GB pop-ins were observed.
These data allow for direct comparison with  predictions of the model we presented in the previous section.
We first consider the occurrence of GB pop-ins.
A GB pop-in corresponds to a  situation where the stress at the GB reaches the critical level for slip transmission.
The  corresponding hardness value should relate to the effective slip zone radius, Eq. (19),  by the Hall-Petch relation (20), wherein the Hall-Petch coefficient depends on the  critical shear stress for slip transmission according to Eq. (A6) in the Appendix.
In  Figure 12 (a), for the Fe-Si bicrystals studied by Soer et al., the hardness at first GB  pop-in vs. the effective slip zone radius at that moment as evaluated from the data  given in Table 2 of Soer et al. using our Eq. (19).
The data are well represented by a  Hall-Petch law with Hall-Petch coefficient KHP = 1.41 MPam1/2.
We now use the same  Hall-Petch coefficient in conjunction with Eqs.
(19) and (20) to evaluate an average  hardness over the indentation depth range 80 nm < h < 200 nm and compare the result,  in Figure 12 (b), with the respective data by Soer et al. (2005).
Note that we restrict  the analysis to those data where the indenter configuration respective to the GB was  identical to our simulations.
It can be seen that the Hall-Petch coefficient determined  from the first GB pop-in, used in conjunction with the effective plastic zone radius  derived from our model, gives a good representation of the dependency of hardness HACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 30    on indenter-GB distance d.
This observation is corroborated by direct fits of Eqs.
(19,  20) to the H vs d data obtained by Soer et al. for a Σ3 and a Σ11 tilt boundary in Mo  (Figure 12 c and d), producing HP coefficients KHP = 1.81 MPam1/2 (Σ3) and KHP =  1.52 MPam1/2 (Σ11).
Again the fits give a good overall representation of the  experimental data, with the provision that the dip in hardness observed for the Σ3  boundary at h≈0.7 μm (attributed by Soer et al. to a change in dislocation nucleation  mechanism) cannot be reproduced.
Note that it is not possible to fit the experimental  data of Soer et al. with a standard Hall-Petch relationship  1/2 HP H K d    to the data     Fig. 12.

(2005).ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 31    of Soer et al. because this would imply a singularity of the hardness at small d,  whereas the experiments consistently show a smooth hardness maximum at or near  the GB.
It is interesting to compare the Hall-Petch coefficients obtained from our fits  with the HP coefficient deduced from our simulations.
For Al with the GB model  described above, we obtain a HP coefficient KHP = 0.259 MPam1/2 which is  significantly lower than those values we deduced from the experiments of Soer et al. This difference, as well as the absolute values obtained, is however in good agreement  with HP coefficients determined from indentation of ultra-fine grained metals  compiled by Wu et al. (2013).
The sources compiled by these authors give for Mo a  value KHP = 1.54 MPam1/2, for Fe a value KHP = 1.59 MPam1/2, and for Al a much  lower value of KHP = 0.285 MPam1/2.
It is at first glance astonishing that our model,  which is derived from simulations of a fcc metal with low Peierls stress and isotropic  dislocation mobility, can account for experimental data obtained on bcc metals such  as Fe-Si and Mo where Peierls barriers are appreciable and dislocation mobility is  highly anisotropic.
For Fe-Si, Zarubova and Sestak (1975) report at room temperature  a temperature-dependent contribution to the flow stress  0  (critical resolved shear  stress for dislocation motion) of about 50 MPa, and for Mo, Hollang and Seeger (2001)  find under the same conditions a temperature-dependent flow stress contribution as  high as 150 MPa.
This indicates that in the experiments of Soer et al. (2005), Peierls  stresses may yield an appreciable hardness contribution, which our model does not  take into account.
Moreover, bulk dislocation microstructures in RT deformed Fe-Si  or Mo consist of elongated dislocation loops with very long screw segments –  whereas in our study, we assume near-circular slip zones.
However, as can be seen  from Eq. (A4), the critical stress  0  influences only the ‘background hardness’ H0 in  Eq. (20), but not the Hall-Petch like stress contribution which depends on size and  indenter-GB distance.
Furthermore, the dislocation path in shallow indentation as  studied in the present work is not limited by dislocation mobility, but by the veryACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 32    small size of the plastic zone; hence, the quasi-static stress equilibrium arguments  underpinning our model can be transferred to materials with high Peierls stress.
We conclude that our simulations, as well as our model, give a good account of  GB influences on indentation hardness, provided the distance between indenter and  GB is sufficiently small and indentation is not too deep.
Otherwise, isotropic forest  hardening due to pre-existing as well as newly formed geometrically necessary  dislocations may dominate over pile-up induced forward and back stresses, and  activation of pre-existing dislocation sources may dominate over dislocation  nucleation at surfaces and grain boundaries.
This explains the differences between our  findings (and the experimental data of Soer et al. (2005)) on the one hand, and the  observations of Wang and Ngan, (2004) and Wo and Ngan (2004) on the other hand.
In line with the results of Soer et al. (2005), we find an increase of hardness with  decreasing GB-indenter distance, but this effect may be restricted to GB-indenter  distances less than 1 μm, i.e., distances comparable to the typical spacing of  pre-existing bulk dislocations.
At indenter-GB distances above 1 μm (the regime  studied by Wang and Ngan, (2004) and Wo and Ngan (2004)), the present  Hall-Petch-like mechanism is likely to become less relevant, because dislocation  pile-ups can in this regime be shielded by motions of pre-existing dislocations.
In this  regime, conventional gradient plasticity approaches (see e.g Nix and Gao, 1998)  might provide a more adequate modelling framework. 6.
Conclusions  In the present work, 3D multiscale DDD has been coupled with a penetrable GB  model to simulate nanoindentation of aluminum bicrystals.
Initial pop-in and GB  pop-in events were observed on the load-depth curves and the relationship between  hardness and distance to GB was investigated and interpreted.
The main findings are  summarized as follows:   (1) A three dimensional multiscale modeling framework has been established  which couples three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics with the finite element  method.
By considering the physical interaction mechanisms between dislocationsACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 33    and penetrable GBs this framework provides an efficient tool to investigate GB  effects on the nanoindentation of bicrystals and polycrystals.
(2) The first pop-in phenomenon in the nanoindentation load-depth occurs at the  moment of the first activation or nucleation of dislocations beneath the indenter,  indicating the transition from elastic to elasto-plastic response of the indented material.
The pop-in events occurring after the initial pop-in are mainly due to dislocation  transmission through GB and the intermittent operation of dislocation sources.
(3) Due to the GB hardening effect, the indentation hardness of a bicrystal  increases with decreasing distance between indenter and GB.
This GB effect  superimposes on the indentation size effect related to the plastic zone width and thus  the indentation depth.
The underlying dislocation microstructure shows that the GND  density between indenter and GB increases with decreasing GB-indenter distance,  leading to enhancement of GB hardening.
(4) The interplay between GND accumulation and back stresses on the plastic  zone can be captured by a pile-up model where the effective radius of a slip zone  depends both on indentation depth and on indenter-GB distance.
The model leads to a  modified Hall-Petch relation which correctly predicts the dependence of hardness on  both parameters, and which at the same time allows to quantitatively predict the GND  accumulation between GB and indenter.
This is particularly remarkable because we  observe in this region that increasing indentation depth and decreasing overall  hardness go along with increasing GND density – a finding which is difficult to  reconcile with conventional theories of indentation size effects (see Nix and Gao,  1998), which relate the size effect to geometrically necessary dislocations that cause  additional, Taylor-type isotropic forest hardening – a picture that is clearly  incompatible with the observation of a decreasing hardness despite increasing GND  density.
On the other hand, the same observation can, in our model, be readily  explained in the context of a pile-up theory: the GNDs not only cause a long range  back stress on the plastic zone (hence, kinematic hardening), but they also exert a  forward stress on the GB which facilitates slip transmission.
Therefore, an increasedACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 34    density of piled up dislocations between GB and indenter actually reduces the overall  hardness.
(5) The model provides relations between the hardness and indentation depth at  the first GB pop-in, and the distance between indenter and grain boundary, that can be  used to obtain Hall-Petch coefficients characterizing the dislocation-grain boundary  interaction from experimental data.
These coefficients can in turn be used to estimate  grain boundary strength in terms of critical resolved shear stresses for dislocation  transmission.
Alternatively, such Hall-Petch coefficients can be obtained by fits to   hardness vs. indenter-GB distance data obtained at fixed indentation depth.
Both  methods have been shown to yield mutually consistent results that are moreover, for  the simulated material system as well as for the systems studied experimentally by  Soer et al. (2005), consistent with literature data obtained independently by other  researchers.
(6) The developed model pertains to shallow nanoindentation, where the volume  probed by the indenter is devoid of pre-existing dislocations.
In such circumstances,  plasticity is controlled by dislocation generation near or at the indenter-sample  interface and no bulk dislocation sources or pre-existing bulk dislocations are  activated.
For experiments carried out under such circumstances, the equations we  derive based upon a modified Hall-Petch model may provide a useful tool for  analyzing the dependency of hardness on indentation depth and indenter-GB distance.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 35    Appendix: Some results from the theory of dislocation pile-ups     A. Stress concentration on the slip zone boundary and Hall-Petch coefficient  The theory of dislocation pile-ups in circular and elliptic slip zones was  developed by Eshelby (1963), using the close analogies with the problem of shear  cracks and of ellipsoidal inclusions.
Here we mainly refer to the very useful  compilation of results by Li and Chou (1970).
Consider the displacement across a  circular slip zone S of normal vector n and radius R, which is populated by  dislocations of Burgers vector b. Assume that the dislocations inside the slip zone are  in equilibrium under a shear stress , and that the critical flow stress for a dislocation  to move is  0 .
The displacement field across the slip zone then has the radially  symmetric form    2 2 0 8( )(1 ) ( ) ( ), ( ) (2 ) r u r u r R r b G            b u ,  (A1)  where r is the radial coordinate (Li and Chou, 1970).
The corresponding dislocation  lines can be identified with the circular contour lines where the displacement field has  the values kb and k is an integer number.
The number of dislocations in the pile up is    0 8(1 )( ) (2 ) R n G b            (A2)  and the average stress acting on the outermost dislocation (the dislocation located at  the boundary of the slip zone) is given by    0 ( ) 2 n n      .
(A3)  To assess the critical shear stress that must act in the slip zone for the outermost  dislocation to be transmitted through a GB at the boundary of the slip zone, we equate  n  to the critical resolved shear stress  CRSS   for grain boundary passing.
Using (A2,  A3) and resolving with respect to , we obtain the Hall-Petch type relationship    1/2 CRSS 0 (2 ) 4(1 ) G b R               .
(A4)ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 36    With Eq. (16) of the main paper, a GB misorientation angle of  5   and the  parameters of Table 1 we find  CRSS / 38 700 G     MPa.
A Hall-Petch coefficient for  indentation is then obtained from Eq. (A4) as follows: first we multiply by an  effective Schmid factor which for the near-[100] orientation of the indentation  direction used in our simulations we take to be  6 M  , to obtain an equivalent  relation for an axial yield stress .
Next, we multiply with a constraint factor C to  convert this yield stress into a hardness value H C  .
In applying this procedure a word of caution is appropriate.
The constraint factor  as introduced by Tabor (1951) accounts for the fact that the material within the plastic  zone pushes against the surrounding, plastically undeformed material and accordingly  experiences a back stress in form of a hydrostatic pressure.
This pressure, in turn,  reduces the shear stress driving plastic deformation, which therefore can only proceed  if an enhanced force is exerted on the indenter.
For metals where the bulk axial yield  stress is much less than the elastic modulus, a calculation assuming ideally plastic  behavior and an isotropic Von Mises type yield surface leads to a constraint factor  3 C  which relates the hardness to the uniaxial yield stress.
However, in the present case the assumptions of ideally plastic behavior and  plastic isotropy are surely unwarranted.
In fact, the entire model outlined above is  built on the assumption that plasticity is confined to platelet-like slip zones which  follow crystallographic slip planes, and in which significant back stresses are building  up, indicating kinematic hardening.
Furthermore, one might argue that the model  already accounts for the back stress of dislocations pushing against the boundary of  the plastic zone, and that the inclusion of a constraint factor runs into the danger of  counting these stresses twice.
It is therefore fortuitous that an actual evaluation of the constraint factor for the  present simulations demonstrate that this factor is irrelevant even if we take it into  account.
To this end, we evaluate the relationship between hardness and axial yield  stress using the results of Johnson (Johnson, 1970) who obtains for a conical indenter:ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 37      2 tan 1 ln 3 3 H E                  .
(A5)  For a conical indenter that produces for a given indentation depth the same  indentation area as a Berkovich indenter,  19.7  .
The Young’s modulus of Al as  assumed in the present simulations is  76 E   GPa.
In the present simulations,  typical asymptotic hardness values amount to  5 H   GPa which then leads, with Eq.  (A5), to the typical values  4.28 GPa, / 1.17 C H      .
We thus find that, under  the conditions prevailing in the present simulations, the confinement factor is close to  unity and indeed very different from its bulk value.
The reason for this discrepancy  with naive expectation is clear: here we are indenting a material where bulk  dislocation activity is absent and plasticity is almost entirely controlled by dislocation  nucleation underneath the indenter.
Accordingly, the equivalent axial yield stress is no  longer very small as compared to the elastic modulus, and deformation in our  simulations is mainly elastic and not plastic.
The theoretical calculation of the  confinement factor confirms what intuition leads to expect: back stresses are already  accounted for by the pile-up formalism, and the additional consideration of plastic  confinement is not actually of major impact on the results.
In the following we use the above calculated confinement factor  1.17 C  which  corresponds to the asymptotic hardness we expect for indentation distant from a GB,  and which is close to the lower limit  1.1 C   below which the calculation of a plastic  confinement factor becomes meaningless (Johnson, 1970).
We emphasize that our  results would change little if this factor were left out altogether.
The  Hall-Petch-coefficient for the GB effect on indentation then follows as     1/2 CRSS HP 0 HP (2 ) , 16.19 GPa 4(1 ) G K H K K MC b b R                .
(A6)ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 38    B. GND density in a slip zone segment  To derive the spatial distribution of the GND tensor corresponding to a circular  slip zone, we start from Eq. (A1) and note that the corresponding plastic distortion has  the form     p( ) ( ( )) ( ) S    β r n u r r ,  (A7)  where the integral of the delta-like distribution  ( ) S  r  over an arbitrary volume V  gives the area of intersection between the slip zone S and the volume V.       3 ( )d S V S V A r   r .
(A8) We may now evaluate the average over the volume V of GND tensor related to  the slip distribution (A1) in S. To this end, we use that the Burgers vector b and hence  the displacement u are parallel to S and introduce a slip zone coordinate system  , , x y z , where the slip zone is located in the plane  0 z   (hence, the unit vector  z  e n ), the y  axis is aligned with the intersection between the slip plane (normal  vector n) and the GB (normal vector xe ), hence  / y x x    e n e n e , and the unit  vector in x  direction is  / x x x     e n e n n e .
In this coordinate system, the  non-vanishing components of the dislocation density tensor are     ( / ) ( ) , ( / ) ( ) ( / ) ( ) , ( / ) ( ) xy y y S yx x x S xx x y S yy y x S b b u b b u b b u b b u                 r r r r .
(A9) We now consider a cuboidal volume  d V  of extension  y z d l l   , which intersects the  slip plane in such a manner that one of its sides is tangential to the slip zone and the  area of intersection  S V A  has the form of a circle segment as shown in Fig. A1.ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 39      Fig. A1.
Intersection of a circular slip zone S with the volume Vd contained between grain  boundary and indenter.
The coordinate axes represent slip system coordinates that are in general  inclined with respect to the system coordinates; d  is the projection of the GB-indenter distance d  onto the slip plane.
We now evaluate the dislocation density tensor averaged over the volume  d V  as    ( ) , ( ) , d d yx x d x yy x d y V V V b V b        .
(A10)  where     1 ( ) ( ) d d S Vd y d x y z A V u r x y bdl l         (A11)  can be understood as the average dislocation line density (line length per unit volume)   in y  direction.
Note that the two components  xy  and  xx , which represent line  components aligned with the x  direction and involve integration of the y   derivative of u, vanish upon integration due to symmetry.
The integration in (A11) can  be performed analytically using Eq. (A1), giving the simple result        2 0 4( )(1 ) 1 ( ) 2 (2 ) y d y z V Rd d bdl l G           .
(A12)ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 40    For a general slip zone that is not perpendicular to the boundary of Vd, the projected  segment width fulfills the relation  2 2 2 1/2 2 2 (1 ( ) ) x d d d       n e  which for    1/ 3 111  slip planes intersecting the plane (x=0) in a fcc structure gives the result  3/ 2  .
We may now combine Eq. (A12) with (A4) and (A6) to express the  averaged GND line density as     HP 1 (1 ) 4 6 ( ) (2 ) y d y z K R d b V l l CG b R        .
(A13) From this result, the GND tensor due to the considered slip zone derives as        ( ) ( ) ( ) d y d y y d x V V V            α e b n e b .
