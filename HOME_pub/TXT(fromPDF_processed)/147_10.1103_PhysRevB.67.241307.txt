We describe excitons in quantum dots by allowing for an interaction with a Fermi sea of electrons.
We argue that these excitons can be realized very simply with self-assembled quantum dots, using the wetting layer as host for the Fermi sea.
We show that a tunnel hybridization of a charged exciton with the Fermi sea leads to two striking effects in the optical spectra.
First, the photoluminescence lines become strongly dependent on the vertical bias.
Second, if the exciton spin is nonzero, the Kondo effect leads to peculiar photoluminescence line shapes with a linewidth determined by the Kondo temperature.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.67.241307 PACS number~s!: 73.21.La, 78.67.Hc, 78.55.Cr The Kondo effect concerns the interaction of a localized spin with a Fermi sea of electrons.1 It is a crucial effect in various areas of nanophysics where often a nanosized object with spin is in close proximity to a metal.2 Semiconductor nanostructures are ideal for investigations of Kondo physics because, in contrast to metals, their properties are voltage tunable.3 Characteristic to the Kondo effect are a screening of the localized spin and a resonance in the quasiparticle density of states ~DOS!
at the Fermi energy.
This leads to a maximum in conductance at very low temperatures in the transport through a spin- 1 2 quantum dot.4 So far, the Kondo effect in nanostructures has been studied almost exclusively in relation to transport properties.
In optics, Kondo effects have only been discussed theoretically with respect to non- linear and shake-up processes in a quantum dot.5,6 Here we present a theory of effects which arise from a combination of the Kondo effect and the optics of nanostruc- tures.
In our model, a charged exciton in a quantum dot ~QD!
interacts with a Fermi sea of free electrons.
We call the re- sulting quasiparticles Kondo excitons.
We suggest that such excitons can exist in self-assembled quantum dots where ex- citons with an unambiguous charge can be prepared in voltage-tunable structures.7 Furthermore, the wetting layer can be ﬁlled with electrons and used as a two-dimensional ~2D!
electron gas @Fig. 1~a!#, offering a simple means of generating a Fermi sea in close proximity to a quantum dot.
A signiﬁcant point is that self-assembled dots are very small, only a few nanometers in diameter, allowing the Kondo tem- perature TK to be as high as ;10 K. The time to form the Kondo state is ;\/kBTK;1 ps,8 which is much less than the typical radiative lifetime of 1 ns, giving the exciton enough time to form the Kondo state.
We ﬁnd that the pho- toluminescence ~PL!
from Kondo excitons is determined by the Kondo DOS at the Fermi level such that the PL line width is equal to kBTK (kB is the Boltzmann constant!.
Fur- thermore, the PL energy depends strongly on the Fermi en- ergy, and therefore also on the bias voltage.
This behavior contrasts with conventional single dot PL where the lines are very sharp depending only weakly through the Stark effect on the bias.7 In voltage-tunable structures, self-assembled QDs are em- bedded between two contacts.7,9 This makes it possible to control the number of electrons in a QD by the application of a voltage Ug @Fig. 1~a!#.9 By generating a hole with optical excitation, it has been demonstrated that there are regions of gate voltage with constant excitonic charge, with the exci- tonic charge changing abruptly at particular values of Ug .7 The charged excitons, labeled Xn2, contain n11 electrons and one hole.
Excitons with n up to 3 have been observed in InAs/GaAs quantum dots.7,10 At higher voltages, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy shows that electrons ﬁll the 2D wetting layer.9 In this case, the Fermi energy (EF) in the wetting layer depends linearly on Ug : we ﬁnd that EF 5(ao*/4d)(Ug2Ug o), where ao* is the effective Bohr radius, d is the distance between the back gate and wetting layer, Ug o is the threshold gate voltage at which electrons start to ﬁll the wetting layer, and d@ao* .9 Existing PL results in the regime of wetting layer ﬁlling show broadenings and shifts of the PL lines,7 which we believe is some evidence of an interaction with the Fermi sea, although this has not been analyzed in detail.
The excitons studied to date in the regime of a ﬁlled wetting layer are X32 and X42.7 X32 has zero spin and X42 suffers from intradot Auger broadening in the ﬁnal state, and therefore these excitons are unsuitable for Kondo physics. FIG. 1. ~a!

RAPID COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 241307~R! ~2003! 0163-1829/2003/67~24!/241307~4!/$20.00 ©2003 The American Physical Society 67 241307-1We argue here that X22 is the perfect exciton to study as it has a nonzero spin without intradot Auger broadening.
This exciton has not yet been studied with an occupied wetting layer.
Typically, the QD X0 and X12 excitons are strongly bound and exist only at gate voltages where the wetting layer is empty.
It is therefore unlikely that X0 and X12 can couple with the Fermi sea.
Instead, we focus on excitons X22 and X32 for which the electrons on the upper state may couple with extended states of the Fermi sea as we illustrate in Fig. 1~b!.
Since self-assembled QDs are usually anisotropic, we model a QD with two bound nondegenerate orbital states, having indexes s and p.
For a p state electron, the electro- static potential consists of the QD short-range conﬁnement and the long-range Coulomb repulsion from the charges in the lower s state.
This potential will therefore have a barrier at the edge of the QD @Fig. 1~a!#, allowing the p electron~s! to tunnel in and out of the QD.
To investigate the interaction between a quantum dot ex- citon and a Fermi sea of electrons, we employ the Anderson Hamiltonian which includes the single-particle energy Hˆ sp , the intra-dot Coulomb interaction, and a hybridization term Hˆ tun : Hˆ 5Hˆ sp1 1 2 ( a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 Ua1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 ee aa1 1 aa2 1 aa3aa4 2 ( a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 Ua1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 eh aa1 1 ba2 1 ba3aa41Hˆ tun , ~1!
where aa 1 (ba 1) is the intra-dot creation operator of electrons ~holes!; Uee and Ueh are electron-electron and electron-hole Coulomb potential matrix elements, respectively.
The index a stands for (b,s), where b is the orbital index and s the spin index; b can be s or p, and s56 1 2 for electrons and 6 3 2 for heavy holes.
Hˆ tun is given by Hˆ tun 5(k,sVk@ck,s 1 ap,s1ap,s 1 ck,s#, where the operators ck,s de- scribe the delocalized electrons in the Fermi sea; k and Ek are the 2D momentum and kinetic energy, respectively.
For the tunnel matrix element Vk , we assume Vk5V in the in- terval 0,Ek,D, and Vk50 elsewhere.11 In the operator Hˆ tun , we include only coupling between the p state and the Fermi sea.
In our approach, the quantization in a QD is as- sumed to be strong so that the Coulomb interactions can be included with perturbation theory.12,13 The tunnel broadening is the smallest energy in the problem.
By considering the tunneling through the barrier established by the Coulomb interaction, we estimate that the tunnel energy lies between 0 and 2 meV depending on the energy of the p state with respect to the bottom of the continuum.
Our approach is to solve Eq. ~1!
for the initial and ﬁnal states, and calculate the optical emission spectrum at zero temperature: I~v!5ReE 0 ` dte2ivt^iuVˆ o 1~t!Vˆ o~0!ui&, where ui& is the initial state and the operator Vˆ o 5Vopt(bs,23/2as,↑1bs,3/2as,↓) describes the strong transi- tions between the hole and electron s states.
We start with a zero bandwidth model, in which the Fermi sea is replaced by a single ‘‘delocalized’’ state of energy EF .1 In this simpliﬁed model, EF plays the role of the Fermi level, allowing us to predict the main features in the evolu- tion of the PL with Fermi energy.
We describe the electron wave function with the occupations of the electron states, labelling the delocalized state e.
The aim is explore the hy- bridization of the X22 and X32 excitons, so we consider four electrons and one hole.
We take the hole angular momentum as 1 3 2 ~denoted s13/2); equivalent results are obtained also with 2 3 2 .
The electron wave function of the hybridized ini- tial state before photon emission will have a total electron spin Se50.
We therefore express the ground state as ui& 5A1ui1&1A2ui2&, where ui1&5 1 A2 ~us↑,s↓,p↑,e↓&2us↑,s↓,p↓,e↑&)us13/2&, ui2&5us↑,s↓,p↑,p↓&us13/2&.
The states ui1& and ui2& correspond to the excitons X22 and X32, respectively ~Fig. 2!, and have energies Ei1 and Ei2.
The above energies Ei1 and Ei2 should be calculated in the absence of tunnel coupling.
In the Kondo function ui1&, the delocalized electron ‘‘screens’’ the net spin in the QD.
By diagonalising the Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd that the initial ground state has energy Ei5 1 2 @Ei11Ei22A(Ei12Ei2)218V2#, and that A152a/(11a2)1/2, A252A1 /a, where a5(Ei2 2Ei)/A2V.
As the energy EF increases, the ground state evolves from the X22 to the X32 exciton.
The transition occurs when Ei1 'Ei2 where EF'E1→25E2 intra2E1 intra where E1 intra and E2 intra are the intradot energies.
This transition indicates the so- called mixed-valence regime.1 To calculate Ei numerically, we represent a QD as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator tak- ing the electron ~hole!

After photon emission from state ui&, the ﬁnal state uf& has Se5 1 2 .
The intra dot conﬁguration in the X22 ﬁnal state is either a singlet (Sdot50), with a conﬁguration (1/A2) 3(us↑,p↓&2us↓,p↑&), or a triplet (Sdot51), with conﬁgura- tions us↑,p↑& and (1/A2)(us↑,p↓&1us↓,p↑&) ~Ref. 7! @Fig. 3~a!#.
The PL related to these conﬁgurations are well sepa- rated, typically by ;5 meV,7,10 due to the exchange interac- tion between the s and p states.
Nonzero optical matrix ele- ments exist for the three ﬁnal states: uf 1&5 1 A6 ~us↑,p↓,e↑&1us↓,p↑,e↑&22us↑,p↑,e↓&), uf 2&5 1 A2 ~us↑,p↓,e↑&2us↓,p↑,e↑&), uf 3&5us↑,p↑,p↓&.
In the state uf 1&, the intradot triplet state with Sdot51 is ‘‘screened’’ by the delocalized electron.
uf 2& has the singlet intradot state, and the function uf 3& plays the main role in the emission of the X32 exciton.
The calculated PL spectrum contains three lines ~Fig. 3!, labeled as Xt 22 , Xs 22 , and X32, with relative intensities 3 4 A1 2 : 1 4 A1 2 :A2 2.
Without the tunnel interaction, there is an abrupt jump in the PL from X22 to X32, but with the tunnel interaction the PL shows hybridization effects very clearly.
In particular, in the mixed-valence regime EF'E1→2, the intensity of the X22 lines rapidly decrease and the X32 line appears but the energies of all three lines depend on the delocalized state energy EF .
Hence, a clear prediction is that in the hybridization regime, the PL depends on the Fermi energy and therefore also on the gate voltage.
We focus now on the PL line shapes in the Kondo regime EF,E1→2.
While the zero bandwidth model is adequate for the general picture of the PL, we have to employ the ﬁnite bandwidth model in order to calculate the PL line shapes.
The initial Kondo state is the exciton X22 coupled with the Fermi sea.

Here, the energy d plays the role of the Kondo temperature in the initial state, TK .
The temperature TK can be as high as ;7–14 K for realistic parameters EF52–3.4 meV, D 51 meV, and D;30 meV.
It is worthwhile to note that an estimate for TK becomes even higher if we take into account the Coulomb charging energy and admix the exciton X12 to function ~2!.
In the regime EF,E1→2, the ﬁnal intra-dot conﬁguration is either a singlet or a triplet state @Fig. 3~a!#, as in the case of the zero bandwidth calculation.

However, the Kondo temperature for this ﬁnal state turns out to be much less than TK allowing us to use the non-interacting ﬁnal states to calculate the PL spectrum.
The singlet ﬁnal state, and also the X32 ﬁnal state, have higher energy and are broadened by energy D through tunneling into empty delocalized states.
From state ui& in Eq. ~2!, we write the spectral function I(v) in the form I~v!52ReFi ( b,b8 AbAb8Fb,b8G, where b can be either 0 or k, Fb,b85^fbuVˆ o 1Rˆ Vˆ oufb8&, and Rˆ 51/(Hˆ 1\v2Ei2i0).
We ﬁnd that the Xt 22 PL line has an asymmetric shape ~Fig. 4!: Xt 22~v!5Vopt 2 3DA0 2 2p E 0 D2EFde 1 ~e1kBTK!2 3Re 2i \v2E8~Xt 22!1e2ig , ~4!
where E8(Xt 22)5E(Xt 22)2kBTK is the renormalized emis- sion energy and g describes the broadening of the ﬁnal state.
We can expect g to be small since the relaxation of the ﬁnal state requires a spin-ﬂip,7 and in this case, kBTK@g , the PL linewidth is equal to KTK .
In other words, the PL reﬂects the spectral DOS near the Fermi level in the initial Kondo state.
The important result is that in the Kondo regime, both the PL peak position and the PL line shape depend on the Fermi energy and, hence, on the gate voltage.
Furthermore, as the temperature increases, the peak in the spectral DOS dimin- ishes rapidly,1 and therefore the linewidth of the Kondo ex- citon Xt 22 should also be strongly temperature dependent.
In the general case of arbitrary EF , the ﬁnite bandwidth model leads to a PL spectrum similar to that in Fig. 3~b!.15 The Xs 22 and X32 PL lines are close to Lorentzians, with linewidths of D due to the ﬁnite lifetime of the ﬁnal states.
It is important to emphasize that the Xt 22 ﬁnal state lies at lower energy and does not suffer from tunnel broadening, such that the line shape and linewidth are determined by many-body effects.
In summary, we have described excitons which can exist in self-assembled QDs when there is an interaction between a charged exciton localized on the dot and delocalized elec- trons in the wetting layer.
The charged exciton with nonzero spin is surrounded by a ‘‘cloud’’ @of radius }(kBTK)21] of Fermi electrons.
We predict several striking manifestations of these states in the emission spectra: at low temperature, the optical lines are strongly dependent on vertical bias, and their widths are determined by the Kondo temperature.
