An Experimental and Theoretical Study of Ni Impurity Centers in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 I. A. Sluchinskaya* and A. I. Lebedev Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia *e-mail: irinasluch@gmail.com Received January 19, 2017 Abstract—The local environment and the charge state of a nickel impurity in cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 are studied by XAFS spectroscopy.
According to the XANES data, the mean Ni charge state is ~2.5+.
An analysis of the EXAFS spectra and their comparison with the results of first-principle calculations of the defect geometry suggest that Ni2+ ions are in a high-spin state at the B sites of the perovskite structure and the difference of charges of Ni2+ and Ti4+ is mainly compensated by distant oxygen vacancies.
In addition, a considerable amount of nickel in the sample is in a second phase BaNiO3 – δ.
The measurements of the lattice parameter show a decrease in the unit cell volume upon doping, which can indicate the existence of a small amount of Ni4+ ions at the B site.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, ferroelectric oxides with the per- ovskite ABO3 structure attract much attention when discussing a possibility of designing various solar energy converters based on these materials.
In partic- ular, the idea of practical application of the bulk pho- tovoltaic effect consisting in the appearance of a pho- tocurrent or very high photovoltages upon illumina- tion of homogeneous crystals without an inversion center (including ferroelectrics) [1] has been discussed since 1970s [2].
However, since the quantum yield of this effect was low, the idea was not used in practice.
In recent years, the interest to ferroelectric oxides was revitalized due to the appearance of new ideas how to increase the efficiency of solar energy converters based on the bulk photovoltaic effect [3, 4].
The main disad- vantage of ferroelectric oxides is their comparatively wide energy gap (~3 eV), as a result of which they absorb only a small part of solar radiation.
To solve this problem, it has long been proposed to dope the oxides with 3d elements [5] that in some cases can result the formation of color centers.
Recent theoretical works showed that the substitu- tion for Ti in PbTiO3 with an impurity with electron configuration d8 (Ni, Pd, Pt) compensated by an oxy- gen vacancy made it possible to decrease the energy gap width of this material [6, 7].
The experimental studies of SrTiO3 doped with a number of 3d elements (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) [8–13] showed that the doping of SrTiO3 results in a strong absorption of light in the visible region and this effect is the most significant for Co and Ni impurities.
However, since strontium tita- nate is not a ferroelectric, it was decided to study a well-known ferroelectric BaTiO3 doped with nickel, believing that its absorption spectrum can be matched to the solar radiation spectrum.
Since nickel is used for fabricating contacts to a fer- roelectric ceramics, at the first stages of studying nickel-doped barium titanate, the main attention was focused on the determination of nickel solubility in BaTiO3, its influence on the Curie temperature, the dielectric constant, and other properties as well as on the influence of Ni on the transition to the nonpolar hexagonal phase P63/mmc that is stable in undoped BaTiO3 at temperatures above 1460°C.
It was shown that incorporation of Ni decreased the transition tem- perature to the hexagonal phase; however, the nickel solubility and its concentration needed for this transi- tion are strongly dependent on synthesis conditions and the available data are very contradictory [14–18].
It was found that Ni in BaTiO3 is an acceptor [19].
The nickel-doping of barium titanate decreased the dielec- tric constant and the Curie temperature and also resulted in smearing of the ferroelectric phase transi- tion in BaTiO3 as the Ni concentration increased [20– 22].
The kinetics of the transformation between the cubic and the hexagonal phases in BaTiO3 doped with various impurities was studied in [14].
It was shown that nickel favors the transition to the hexagonal phase, while the doping of BaTiO3 with strontium pre- vents this transition.
It was noted in [15] that BaTiO3 doped with nickel changes its color to dark-brown.
Information on the charge state and the structural position of Ni in BaTiO3 was mainly obtained from the DIELECTRICSPHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE   Vol. 59   No. 8   2017 AN EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDY 1513 EPR data and is also very contradictory.
The lines observed in the EPR spectra were ascribed either to ions Ni+ at sites B [23] or to off-center ions Ni+ at sites A [24].
In the EPR studies of nickel-doped hexagonal BaTiO3 [18], Ni3+ ions substituting for Ti4+ ions in two positions (Ti(1) and Ti(2)) were found.
However, the concentration of these centers was less than 5% of the nominal amount of nickel; i.e., most of the Ni ions in the sample were in the EPR-inactive state.
In [25, 26], we studied the charge state of Ni in BaxSr1 – xTiO3 by XAFS (X-ray absorption fine struc- ture) spectroscopy and showed that it changed from 4 to 2.5 as the barium content increased.
The first-prin- ciple calculations explained this result by different energies of the oxygen vacancy formation in SrTiO3 and BaTiO3.
The calculations of the electronic struc- ture of nickel-doped samples revealed the formation of an impurity band in the forbidden gap of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 and explained the cause of the strong impurity absorption.
In [17, 27], the authors noted the appearance of the ferromagnetism in BaTiO3(Ni) ceramic samples at 300 K, which was explained by the existence of oxygen vacancies [17] or the appearance of metallic nickel precipitates in the ceramics reduced in an Ar + H2 atmosphere [27].
In addition, of interest are the stud- ies of BaTiO3/Ni composites that exhibited interesting multiferroic properties, in particular, the possibility of the magnetization reversal by electric field [28], and also the works on development of a heterophase mate- rial with a very high dielectric constant near the perco- lation threshold [29, 30].
From the literature review, it follows that BaTiO3(Ni) is indeed a promising material that can provide an effective solar radiation absorption.
Because of this, the purpose of this work is to study the BaTiO3(Ni) samples synthesized in various conditions using the X-ray diffraction and other structural meth- ods.
Since the doping impurity can enter sites A and B of the perovskite structure and exist in them in differ- ent charge states [8], we use the XAFS spectroscopy to determine the structural position, the local environ- ment, and the charge state of impurities in BaTiO3.
2. SAMPLES, EXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATION TECHNIQUES Since the BaTiO3 structure can be transformed from the cubic to the hexagonal as a result of doping with nickel, and the addition of strontium prevents this transition [14], 20% SrTiO3 was added to BaTiO3 to retain its cubic structure.
The Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 samples doped with 3% Ni were prepared by solid-phase synthesis.
The starting com- ponents were BaCO3, SrCO3, nanocrystalline TiO2 obtained by hydrolysis of tetrapropylorthotitanate and dried at 500°C, and Ni(CH3COO)2 ⋅ 4H2O.
The com- ponents were weighted in required proportions, ground in acetone, and calcined in air in alumina cru- cibles at 1100°C for 4–8 h.
The prepared powders were ground again and annealed in air at 1500°C for 2 h. Then, a part of the samples was additionally annealed at 1100°C for 8 h, but, as was shown by the measure- ments, this did not change their properties (the exper- iment was performed to verify whether the nickel charge state would change as the annealing tempera- ture changes).
To incorporate the impurities into site B, the sample composition was intentionally deviated from stoichiometry to excess Ba.
The synthesis of the reference compounds NiTiO3 and BaNiO3 – x was described in [12, 13].
The phase composition was checked by X-ray phase analysis.
The X-ray absorption spectra were measured in the regions of the extended fine structure (EXAFS) and near-edge structure (XANES) on a KMC-2 station of the BESSY synchrotron radiation source (the electron energy was 1.7 GeV and the maximum current was 290 mA) at the Ni K-edge (8333 eV) at 300 K. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si1 – xGex (111) double-crystal monochromator.
The EXAFS spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode.
The intensity of the radiation I0 incident on a sample was measured using an ionization chamber, and the intensity of the fluorescence radiation If was measured using a RÖNTEC X-flash silicon energy-dispersive detector with the operating area of 10 mm2.
The EXAFS spectra were analyzed using the widely used IFEFFIT program package [31].
The oscillating EXAFS function χ(k) was extracted from the fluores- cence excitation spectra μ(E) = If/I0 (where E is the X-ray quantum energy) using the ATHENA program.
Then, by minimizing the root-mean-square deviation of the experimental k2χ(k) curve from the curve calcu- lated for a given model of the local environment of the impurity atom using the ARTEMIS program, the dis- tances Rj and the Debye–Waller factor   for the jth coordination shell were calculated.
Simultaneously, the energy origin correction dE0 was also varied.
The coordination numbers were taken to be constant and were given by the structural model.
The number of the adjustable parameters (9–15) was smaller than the number of independent data points Nind = 2ΔkΔR/π ≈ 20.
The dependences of the scattering amplitude and phase, the phase shift of the central atom, and the photoelectron free path on k for all single- and multi- ple-scattering paths required to build theoretical curves χ(k) were calculated using the FEFF6 software [32].
An important feature of the ARTEMIS program is the possibility of simultaneous fitting of the EXAFS spectra to a sum of several independent contributions.
An important feature of this work is that the pure geometric approach characteristic of standard EXAFS data analysis is complemented with the calculations of the geometry and the electronic structure of impurity σ2 j1514 PHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE   Vol. 59   No. 8   2017 SLUCHINSKAYA, LEBEDEV complexes, which enables us to estimate the physical feasibility of different structural models and so to increase the reliability of the results.
The geometry and the electronic structure of nickel-doped BaTiO3 were modeled from first princi- ples within the density functional theory using the ABINIT software package.
The calculations were per- formed on 40-atom (simple cubic) and 80-atom (fcc) supercells in which one of Ti atoms was replaced by a Ni atom (the Ni concentrations were 12.5 and 6.25%, respectively).
Since a nickel atom has a partially filled d-shell, we performed the calculations using PAW pseudopotentials [33] and the LDA + U approxima- tion [34].
Parameters U = 5 eV and J = 0.9 eV that describe the Coulomb and the exchange interactions inside the d shell were taken from the literature as typ- ical values of these parameters for Ni.
It was shown that a variation of these parameters within 20% did not substantially influence the results.
The cutoff energy was 30 Ha (816 eV); the integration over the Brillouin zone was performed on a 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack mesh for the simple cubic supercell or the mesh with the equivalent point density for the fcc supercell.
The relaxation of the lattice parameters and the atomic positions in the supercells was stopped when the Hellmann–Feynman forces became weaker than 10‒5 Ha/Bohr (0.5 meV/Å).
The modeling on 40-atom and 80-atom supercells without oxygen vacancies gives the results for the Ni4+ charge state of the impurity.
In order to change the charge state to Ni2+, either a vacancy was introduced into the system or we used a trick [35] in which two extra electrons were added to the system.
Although, in the latter case, the system was not electrically neutral, the tests showed that the addition of two electrons to the 80-atom supercell of barium titanate results in a small increase in the energy gap width (0.12 eV) and in the lattice parameter (0.61%); however, the obtained density of states and the Ni–O interatomic distances in doped samples were close to those calculated for the model, in which the Ni2+ charge state was obtained by adding a distant oxygen vacancy located at distance of 5.8 Å from the Ni atom.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 3.1.
X-Ray Diffraction Measurements Figure 1 shows a typical X-ray diffraction pattern of the samples under study.
The Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 samples doped with 3% Ni have the perovskite-type cubic structure with the lattice parameter 3.9723 ± 0.0013 Å at 300 K and were almost single-phase.
Small traces of a second phase in the angular range 2θ = 20°–30° belong to the Ba2TiO4 compound that often appears in ceramic barium titanate samples.
Comparing the obtained lattice parameter with the lattice parameter of undoped Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 solid solution (a = 3.978 Å) shows a slight compression of the lattice which indi- cates that the impurity incorporated into the sample.
The above lattice parameter for the undoped solid solution was obtained by an extrapolation of the data of [36] from the cubic phase to the region, in which the solid solution became tetragonal as a result of the fer- roelectric phase transition.
The incorporation of nickel to the solid solution decreased the Curie tem- perature in our samples below 300 K. 3.2.
Analysis of the XANES Spectra To determine the charge state of the Ni impurity in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3, we compared the position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra of the samples under study with the positions of the edges in the ref- erence BaNiO3 – δ and NiTiO3 compounds (Fig. 2).
It is seen that, in the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sample, the absorption edge is shifted by 0.7 eV from the absorp- tion edge in NiTiO3, where the nickel charge state is 2+, to the absorption edge in the reference BaNiO3 – δ compound, in which the nickel charge state is 3.4+ (the nickel charge state in this sample was determined in [12, 13]).
From the obtained absorption edge shift (see the discussion in [25, 26]), it is concluded that the mean charge state of Ni in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sam- ple is ~2.5+.
This implies that the most part of nickel ions in the samples is in charge state 2+ and only small part of them is in charge states 3+ or 4+.
This conclu- sion agrees with the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy about the main charge state Ni2+ in BaTiO3 [17]. 3.3.
Analysis of the EXAFS Spectra To determine the structural position and the local environment of Ni impurity in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3, the EXAFS spectra were analyzed.
The impurity center models were constructed taking into account the Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction pattern of the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(Ni) sample.
PHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE   Vol. 59   No. 8   2017 AN EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDY 1515 charge state of the impurity atoms obtained from the XANES spectra.
First, we analyzed the models, in which an impurity atom entered either sites A or sites B of the perovskite structure with a different local environment.
A criterion of agreement between the calculated and the experimental spectra was a small value of the R factor that quantitatively describes the discrepancy of the compared curves, the closeness of the value of parameter   to the value obtained from the analysis of the EXAFS spectra of the reference compounds, and a visual agreement of the Fourier- transforms of the spectra in the R representation.
The EXAFS data analysis of the NiO, NiTiO3, and metallic Ni reference compounds enables us to deter- mine the   value, which was equal to 0.92 for NiTiO3, 0.97 for NiO, and 0.77 for Ni.
An analysis of the model, in which a Ni atom in the charge state 2+ enters the A site both in the on-center and off-center positions, showed that the calculated spectrum on no account can describe well the experi- mental spectrum (the least value of the R factor was 0.408).
For an impurity atom at site B (Ni2+ substitutes for Ti4+), the sample must contain vacancies to provide the electrical neutrality of a sample.
Thus, we consid- ered two models: the model with an oxygen vacancy VO located in the first shell of the Ni atom (in this case, the shift of the Ni atom from the site was allowed to be up to 0.5 Å in the direction of the vacancy) and the model with a distant oxygen vacancy and the on-cen- ter position of the impurity atom.
A reasonable agreement between the experimental and calculated spectra was obtained in two cases, in which (1) atom Ni2+ substitutes for the Ti4+ atom and there is a distant oxygen vacancy VO and (2) atom Ni2+ substitutes for the Ti4+ atom and is displaced from site B toward vacancy VO located in the first shell.
Table 1 2 0 S 2 0 S gives the interatomic distances to the nearest shells and the values of the R factor obtained for these mod- els.
It is seen that, in the model with a distant vacancy, the Ni–O distances are close to the sum of the ionic radii of ion O2– and ion Ni2 + (  = 0.69 Å and = 1.4 Å), so that the XANES and EXAFS data agree well.
However, the parameter   in this model is underestimated.
As for the second model, unfortu- nately, we did not get a single-valued solution.
In addi- tion to the solution reported in [25, 26], we found two more possible solutions: one, in which the Ni atom is displaced by 0.1 Å toward the vacancy, and the other, in which the Ni atom is displaced in the opposite direction.
Table 1 gives the data for the latter solution with the lower R factor.
The appearance of several solutions with close RNi–O(I) distances to four atoms and substantially different RNi‒O(II) distances for the fifth atom (2.438, 2.178, and 1.873 Å) is related to the fact that the contribution of an individual atom O(II) to the EXAFS function is small, and the nonlinear regression problem can find one of numerous solu- tions corresponding to a local, not global, minimum.
4. RESULTS OF FIRST-PRINCIPLE  CALCULATIONS The analysis of the experimental data in Subsection 3.3 enabled us to propose several structural models that reasonably describe the experimental EXAFS spectrum.
To choose the most adequate model, we used the first-principle calculations to model the geometry of a number of impurity complexes contain- ing nickel.
In the modeling, particular attention was paid to configurations, in which nickel had charge state 2+ which is closest to that obtained in the exper- iment.
Although we have not obtained evidences that the nickel atom enters the A sites of the perovskite struc- ture, we considered this case, too.
The calculations showed that the position of the Ni2+ ion at the Ba site is unstable.
The modeling for an off-center Ni2+ ion at site A showed that this impurity center is diamagnetic and is characterized by nearly square planar configu- ration (the shift of Ni from the plane of four oxygen atoms is 0.195 Å) and short Ni–O distances (1.867 Å) that do not agree with the experiment.
In the case when a Ni atom enters the B site, the simplest case is that in which the nickel charge state coincides with the titanium ion charge (4+).
In this case, the electrical neutrality is not violated upon dop- ing, and the defect can be described as a point defect.
The calculations of the geometry of the 80-atom supercell showed that, as a result of relaxation, the dis- tances to the oxygen atoms in the first shell are 1.922 Å.
In this case the ion is in the diamagnetic state (S = 0).
The comparison of the calculated distances with those obtained from the EXAFS data analysis + 2 Ni R − 2 O R 2 0 S Fig. 2. XANES spectra of the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(Ni) sample and the reference nickel compounds.1516 PHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE   Vol. 59   No. 8   2017 SLUCHINSKAYA, LEBEDEV shows their marked difference; i.e., this defect geome- try does not agree with that observed in the experi- ment.
Actually, the local environment of nickel in barium titanate is more complicated, since the impurity charge (2+) found in our experiment suggests that the structure should contain an oxygen vacancy that com- pensates the difference of the charges of the Ni2+ and Ti4+ ions.
In our calculations, we first assumed that a vacancy in the formed Ni2+–VO complex is located in the first shell (this structure completely corresponds to the model considered in [7]).
The calculations of the equi- librium configuration of this complex performed for 80-atom supercell showed that the nickel ion is shifted by only 0.021 Å from the plane formed by four oxygen atoms.
The distance to four nearest O atoms in the plane is 1.925 Å and the distance to the fifth oxygen atom is 2.192 Å.
The impurity complex is diamagnetic (S = 0).
A comparison of the calculated interatomic distances with the distances obtained from the EXAFS data analysis shows that this model also does not agree with the experiment.
Prior to further discussion, we should make an important remark.
In all aforementioned models, the distances to the nearest oxygen atoms were close to each other and were slightly dependent on the ion charge.
This put us on the idea to perform additional calculations for a number of compounds of two-, tri-, and tetravalent nickel (NiO, NiTiO3, NiNb2O6, BaNiO2, BaNiO3, LiNiO2, SrNiO3, and PbNiO3).
The calculation showed that a “long” distance (1.97– 2.04 Å) is obtained only when the nickel atom is para- magnetic (S = 1) (Table 2).
As follows from Table 2, the interatomic Ni–O distance is determined primar- ily by the spin state of the Ni atom rather than by its charge and so, we first should focus our attention on the paramagnetic centers to explain the geometry of an impurity Ni center in BaTiO3.
It turned out that the complexes of the Ni2+ ion with an oxygen vacancy located in the fourth or more distant shells of a Ni atom (“a distant vacancy”) are such centers.
We considered three different configura- tions of the complexes.
In the first of them, the vacancy was located at a distance of 1.5 lattice con- stants along axis [001]; in the second of them, it was additionally displaced sideways.
In the third configu- ration, two extra electrons were added to the system (these electrons can be supplied by either oxygen vacancies or donor impurity atoms).
The relaxation of the positions of all atoms in these models showed that the mean Ni–O distances in them are 2.038–2.082 Å in better agrrement with the experiment.
5. DISCUSSION As follows from Section 4, the interatomic Ni–O distance is determined by the magnetic state of Ni to a greater extent than by its charge state (Table 2).
In addition, it was shown that the Ni2+–VO complex with the nearest vacancy considered in [7] is diamagnetic and is characterized by a set of distances that strongly differ from those obtained from the EXAFS data anal- ysis.
The Ni–O distance that was observed in the experiment, in our opinion, can be explained by Ni2+ paramagnetic complexes with distant vacancies.
How- ever, the analysis performed in Subsection 3.3 showed that in this case we are dealing with an underestimated value of   (Table 1). 2 0 S Table 1.

First, we assumed that a part of the Ni atoms in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 is in a higher charge state, which follows from the analysis of the XANES spectra (Subsection 3.2).
We considered a model, in which the nickel atom is at the B site in two charge states simultaneously.
We took into account a possible difference in the distances to the nearest oxygen atoms and the difference in the absorption edge energies of the atoms in different charge states.
A similar situation can be observed in the model in which Ni atoms have the same charge state but different magnetic states (S = 0 and 1); such a situation is possible, for example, when the Ni2+ ions form the complexes with the neighboring and distant vacancies simultaneously.
The difference of this model from the previous one is only in that the absorption edge energies are consid- ered to be the same in the latter case.
The results of the performed analysis are given in Table 3.
Although these models describe the experi- mental curve k2χ(k) quite reasonable, we encounter again an underestimated value of  .
Finally, the last group of the models were the mod- els that admit the existence of the second phase pre- cipitates in the samples.
The first of them was the model in which the cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) phase and microprecipitates of the hexagonal BaTiO3(Ni) phase coexist.
Two variants of incorporation of nickel into the hexagonal phase structure were analyzed, 2 0 S namely, into sites Ti(1) and Ti(2).
Although these models gave a reasonable agreement for a sum of  parameters of both the phases, the values of the R fac- tor characterizing the agreement between the curves were not quite low.
The parameters for the model with nickel at site Ti(1) are given in Table 3.
Then we have analyzed the models in which the samples were supposed to contain microinclusions which could appear at the grain boundaries in our ceramic powders and which are hardly detected using X-ray studies (X-ray amorphous phase).
We consid- ered the variants of inclusions of NiTiO3, NiO, metal- lic Ni, and the BaNiO3 – δ compound.
An analysis of the EXAFS spectra showed that the variants with inclusions of NiTiO3, NiO, and metallic Ni very insig- nificantly improved the agreement between the calcu- lated and experimental EXAFS spectra, since the frac- tion of the second phase was from 0.001 to 0.017, i.e., it was close to zero (the parameters describing the local structure of the second phase were obtained from the EXAFS data analysis of pure individual phases).
In this case the R factor was about 0.066.
The best agreement between the calculated and the experimental spectra was obtained for the model, in which the second phase is BaNiO3 – δ.
For this model, the R factor decreased by more than one order of mag- nitude as compared to that for the models considered above (Table 3).

Unfortu- nately, a strongly defective structure of BaNiO3 – δ, whose composition (0 ≤ δ ≤ 1) depends on the tem- perature and partial oxygen pressure during its synthe- sis, made it impossible to use the experimental EXAFS spectra in the analysis.
Because of this, the structure of BaNiO3 – δ was modeled from first princi- ples using the structural model of BaNiO3.
The results of fitting are given in Table 3.
The most important in this model is that the value of   finally became close to the values obtained for the reference compounds.
Taking into account that the second phase is formed by an individual nickel compound and the main phase is the solid solution with a nickel concentration lower than 3%, the ratio of the volumes of these phases can be estimated as 1 : 50, based on the ratio of the contri- butions of the two phases (values of  ).
Note that the distance of 2.438 Å that was attributed to oxygen in [12, 13], actually corresponds to the Ni–Ni distance in BaNiO3 – δ.
Note that the two pure compounds in the BaNiO3 – δ system, namely, BaNiO2 and BaNiO3, have similar local structures.
They consist of one-dimensional Ni– Ni chains extending along one of the axes with quite short Ni–Ni distance (about 2.4 Å) and two or three oxygen atoms located adjacent to this short bond.
When there are two atoms, they are arranged as planar NiO4 squares forming puckered chains; when there are three atoms, they form triangles whose centers are in the middle of the Ni–Ni bond.
When the number of oxy- gen atoms is intermediate, as is the case of BaNiO3 – δ, the atoms are located in random positions adjacent to the Ni–Ni chains.
There is no a long-range order in the arrangement of these atoms, and they are highly disordered.
This explains very high values of the Debye–Waller factors for the oxygen atoms in the sec- ond phase and a practical impossibility of observing precipitates of this phase in X-ray diffraction.
To sim- ulate the defective BaNiO3 – δ phase, we chosen the BaNiO3 phase, although either of the phases under discussion can be used when analyzing the EXAFS spectra.
In conclusion, we discuss the decrease in the lattice parameter observed in our samples upon their doping.
According to our measurements, the lattice parameter of the nickel-doped samples was 0.14% less than that of the undoped material.
Our calculations of the changes in the cubic lattice parameter upon doping gave the following results for the nickel concentration of 6.25%: +0.522% for the Ni2+ complex with a distant vacancy, –0.095% for the complex of Ni2 + with the nearest vacancy, and –0.74% for Ni4 + at the lattice site.
It is seen that the model of the complex with a dis- tant vacancy proposed in this work did not agree well with the X-ray diffraction data.
However, it should be noted that the lattice parameter also decreased in a 2 0 S 2 0 S nickel-doped SrTiO3, in which nickel entered the lat- tice as a Ni4+ ion.
Taking into account that the mean charge state in our samples is ~2.5+, we can suppose that a part of nickel in the samples has charge state 4+.
The systematic appearance of the solution with shorter Ni–O distances indicates that such short distances can be in the samples (Table 3).
Unfortunately, the fitting of the EXAFS spectra with simultaneous account of three models of the local environment is impossible because of very large number of adjustable parameters.
6. CONCLUSIONS The local environment and the charge state of the nickel impurity in cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 have been stud- ied by XAFS spectroscopy.
The analysis of the XANES spectra showed that the mean charge state of the Ni atoms is ~2.5+.
The analysis of the EXAFS spectra, which took into account the results of the first-principle calculations of the geometry of defects, suggests that Ni atoms enter the B sites of the per- Fig. 3.

In addition, based on the analysis of the EXAFS spectra, it was found that a considerable amount of nickel in the sample is in the form of the X-ray amorphous second phase BaNiO3 – δ.
The mea- surement of the lattice parameter and its comparison with the results of the computer modeling showed that the decrease in the unit cell volume upon doping could indicate the existence of a small amount of Ni4+ ions at the B sites in the samples.
The obtained results can be interesting for designing a new type of solar energy convertors that use the bulk photovoltaic effect in the material studied in this work.
