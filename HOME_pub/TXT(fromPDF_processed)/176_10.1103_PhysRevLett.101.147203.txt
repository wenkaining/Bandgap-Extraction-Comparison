We can strongly increase the coherence time by modifying the matrix in which the single-molecule magnets are embedded.
The electron spins are coupled to the proton nuclear spins of both the molecule itself and, interestingly, also to those of the solvent.
The clear observation of Rabi oscillations indicates that we can manipulate the spin coherently, an essential prerequisite for performing quantum computations.
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.147203 PACS numbers: 75.50.Xx, 03.67.a, 75.30.Gw, 76.30.v The key concept in quantum information processing is that a quantum bit (qubit) may be not just 0 or 1, as in ordinary computer bits, but an arbitrary superposition of 0 and 1.
This means that any two-level system, that can be put into a superposition state, is a qubit candidate [1].
The required superposition state is created by electromagnetic radiation pulses with a frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two levels [Fig. 1(c)].
The contribution of each of the two levels to the superposition state has a cyclic dependence on the pulse length, leading to so-called Rabi oscillations [1].
The observation of such oscillations is a proof-of-principle for the viability of per- forming quantum computations with a particular system.
Quantum computers will probably not be realized from single atoms but will most likely utilize solid state devices, such as superconducting junctions, semiconductor struc- tures, or molecular magnets [1,2].
For these large systems the quantum coherence decays fast, which drastically shortens the time available for quantum computation.
Molecular magnets have been considered as qubits be- cause they can be easily organized into large-scale ordered arrays by surface self-assembly [3], and because they possess excited electronic-spin states required for two- qubit gate operations [4,5].
Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are exchange-coupled clusters with high-spin ground states [6].
The Ising-type anisotropy creates an en- ergy barrier toward magnetization relaxation [Fig. 1(b)], and many fascinating quantum phenomena have been ob- served in these systems, such as quantum tunneling of the magnetization and quantum phase interference [6].
The large splitting of the two lowest states of SMMs in zero ﬁeld (in principle) allows performing coherent spin ma- nipulations without external magnetic ﬁeld, which simpli- ﬁes any practical implementation.
SMMs have also been proposed for the implementation of Grover’s algorithm [2] allowing numbers between 0 and 22S2 to be stored in a single molecule.
The long coherence time is a crucial ﬁrst step towards successful implementation of SMMs as qubits [1].
Therefore, recent years have seen a great deal of activity in trying to determine the quantum coherence times in SMMs, which was estimated to be of the order of 10 ns [7–10].
In several cases, energy gaps between superposi- tion states have been reported that are larger than the expected decoherence energy scale [9,11,12].
The phase memory or decoherence time of SMMs remains unre- solved, although magnetization detected ESR studies using pulsed microwave irradiation gave some indication of the spin dynamics [13,14].
In the low-spin system ferritin, on the other hand, there is evidence of quantum coherence [15].
Using pulsed electron-spin resonance [16], spin-spin relaxation or coherence times (denoted T2) were deter- mined in several molecular magnets and metalloproteins with S ¼ 1 2 ground states.
In iron-sulfur clusters, for in- stance, T2 is several hundreds of nanoseconds [17–19], while in the Cr7Ni and Cr7Mn antiferromagnetic rings, T2  400 ns at 4.5 K, increasing to 3:8 s for deuterated FIG. 1 (color online).

Recently, quantum oscillations were observed in the molecular magnet V15 [22].
Bertaina et al. also studied Rabi oscillations in a system with large angular momentum [23].
Here we show the ﬁrst direct experimental evidence for long-lasting quantum coherence and quantum oscilla- tions in a SMM, by using pulsed W-band (94.3 GHz) ESR spectroscopy.
We investigated the Fe4 complex [FeIII 4 ðacacÞ6ðBr-mpÞ2] [Fig. 1(a)], where acac is acetyl acetonate or 2,4-pentanedionate, and Br-mp3 is the anion of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (Br-mpH3) [24].
This molecule was chosen because the zero-ﬁeld splitting is such that the ground state magnetic resonance transition is close to zero ﬁeld in our spectrome- ter, in contrast to the case of other thoroughly investigated and chemically similar Fe4 clusters [25].
In this molecule the central iron(III) spin is coupled antiferromagnetically to the peripheral iron(III) spins resulting in an S ¼ 5 molecular spin ground state.
The MS states of this multiplet are split with the MS ¼ S at lowest energy (Ising-type anisotropy).
This anisotropy leads to a splitting between the lowest two spin microstates of 92.4 GHz, and the corresponding ESR transition occurs conveniently close to zero applied ﬁeld in our Bruker ELEXSYS E680 W-band ESR spectrometer [24].
The material was diluted into a frozen solvent matrix to limit decoherence due to intermolecular magnetic-dipolar interactions, which is the main decoherence pathway in crystalline samples [26].
For concentrations lower than the used 0:5 mg=mL, experi- ments did not show a signiﬁcant increase in spin relaxation times.
In the following, we report the determined spin- lattice relaxation time (T1) and the phase coherence time (T2), the coupling between electron and nuclear spins, and ﬁnally transient nutation experiments that show the occur- rence of Rabi oscillations.
Figure 2(a) shows the Hahn echo intensity of the Fe4 complex in toluene as a function of delay time  (=2        echo, =2 pulse length is 14 ns), at zero external ﬁeld for T ¼ 4:3–11:0 K. At all temperatures, the decay is monoexponential where the time constant is the coherence time T2.
At T ¼ 4:3 K, T2 ¼ 307  20 ns and it decreases strongly with increasing temperature.
The clear observation of a Hahn echo unambiguously proves that quantum coherence in Fe4 is much longer than pre- viously estimated for SMMs.
The spin-lattice relaxation time T1 [Fig. 2(b)] was de- termined by using an inversion recovery sequence (    =2  fixed    fixed  echo).
At T ¼ 4:3 K, T1 ¼ 1056  20 ns [Fig. 2(c)] and it decreases with in- (a) (f) (e) (d) (c) (b) FIG. 2 (color online).

The strong temperature dependence of T1 evidences that spin-lattice relaxation must occur through a two-phonon process, because the direct process is expected to be little dependent on temperature [27].
We cannot clearly distinguish between Raman and Orbach processes, due to the limited temperature range accessible.
However, in exchange-coupled clusters the spin-lattice relaxation mechanism is often an Orbach process where an excited spin state functions as the intermediate state [28].
A ﬁt to the Orbach formula yields an energy gap of the order of  ¼ 5 cm1, which is clearly within the ground multiplet.
The (super)hyperﬁne coupling between the nuclear and electron spins is known to be the major decoherence path in both molecular and nanostructured systems [1,20,29].
To investigate the coupling to the nuclear spin bath of the matrix, we investigated Fe4 samples in three different solvents: normal and fully deuterated toluene and CS2.
The ﬁrst of these solvents contains a large number of protons to which the electron spin can couple.
The second only contains deuterium atoms, which couple much more weakly, while in the third solvent nuclear spins are com- pletely absent.
Hahn echo measurements at an applied external ﬁeld of B0 ¼ 0:373 T exhibit a clear modulation of the echo superimposed on the exponential decay [Fig. 2 (d)] for samples in toluene or toluene-d8.
This modulation is due to the coupling of the nuclear spin to the electron spin [electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) [16]].
After subtraction of the background exponential decay, the dominant ESEEM frequencies can be ob- served both in time domain [Fig. 2(e)] and after Fourier transformation in the frequency domain [Fig. 2(f)].
The dominant ESEEM frequency of Fe4 in toluene, 15:6  0:3 MHz, is the same as the free Larmor frequency of protons at 0.373 T (15.9 MHz).
For Fe4 in toluene-d8, the dominant frequency is 2:5  0:2 MHz, which is the free Larmor frequency of deuterium atoms (2.4 MHz).
Interestingly, this indicates that we observe the coupling of the electron spin to the nuclear spin of the solvent rather than to the 58 protons of the Fe4 molecule itself.
Accordingly, no clear ESEEM was observed for Fe4 in the CS2 solvent, which has no signiﬁcant amounts of non- zero nuclear spins.
In toluene-d8, T2 is virtually the same (279  20 ns at 0 T) as for normal toluene, which shows that decreasing the coupling to the nuclear spin bath does not increase coherence times, in contrast to what was observed in the measurements by Ardavan et al. [20].
However, for Fe4 in CS2, the coherence time T2 increases dramatically to 527  20 ns at 0 T. This observation leads to two very important conclusions.
First, the coupling to the Fe4 nuclear spins is not the primary decoherence path- way, and, second, the solvent nuclear spins must be re- moved entirely to suppress decoherence.
This increase of T2 in CS2 is accompanied by an increase in T1, which was determined to be T1 ¼ 943 ns at 4.3 K and 0 T, which shows there is no simple relation between T1 and T2.
We performed echo-detected ESR measurements (Fig. 3), in which the echo intensity after the Hahn echo sequence (fixed ¼ 185 ns) was recorded as a function of static magnetic ﬁeld B0 for samples of Fe4 in toluene, toluene-d8, and CS2.
We see echo intensity over the whole ﬁeld range from 0–2 T, which is expected because mole- cules with different orientations with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld B0 are excited at different ﬁelds over the entire studied ﬁeld range.
For Fe4 in toluene we observe equally spaced modulations of the echo intensity between 0 and 0.7 T. Theory predicts maxima of this modulation at Bn ¼ 2n= (n ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ) , where  is the gyromag- netic ratio of the nucleus and  is the pulse separation [16], and the ﬁeld positions of the observed maxima are consis- tent with calculated ﬁeld values for 1H nuclei (Fig. 3).
Surprisingly, we see the ﬁrst two maxima of the echo modulation due to 1H nuclei also for Fe4 in toluene-d8 and CS2, which shows that the electron spin is also coupled to intramolecular protons.
The decrease in intensity for 0:2 < B0 < 0:65 T in the spectrum of the toluene-d8 sample agrees with the expected echo intensity minimum due to coupling to 2H nuclei at 0.41 T. At higher ﬁelds the modulation disappears, because the nuclear modulation depth is proportional to B2 0 [16].
The echo intensity decreases with ﬁeld for B0 > 0:8 T, despite the fact that one expects about the same number of molecules to be excited at all ﬁelds.
This intensity decline is accompanied by a decrease in T2 for B0 > 0:1 T (Fig. 3), meaning that less spins can be refocused after the ﬁxed delay time of 185 ns, with concurrent smaller echo intensity.
At B0 ¼ 0:1 T, T2 reaches its maximum value of T2 ¼ 630  30 ns for Fe4 in CS2.
Finally, we have performed transient nuta- tion experiments which correspond to generating arbitrary superposition states of the SMM.

Fields at which nuclear modulation maxima for the coupling to protons are expected are indicated with vertical orange lines.
T2 was determined at different ﬁelds in CS2 (blue triangles, right- hand scale).
PRL 101, 147203 (2008) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 3 OCTOBER 2008 147203-3ment, the electron spin is rotated by an arbitrary angle, after which the spins are refocused with a  pulse and the echo intensity is detected [16].
Figure 4 displays the echo intensity as a function of the duration of the ﬁrst pulse, showing clear intensity oscillations with a frequency of 17:6  0:5 MHz at zero external ﬁeld and maximum mi- crowave power, i.e., largest B1 ﬁeld.
These oscillations are coherent electron-spin oscillations; i.e., they are the ﬁrst demonstration of Rabi oscillations in SMMs.
This inter- pretation is supported by the fact that the Rabi frequency depends linearly on the microwave power (Fig. 4) [16].
It should be noted that the oscillations cannot be due to ESEEM-type nuclear modulation because they occur at zero ﬁeld.
The decay of the Rabi oscillations with delay time is highly nonmonoexponential for two reasons.
First, the presence of a distribution in zero-ﬁeld splitting parame- ters (D strain) can be expected, and second, there will be a distribution in orientation of the molecule with respect to the microwave ﬁeld.
Therefore, molecules with slightly different Rabi frequencies will be excited, which leads to a faster decay of the observed Rabi oscillations than ex- pected on the basis of the coherence time alone.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that sizable quan- tum coherence times and coherent spin manipulations are possible in single-molecule magnets.
Much longer quan- tum coherence times in the microsecond range can be predicted at lower temperatures based on the strong depen- dence of T2 on temperature.
For instance, the extrapolation of T2 in Fig. 2(c) yields a coherence time of T2  750 ns at 0 K, and even larger low-temperature T2 values are ex- pected for Fe4 in CS2.
In addition, coherence times can be signiﬁcantly improved by careful tailoring of the SMM and its surroundings and may reach values that are suitable for practical qubit implementation.
