Abstract.
In this work we study the electronic structure of Ag3AuSe2 and
Ag3AuTe2, two chiral insulators whose gap can be tuned through small changes
in the lattice parameter by applying hydrostatic pressure or choosing diﬀerent
growth protocols. Based on ﬁrst principles calculations we compute their band
structure for diﬀerent values of the lattice parameters and show that while

Ag3AuSe2 retains its direct narrow gap at the Γ point, Ag3AuTe2 can turn into a
metal. Focusing on Ag3AuSe2 we derive a low energy model around Γ using group
theory, which we use to calculate the optical conductivity for diﬀerent values of
the lattice constant. We discuss our results in the context of detection of light
dark matter particles, which have masses of the order of a keV, and conclude that
Ag3AuSe2 satisﬁes three important requirements for a suitable detector: small
Fermi velocities, meV band gap and low photon screening. Our work motivates
the growth of high-quality and large samples of Ag3AuSe2 to be used as target
materials in dark matter detectors.

1. Introduction
Narrow gap semiconductors belong to a particular branch of the semiconductor
family, those with a narrow forbidden energy window, the gap, between valence and
conduction bands. They were ﬁrst applied as infrared detectors, with Hg1−xCdxTe
[1] as a representative example, due to its largely tunable band gap around infrared
frequencies.
A particularly recent and promising application of narrow gap semiconductors
is the direct detection of light dark matter particles [2, 3, 4], an approach that
complements those based on superconductors [5, 6, 7] and phonons in polar
materials [8]. GaAs and sapphire are two extensively studied examples of the above
[9]. These proposals are tailored to detect dark matter particles with keV masses,
which requires materials with gaps in the meV range [3] to match the expected energy
deposition.
To increase their sensitivity, narrow gap semiconductors must satisfy
additional requirements, such as small Fermi velocities compared to the maximum dark
matter velocities, or practical viability in terms of cost and purity [2, 4]. They should
also have a clean bandstructure around the Fermi level, ideally having a localized
narrow gap with a much bigger gap along the rest of the Brillouin Zone.
In this context, it is possible to achieve a highly tunable gap by changing the
lattice parameter, either by applying hydrostatic pressure or by changing the method
used to grow the crystal. This has the eﬀect of bringing the ions closer (or farther)
from each other, translating into small changes in the band structure. With ab-initio
techniques, it is possible to predict the eﬀect of small changes of the lattice parameter
in the bands, in particular the magnitude of the gap.
Fischesserite (Ag3AuSe2) and petzite (Ag3AuTe2) are both naturally occurring
(and easily grown) minerals [10, 11, 12] that have been studied, both theoretically
and experimentally [13, 14, 15, 16]. They both have a narrow, direct gap, centered
at Γ, which makes them optically active. They have been previously found to have
important mechanical applications, as well as interesting thermoelectric properties
(large room-temperature Seebeck coeﬃcient), and are also known to possess large
magnetoresistance[14, 17]. In this work we study the eﬀect that small changes in the
lattice parameter have on the properties of Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2, to ﬁnd that
their gap is highly tunable through hydrostatic pressure.
We perform a theoretical analysis of the band structure for both compounds,
which share spectral properties, and we focus on Ag3AuSe2 to calculate its optical
conductivity using an eﬀective model for the bands near the Fermi level. We conclude
by discussing the suitability of this material to detect light dark matter particles.
2. Analysis based on Density Functional Theory
Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2 crystallize in the Sohncke space group I4132 (space group
214, see Fig. 1), and are predicted to hold high order topologically protected nodal
points in their band structure [18]. In the absence of external pressure, both have been
diagnosed as trivial insulators in a recent works [19, 20, 21]. Space group I4132(214) is
a chiral non-symmorphic space group; it is not centro-symmetric or mirror-symmetric
and some of the symmetry operations contain non-integer translations [22].
We have used Density Functional Theory (DFT) [25, 26] as implemented
in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [27, 28] to perform band
structure calculations. To account for the interaction between ion cores and valence

electrons we used the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) [29].
We use the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation potential with
the Perdew-Burke-Ernkzerhof functional for solids parameterization [30] and consider
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) interaction as implemented within the second variation
method [31]. Although it has a small eﬀect in the width of the gap, SOC is important
to extract the eﬀective values of the Fermi velocities. We have used a Monkhorst-Pack
k-point grid of (7 × 7 × 7) for reciprocal space integration and a 500 eV energy cutoﬀ
of the plane-wave expansion.
We have computed the band structures for both compounds, Ag3AuSe2 and
Ag3AuTe2, for diﬀerent values of the lattice parameters along high-symmetry points
of the Brillouin zone. Fig. 2 shows that the gap of Ag3AuSe2 increases from 13.8
meV to 60 meV for a compression of 2%, and reaches 200 meV for a compression
of 4% at Γ, keeping it as a global direct gap.
This implies that the interband
optical conductivity and the suitability as a dark matter detector, both relaying on
the interband transitions across the gap [2], will be determined by the bands in the
neighborhood of the Γ point for a wide range of frequencies. The Te-based compound
on the other hand is a semiconductor with small indirect gap originally, and the
change in the lattice parameter transforms it into a metal. Therefore, among these
two, Ag3AuSe2 is the most promising for detector applications, due to its small tunable
direct band gap at Γ. In the next section we construct an eﬀective model around this
high-symmetry point to further analyze its optical conductivity and potential as a
dark matter detector.
3. Eﬀective model
In this section we use group theory to construct the most general low energy
Hamiltonian allowed by symmetry for the four last valence and ﬁrst two conduction
bands. We also allow terms that couple the valence and conduction band sub-spaces,
resulting in a six-band model.
To determine the free parameters of the eﬀective
Hamiltonian we ﬁt its spectrum to the ab-initio bands found in the previous section

3.1. How to build eﬀective models
In general, an eﬀective Hamiltonian, which will describe the crossing of n bands, can
be written as
H(⃗k) = Ψ∗
i Hi,j(⃗k)Ψj =
n

i,j
Ψ∗
i ΨjHi,j(⃗k) =

a
(Ψ∗Ψ)a Ha,
(1)
where Ψi are the Bloch states of the Hamiltonian and (Ψ∗Ψ)a are the bilinears, that
can be written as
(Ψ∗
i Ψj)a = λa
ij,
(2)
where a ∈{0, 1, 2, ..., n2} labels the bilinear and λa are complex Hermitian matrices
that form a basis under which the Hamiltonian can be expanded.
In the following we will develop the low energy Hamiltonian for Ag3AuSe2.
Diﬀerent values of the model parameters correspond to diﬀerent values of the lattice
constant by which we take into account diﬀerent values of the hydrostatic pressure.

the original. Inset: the narrow gap at Γ lies between a twofold fermion (Weyl
fermion) and a fourfold-fermion. The interband transition across the gap is the

arrow. Each horizontal tick corresponds to 10 meV.
transitions across the gap we aim to construct the lowest order model that describes
optical transitions across the minimal gap, which occurs at the Γ point. We focus
on the ﬁrst four valence bands below the Fermi level, forming a 4 dimensional energy
crossing topologically protected by symmetry (fourfold fermion), and the ﬁrst two
conduction bands above the Fermi level, described by a two-dimensional crossing also
topologically protected by symmetry (twofold fermion)[13], as shown in the inset of
Fig. 3.
To construct Hamiltonians invariant under the point group operations, we need
to ﬁnd combinations of bilinears and powers of momentum that transform under the
trivial representation of the little group at Γ, which is isomorphic to the Point Group
O (432).
Powers of crystal momentum will transform under symmetry operations
as a representation ρ. In particular, for this group the representation under which
momentum transforms reads
ρ(⃗k) = T1(kx, ky, kz) ⊕A1(|⃗k|2) ⊕T2(kykz, kzkx, kxky) + O(k3),
(3)
where T1, A1 and T2 are irreducible representations of the Point Group O.
Given
the representation expansion of the momentum in Eq. 3, we can form invariants from
the combination of bilinears that transform under those same representations. The
twofold band crossing is composed of two quadratic bands, and thus we consider second
order terms in the momentum. For the fourfold band crossing and the coupling terms
between the fourfold and twofold sub-spaces linear order in ⃗k will suﬃce. This will give
us the lowest possible order Hamiltonian that contributes to the optical conductivity.

3.2. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for conduction bands
In this case we need to ﬁnd bilinears that transform under T1, A1 and T2. In the basis
of Pauli matrices, the bilinears transform as
ρ(σμ) = A1(σ0) ⊕T1(⃗σ).
(4)
The absence of T2 in the expansion implies that there is no symmetry-allowed term
that can go with T2(kykz, kzkx, kxky). Thus, the eﬀective Hamiltonian reads
H2band = α|⃗k|2σ0 + vF⃗k · ⃗σ =

α|⃗k|2 + vF kz
vF (kx −iky)
vF (kx + iky)
α|⃗k|2 −vF kz

, (5)
where α and vF are the coeﬃcients that will be ﬁtted to our ab-initio results.
3.3. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for valence bands
For the fourfold band crossing a basis of 4 × 4 Hermitian matrices is required. Since
there are only two sets of matrices that transform under the T1 representation ( ⃗λ1 and
⃗λ2), there are only two linear terms in momentum allowed in the Hamiltonian

3.4. Coupling Hamiltonian
So far we have computed the eﬀective Hamiltonians for the twofold band and fourfold
band crossings. Since these two Hilbert subspaces are orthogonal to each other, the
matrix elements of the interband current operator, relevant to compute the optical
conductivity, will vanish. To describe transitions accross the gap that connect the
fourfold and twofold bands we have to add symmetry allowed terms that mix these
two subspaces. There is only one allowed term at ﬁrst order in momentum, which
reads

where we have added the parameter Δ that sets the gap between the twofold and

We obtained the values of the parameters in the
Hamiltonian Eq. (8) by ﬁtting ab-initio bands for three diﬀerent choices of lattice
parameters. Labelling the unperturbed lattice parameter as a0 [32], we deﬁne the
lattice parameter under pressure as a = pa0 for p = 0.99, 0, 98, 0.97, which amounts to
compressions by 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. We display the ﬁtted values in Table
1, and the corresponding bands are plotted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) for 1% compression,
and Fig. 5 (a) and (b) for 2% and 3% compression, respectively.

4. Optical conductivity
In this section we compute and discuss the interband optical conductivity of the six-
band k · p Hamiltonian describing the band structure of Ag3AuSe2 near the Γ point
for three diﬀerent hydrostatic pressures: 1%, 2%, and 3% compression of the lattice
parameter. In all three cases, the band structure exhibits a fourfold node below the
Fermi level and a Weyl node above it, separated by a gap whose size will depend on
the pressure.

En−μ, where μ is the chemical potential and nF is the Fermi function, which depends
on ϵn, μ, and the inverse temperature β = 1/kBT in units of the Boltzmann constant
kB.
4.1. Optical conductivity and relevant transitions for a given lattice parameter
As discussed in the previous section, for the three values of compression 1%, 2%, and
3%, the bands are separated into a set of four bands, which we refer to as valence
bands, that deﬁne the fourfold fermion below the chemical potential, and a set of two
bands, which we refer to as the conduction bands, that deﬁne the Weyl fermion above
the chemical potential. Note that while in in the full ab-initio bands there exists a
full gap between the two sets of bands (see e.g. Fig. 3), in the low energy model the
gap is not fully open.
To understand the relevant optical transitions and their contribution to the optical
conductivity we ﬁrst ﬁx the lattice constant to a compression of 1% by choosing the
corresponding set of parameters (see Table 1). The band structure of the resulting
k · p Hamiltonian is shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) with two diﬀerent scales for better
readability, together with the relevant activation frequencies. The energies involved in
the transitions between the fourfold fermion and the Weyl fermion are smaller than in
the other two cases, which allows us to study the behavior of the optical conductivity
with all possible activation frequencies in a smaller energy range.

Optical conductivity of the low energy k · p model of Ag3AuSe2
under 1% hydrostatic pressure. (a) and (b) show the same band structure within
two diﬀerent energy windows, together with the relevant frequencies for optical
transitions (colored vertical arrows) and the chemical potential (blue horizontal
line).
The bands are labelled with numbers from 1 to 6 from bottom (orange
band) to top (pink band).
Figures (c) and (d) show the optical conductivity
corresponding to valence to conduction band transitions (c) and interband
transitions between the valence bands (d), with β = 1/kBT = 2 × 103.
The transitions between the six bands can be divided in two groups: the ones
that only concern transitions between the valence bands, with activation frequencies
ωi with i ∈[3, 8], and those corresponding to transitions connecting the valence and
the conduction bands, with activation frequencies ωi with i = 1, 2 and i ∈[9, 12].
Since in the real material the transitions between the fourfold valence bands will be
Pauli blocked, we separate them from those connecting the valence and conduction
bands, which are the only ones allowed in the real material. This justiﬁes our choice
of chemical potential: it is close to the Weyl node, shifting the activation frequencies
between bands of the fourfold to higher frequencies.
In Fig. 4 (c) and (d) we show the optical conductivity associated to both types of
transitions, with the characteristic frequencies represented by vertical lines matching
the colors in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). The valence to conduction transitions are shown
in Fig. 4 (c), which shows a characteristic maximum that falls oﬀas the frequency
is increased. On the other hand, Fig. 4 (d) shows the transitions between valence
bands, which display a linear behaviour σ ∝ω characteristic of an asymmetric fourfold
fermion [34]. In both cases, the changes in the optical conductivity match well the

activation frequencies expected from the band structure in Fig. 4 (a) and (b).
The optical conductivity of the six-band k · p Hamiltonian applies strictly to a
narrow region in momentum-energy space yet Fig. 4 is enlightening to understand
what to expect from the optical conductivity of the real Ag3AuSe2 and, in the next
section, its usefulness to detect light dark matter.
4.2. Optical conductivity for diﬀerent lattice parameters
As we increase the pressure to 2% (Fig. 5 (a)) and 3% (Fig. 5 (b)) the gap becomes
larger, and the parameters describing both the fourfold and the Weyl fermion are
modiﬁed (see Table 1). The Fermi velocity of the bands for each case, an important
parameter for light dark matter detection [2], as well as the oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements connecting the fourfold and the Weyl fermions, change. Upon doing so, they
modify the energy scales involved in the optical transitions, thus shifting the activation
frequencies from valence to conduction interband transitions to higher energies with
higher separation between them.
This results in a slower change of slope in the
optical conductivity and, as the pressure increases, the optical conductivity arising
from valence to conduction interband transitions is closer to a linear behaviour σ ∝ω,

as shown in Fig. 5 (c).
Since we have placed the chemical potential close to the Weyl node, the activation
frequencies of the interband transitions between the valence bands are shifted as the
pressure increases proportionally to the chemical potential. This translates into larger
regions where the optical conductivity behaves linearly due to the increased separation
between activation frequencies (see Fig. 5 (d)).
5. Feasibility for light dark matter detection
For a material with a linear dispersion to be a realistic candidate to detect light dark
matter (meV deposition energies) it is necessary to fulﬁll the following main criteria:
i) small gap (meV); ii) small Fermi velocity; iii) small photon screening at energies
close to the energy deposition range; and iv) scalable material growth. As we now
explain, our results indicate that Ag3AuSe2 meets the ﬁrst three criteria. The extent
to which they are met varies with the lattice constant and suggesting that realizing a
tunable detector is possible.
Regarding point i), if one is to detect dark matter with keV mass, it is necessary
that the band gap is of the order of the deposition energy ED ∼meV. Additionally
the detector should be kept at a temperature lower than this energy scale to reduce
undesired thermal noise.
As we have discussed, Ag3AuSe2 with diﬀerent lattice
constants, achieved by diﬀerent growth rates or hydrostatic pressures, can reach the
meV range, satisfying point i).
The scattering between dark matter and the target material is kinematically
constrained if the target velocity, the Fermi velocity, is faster than the largest possible
dark matter velocity [2], vmax ∼2.6 × 10−3c. From Fig. 3 it is already apparent that
the valence bands close to the Γ point are relatively ﬂat. More precisely, from Table
2 we see that all Fermi velocities are vF ∼10−4c < vmax, hence satisfying point ii).
The real part of the optical conductivity determines the absorption of the
material. As described in [2, 9] for the scattering amplitude between the incident
dark matter and the target to be large, it is beneﬁcial that the photon is not strongly
screened by the medium where it propagates, compared to a metal. This requirement
is satisﬁed for a narrow gap Dirac material because the real part of the optical
conductivity scales linearly with frequency [2, 35] and the imaginary part of the
dielectric tensor ϵ = 1+iσ/ω remains small as a function of frequency. For Ag3AuSe2
at 3% (see Fig.
5 (c)) the optical conductivity grows linear as well, resulting in
a dielectric constant that renders a small in-medium polarization for the photon, a
necessary condition for a large scattering rate, as listed in point iii).
Finally, a dark matter detector must be sensitive to a small number of counts
per year, for which the target material must be grown as large and pure as possible.
Currently we are not aware of whether it is possible to grow Ag3AuSe2 in large crystals

and defect free, yet we expect that our results should encourage experimental eﬀorts
in this direction.
The discussion regarding points i)-iii) above indicate that growing Ag3AuSe2
with diﬀerent lattice constants can screen diﬀerent, and possibly overlapping regions
of parameter space. Although a full analysis of the detection capabilities is out of
the scope of this work, the above discussion suggests that a detector that combines
diﬀerent samples of Ag3AuSe2 with diﬀerent lattice parameters can be useful to screen
diﬀerent ranges of dark matter masses.
6. Conclusion
In this work we have studied the band structure of chiral two narrow gap
semiconductors under pressure, Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2 as candidates for dark
matter detection for the ﬁrst time, as well as the optical conductivity for diﬀerent
values of lattice parameters of the most promising candidate, Ag3AuSe2. We found
that increasing the pressure decreases the Fermi velocity, and results in a larger gap.
As the pressure increases these band structure features translate into a slower change
of slope of the optical conductivity as the frequency increases, into a nearly linear
frequency dependence.
We showed that Ag3AuSe2 satisﬁes three important requirements to be a
candidate as a target material for light dark matter detection: a meV gap, shallow
Fermi velocities, and small absorption. Our work sets the basis for an in depth study
of the capabilities of Ag3AuSe2 as a light dark matter detector along the lines of
Ref. [2], that can consider ﬁnite momentum scattering and map the precise phase
space accessible to a detector based on this material.
Experimentally, the dark matter detector we envision follows similar design
principles to earlier detector proposals [2, 36, 5, 9].
An important requirement is
the growth of large and clean single crystals, placed under ground to screen against
undesired false positives [37]. For suﬃciently large cross sections, it may be necessary
to take into account scattering with the Earth that can prevent the dark matter
particle from reaching the detector [38].
For further details on the experimental
requirements we refer the reader to the recent review [37].
As a ﬁnal outlook, we note that the absence of mirror symmetries in these
materials allows them to present other interesting optical responses that are only
allowed in chiral space groups. These include the gyrotropic magnetic eﬀect, which
is the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it transverses the material, and a
quantized circular photogalvanic eﬀect, which is a photocurrent that grows linear in
time induced by circularly polarized light set by fundamental constants only [39].
In conclusion, we expect that our results wil encourage the growth of pure and
large Ag3AuSe2 crystals that can serve to study chiral optical phenomena and may
help to design scalable and tunable dark matter detectors in the future, based on the
changes in the band structure caused by diﬀerent lattice constants.
