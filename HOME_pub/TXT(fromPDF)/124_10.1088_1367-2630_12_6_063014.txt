Abstract.
A free-electron-like band has recently been observed in a monolayer
of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules on
Ag(111) by two-photon photoemission (Schwalb et al 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 101
146801) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (Temirov et al 2006 Nature 444
350). Using density functional theory calculations, we ﬁnd that the observed
free-electron-like band originates from the Shockley surface state band being
dramatically shifted up in energy by the interaction with the adsorbed molecules,
while it also acquires a substantial admixture with a molecular band.
Electronic states at the organic molecule–metal interface are of key importance for electronic
and opto-electronic applications since they inﬂuence electron transport across the interface
directly. These interface states are formed from the interaction between highly dispersive states
of the metal substrate and weakly dispersive states of the semiconducting organic molecular
layers. The molecular states at the interface shift, broaden and become partially populated or
depopulated upon interaction with the metal states. The effect of the organic molecular layers
on metal surface states such as the Shockley surface (SS) states on noble metal surfaces is less
clear and has recently attracted much attention from observations of dispersive interface states
in these systems.
In many cases, upon adsorption of organic molecules on gold and copper surfaces [1]–[6],
the SS states were observed from scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved
photoemission to experience small energy shifts. In some cases, the fate of the SS and the
origin of highly dispersive states turned out to be more complex. A dispersive hybrid band

was identiﬁed by STS at the interface between a monolayer of charge-transfer complexes on a
gold surface and was shown by density functional theory calculations to arise from a mixing of
metal and molecular states [7]. A free-electron-like band was identiﬁed by STS in a monolayer
of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules on the Ag(111) surface
and was attributed to originate from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the
PTCDA molecule [8]. This free-electron-like band was recently also identiﬁed in two-photon
photoemission experiments by Schwalb et al [9], who challenged the interpretation proposed
by Temirov et al [8]. Based on the observed short lifetime of electrons in this band, Schwalb
et al argued that this band corresponded to an upward shifted SS band by the interaction with
the molecular monolayer. Thus there is a need to carry out electronic structure calculations to
resolve this outstanding issue about the origin of the observed free-electron-like state.
In this paper, we present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic
structure of the PTCDA monolayer on an Ag(111) surface and show that the origin of the
observed free-electron-like state is an SS state that has been shifted up in energy from the
interaction with the molecular monolayer. We also ﬁnd that the observed free-electron state has
acquired character from the LUMO + 1 of the adsorbed molecule.
The electronic and geometric structures of the molecular monolayer on the metal
surface were determined from periodic DFT calculations using the projector augmented wave
method [10], as implemented in the plane-wave-based VASP code [11]. The surface unit cell of
the two structurally inequivalent PTCDA molecules adsorbed on an Ag(111) slab is described
in detail by Rohlﬁng et al [12]. The vacuum region is about 16.5 Å. The full geometry relaxation
of the molecular monolayer and the two outermost layers of the Ag slab was carried out
using a four-layer slab with a plane wave cutoff of 400 eV on a 6 × 4 × 1 k-point grid until
the forces acting on the ions were smaller in magnitude than 0.02 eV Å
−1. In order to have a
good description of the Shockley surface band, a 12-layer slab was used in the calculation of
the electronic states. This slab was obtained by adding eight layers of Ag atoms at their bulk
positions to the bottom of the structurally optimized four-layer slab.
Following the widely used Tersoff–Hamann approximation [13], the differential con-
ductance measured in STS experiments was approximated using the local density of states
(LDOS) calculated for the 12-layer slab at the position of the tip apex. The molecular orbital
projected density of states (MO-PDOS) was calculated by projecting the wave functions of
the full system onto the wave functions of the isolated monolayer kept in the same geometric
structure as for the adsorbed monolayer. The wave-vector-resolved LDOS and PDOS were
calculated along a line from the 0 point to the surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) boundary.
Supported by the ﬁndings of Rohlﬁng et al [12, 14], we used the local density
approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation functional. The generalized-gradient
approximation (GGA) was found to give too large a bonding distance for the perylene core of
about 3.5 Å and too weak a bonding of less than 0.1 eV per molecule. A recent study by Romaner
et al [15] showed that the inclusion of non-local interactions using a recently developed van der
Waals functional [16] in the DFT calculations increased the adsorption energy per molecule
to a more realistic value of about 2 eV, but gave also a very large bonding distance of about
3.5 Å. In contrast the LDA was found to give a bonding geometry in much better agreement
with standing x-ray diffraction data [17, 18]. The adsorption height of 2.8 Å and the adsorption
energy of 2.6 eV per molecule obtained in the LDA were shown to be in good agreement with
the corresponding results of 3.1 Å and 2.4 eV for the adsorption height and energy, respectively,
obtained from a more fundamental approach to weak adsorption. In this approach, the exact

frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) of the isolated PTCDA monolayer. In (a),
PDOS on the HOMO, LUMO, LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 are taken at the 0
point in the SBZ. The dashed and solid lines correspond to the projected DOS
of the two nearly degenerate MOs of the two molecules in the surface unit
cell. Their energies when aligning the vacuum levels of the isolated and the
adsorbed monolayer are indicated by vertical bars. The vertical arrow indicates
the position of the satellite peak in one of the LUMO + 1 states. The dispersion

exchange energy is combined with a random phase approximation for the correlation energy as
obtained from the adiabatic connection dissipation ﬂuctuation theorem [14].
Our calculated average height of the perylene cores above the surface is 2.76 Å and the
average relative height between the anhydride and carboxylic oxygen atoms is 0.24 Å; both
these heights are in good agreement with the corresponding values 2.67 and 0.24 Å obtained
by Rohlﬁng et al [12]. They used the SIESTA package, which is based on a localized basis set,
and the LDA. However, we ﬁnd the average height of the anhydride oxygen atoms to be 0.04 Å
below the average height of the perylene cores, rather than being 0.08 Å above it, as obtained
by Rohlﬁng et al [12].
The character of the electronic states of the adsorbed molecular monolayer on the Ag
surface is revealed by the calculated projected DOS on the frontier orbitals of the isolated
monolayer, shown in ﬁgure 1(a) at the 0 point in the SBZ. For the isolated monolayer, the
two inequivalent molecules in the surface unit cell result in two nearly degenerate bands for
each highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest (LUMO), second lowest (LUMO + 1)
and third lowest (LUMO + 2) unoccupied molecular orbitals. The energy splittings are only
about 0.1 eV at the 0 point in the SBZ and demonstrate that the direct interactions between
the molecules are small. Note that LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 are nearly degenerate and their
ordering is reversed and hence their labeling is reversed compared to that obtained by Rohlﬁng
et al [12].
Upon adsorption, the frontier orbitals shift down in energy and are broadened by the
interaction with the metal states. The HOMOs are largely unaffected and shifted down in energy

with about 0.41 eV. The two LUMOs broaden and become more or less fully occupied with
peak positions −0.32 and −0.21 eV being close to the measured peak positions of the P1 state
by STS [8]. This assignment is in agreement with previous studies [12]. Both the LUMO + 1s
and LUMO + 2s broaden appreciably and develop satellite structures but remain unoccupied. Of
particular note is the pronounced satellite peak at the energy of about 0.5 eV in the PDOS on
the LUMO + 1s.
The energy of this satellite peak in the PDOS at the 0 point is close to the onset of about
0.6 and 0.7 eV of the free-electron-like band (P2 state) observed in 2PPE [9] and STS [8],
respectively. We note that the energy increases slightly to 0.6 eV when using the GGA for
the geometry obtained in the LDA. Furthermore, this peak has a free-electron-like dispersion
away from the 0 point, as shown in ﬁgure 1(b) by the wave-vector-resolved PDOS on the two
LUMO + 1s in the SBZ. The calculated effective mass of 0.5me is close to the effective mass
of about 0.39me and 0.47me extracted from the observed FE band in 2PPE [9] and STS [8],
respectively. This close agreement between observed and calculated onsets and effective masses
suggests that the calculated FE band corresponds to the observed FE band. Note that in this case
of relatively delocalized states, the Kohn–Sham states should provide a reasonable zero-order
approximation of the one-electron addition spectrum probed by STS. Further support for this
assignment in the case of STS comes from a comparison of calculated LDOS with observed
STS spectra and images.
As shown in ﬁgure 2(a), the FE band identiﬁed in the PDOS on the LUMO + 1 also shows
up in the wave-vector-resolved LDOS, and this demonstrates that it should be observable in
STS. The assignment of the observed FE band to the calculated FE band is further corroborated
by the calculated LDOS image at the onset of the FE band corresponding to an energy of 0.50 eV
and the 0 point in the SBZ. This image is shown in ﬁgure 3(a) and is in good agreement with the
observed STS image (inset in ﬁgure 3(a) of [8]). At this tip apex–surface distance, this image
shows no nodal structure and does not resemble any MO of the PTCDA molecules. However,

and blue contours correspond to high and low LDOS, respectively. In (b), the H,

at a much closer distance of about 1.3 Å from the molecular monolayer, the calculated LDOS
image in ﬁgure 3(b) has a similar nodal structure to the orbital density of the LUMO + 1 state,
as expected from the strong overlap of the FE state with the LUMO + 1 state in the PDOS
(ﬁgure 1(a)). Only LUMO + 1 of the isolated molecule is totally symmetric among the frontier
orbitals (see LUMO + 2 in ﬁgure 3 of [12]) and can interact with the FE band at the 0 point.
On the bare side of the slab, the SS state band is clearly identiﬁed in the wave-vector-
resolved LDOS (ﬁgure 2(b)). In this calculation, the onset of this SS band is somewhat below
the observed value of about −0.06 eV [19] and the calculated effective mass of about 0.36me is
close to the measured value of about 0.40me [19].
The strong overlap of the FE band with one of the LUMO + 1 (ﬁgures 2 and 3) suggests
that LUMO + 1 is directly involved in the formation of the FE band as proposed by Temirov
et al [8]. A direct measure of the overlap is given by the integrated strength of the PDOS over
the FE state. This strength is about 0.35 and is a substantial fraction of the total integrated
strength of unity of the PDOS of the particular LUMO + 1. Note that the two LUMO + 1 states
of the two molecules in the surface unit cell form in-phase and out-of-phase combinations. Only
the in-phase combination has an overlap with the free-electron state at the 0 point. The strong
overlap of the FE band with the in-phase combination of the LUMO + 1 is further illustrated in
the orbital density of this band at the 0 point in the SBZ shown in ﬁgure 4. The orbital density
decays slowly into the bulk and the density of the π orbitals of the LUMO + 1 state shows up as
two peaks on either side of the perylene core.
The alternative proposal by Schwalb et al [9] that the FE band originates from the SS band
of the bare surface has been investigated by calculating the evolution of the FE band with the
vertical height of the molecular monolayer from the surface. In ﬁgure 5, we depict the wave-
vector-resolved LDOS as a function of a rigid outward shift 1z of the molecular monolayer from
its vertical equilibrium distance. The FE band shifts rapidly down in energy with increasing 1z.
At 1z = 0.5 Å, the onset has already shifted down to about 0.1 eV above the Fermi energy and
approaches the onset of the SS. Furthermore, the dispersion increases somewhat with increasing

with the height of the molecular monolayer shows that the FE band corresponds to an SS band
shifted upwards in energy by the interaction of the Ag surface with the adsorbed monolayer and
acquiring an admixture with the LUMO + 1.

states are included. The average energies of the PDOS are indicated by vertical
bars. The states were broadened by 0.1 eV.
A more detailed understanding of the interaction of the LUMO + 1 with the SS state is
revealed by the behavior shown in ﬁgure 6 of the projected DOS on this state at the 0 point of
the SBZ as a function of the vertical distance of the monolayer from its equilibrium position.
Upon the interaction of the PTCDA monolayer with the Ag surface, the LUMO + 1 broadens
and its average energy shifts down in energy with decreasing vertical distance. Only at a very
close distance of 0.25 Å does the LUMO + 1 start to develop a signiﬁcant overlap with the SS
at 0.3 eV, which increases dramatically at the equilibrium distance with a concomitant dramatic
downward shift of its average energy. Furthermore, this shows that the covalent interaction
between the SS band and the LUMO + 1 band does not govern the upward shift of the SS band.
Such an interaction alone would give rise to a level repulsion. The upward shift must then be
caused by making the one-electron potential more repulsive for the SS band in a similar manner
to the mechanism proposed by Schwalb et al [9].
In conclusion, we have shown from a density functional theory study that the observed free-
electron band in STS and in two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectroscopy of an adsorbed
monolayer of PTCDA molecules on an Ag(111) surface originates from the Shockley surface
state being dramatically shifted up in energy by interaction with the adsorbed molecules.
The band acquires also a substantial admixture with the LUMO + 1 bands of the molecular
monolayer. This ﬁnding shows that the metal surface states play an important role in forming
dispersive states at the metal–organic interface. Furthermore, upon adsorption of a ﬁlm of
PTCDA molecules, the overlap of the surface band with the LUMO + 1 band in the adlayer has
important implications for the level alignment of the valence and conduction bands of the ﬁlm
with respect to the metal states and hence also for the electron transport across the metal–organic
interface.
