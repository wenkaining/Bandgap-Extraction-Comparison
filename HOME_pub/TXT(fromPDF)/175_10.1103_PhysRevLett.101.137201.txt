A surface magnetoelectric effect is revealed by density-functional calculations that are applied to
ferromagnetic Fe(001), Ni(001), and Co(0001) ﬁlms in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld. The
effect originates from spin-dependent screening of the electric ﬁeld which leads to notable changes in the
surface magnetization and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These results are of considerable
interest in the area of electrically controlled magnetism and magnetoelectric phenomena.

The coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
order parameters in thin-ﬁlm heterostructures is an exciting
new frontier in nanoscale science [1–5]. The underlying
physical phenomenon controlling the properties of such
materials is the magnetoelectric (ME) effect [6,7] that
determines the induction of magnetization by an electric
ﬁeld or electric polarization by a magnetic ﬁeld. The recent
interest in ME materials is stimulated by their signiﬁcant
technological potential. A prominent example is the con-
trol of the ferromagnetic state by an electric ﬁeld [8,9].
This phenomenon could yield entirely new device con-
cepts, such as electric ﬁeld-controlled magnetic data stor-
age. In a broader vision, ME effects include not only the
coupling between the electric and magnetic polarizations,
but also related phenomena such as an electrically con-
trolled exchange bias [10,11] and magnetocrystalline an-
isotropy [12–14], and the effect of ferroelectricity on spin
transport [15–19].
Two mechanisms for the ME effect have been estab-
lished: (1) in single-phase ME materials (including multi-
ferroics) an external electric ﬁeld displaces ions from
equilibrium positions which changes the magnetostatic
and exchange interactions affecting the magnetization
[20]; (2) in composite multiferroic materials, piezoelectric
strain in the ferroelectric constituent of the multiferroic
heterostructure induces changes in the magnetic properties
of the ferromagnetic constituent due to magnetostriction
[9,13,14]. Recently, two additional mechanisms for mag-
netoelectricity have been proposed theoretically: (1) in a
heterostructure comprising a ferroelectric insulator and a
magnetic material, ferroelectric displacements of atoms at
the interface may be reversed by an external electric ﬁeld
resulting in the sizable change of the interface magnetic
moment [21] and surface (interface) magnetic anisotropy
[22]; (2) in the insulator-ferromagnetic heterostructure, an
external electric ﬁeld polarizes the insulator resulting in the
carrier-mediated interface magnetoelectricity [23].
In this study we explore the ME effect due to the direct
inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld on magnetic proper-
ties of ferromagnetic Fe(001), Ni(001), and Co(0001)
ﬁlms. We show that spin-dependent screening of the elec-
tric ﬁeld leads to spin imbalance of the excess surface
charge resulting in notable changes in the surface magne-
tization and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We
argue that the effect may be used to switch the magneti-
zation between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations,
thereby signifying the potential of electrically controlled
magnetism.
When a metal ﬁlm is exposed to an electric ﬁeld, the
conduction electrons screen the electric ﬁeld over the
screening length of the metal. In ferromagnetic metals,
the screening charge is spin-dependent due to exchange
interactions [24]. The spin dependence of the screening
electrons leads to the induced surface magnetization of the
ferromagnet, i.e., the ME effect. Since the electric ﬁeld
does not penetrate into the bulk of metals and the induced
electric charge is conﬁned to a depth of the order of atomic
dimensions from the surface, this ME effect is limited to
the metal surface. Therefore we name it a surface magneto-
electric effect.
To elucidate the surface magnetoelectric effect quanti-
tatively we carry out density-functional calculations on
free-standing ferromagnetic ﬁlms under the inﬂuence of a
uniform electric ﬁeld applied perpendicular to the ﬁlm
surface. The studied systems are bcc Fe(001) (a ¼
2:87 A), hcp Co(0001) (a ¼ 2:51 A, c=a ¼ 1:622), and
fcc Ni(001) (a ¼ 3:52 A) ﬁlms with thicknesses ranging
from 1 to 15 monolayers (MLs). The calculations are based
on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method imple-
mented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[25] and include spin-orbit interactions. The exchange-
correlation potential is treated in the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA). We use the energy cutoff of 500 eV
for the plane wave expansion of the PAWs and a 10  10 
1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for k-point sampling in the self-
consistent calculations. All the structural relaxations are
performed until the Hellman-Feynman forces on the re-
laxed atoms become less than 1 meV= A. The external

 2008 The American Physical Societyelectric ﬁeld is introduced by planar dipole layer method
[26].
Results of our calculations demonstrate that magnetic
moments do change under applied electric ﬁeld. As ex-
pected, the magnetoelectric effect is almost solely a surface
effect and has little dependence on ﬁlm thickness. Figure 1
shows the calculated magnetic moment on the surface Fe
atom of a free-standing 15-ML Fe (001) ﬁlm as a function
of an applied electric ﬁeld for magnetization lying in the
plane of the ﬁlm ([100] direction) and perpendicular to the
plane ([001] direction). The spin and orbital contributions
to the total moment are of the order of 3.0 and 0:1B,
respectively. It is seen that the magnetic moment changes
nearly linearly with the electric ﬁeld, so that the induced
surface magnetization M depends on the applied electric
ﬁeld E as follows:
0M ¼ SE;
(1)
where S denotes the surface magnetoelectric coefﬁcient.
Here a positive electric ﬁeld is deﬁned to be pointed away
from the metal ﬁlm surface. Therefore results for both
positive and negative electric ﬁelds are obtained at two
surfaces within one simulation. From the linear ﬁt to the
calculated data shown in Fig. 1 we ﬁnd that for magneti-
zation in the plane 100

2:9  1014 G cm2=V. The vertical separation between
the two lines in Fig. 1 for a given applied electric ﬁeld is
the difference in the orbital moments in the two magneti-
zation directions (as shown later in Fig. 4) because the
corresponding spin moments are essentially the same.
The origin of this ME effect stems from induced spin-
dependent charge densities on the surfaces of the ﬁlm.
Figure 2 displays the differences in the charge densities
between the disturbed (E ¼ 1:0 V= A) and undisturbed
(E ¼ 0) Fe ﬁlm. It is seen that the surface dipoles are
formed to screen the electric ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm and the
induced charge density is strongly spin-polarized. We note
the presence of the Friedel-like oscillation of the change
density in Fig. 2, which is typical for the electron screening
effect [27]. However, unlike the case of normal metals
[26], the charge oscillations have multiple periods, and
the oscillations of the majority- and minority-spin elec-
trons are different. This is because the majority- and
minority-spin electrons have different Fermi wave vectors,
and they are coupled in the dielectric response [24].
Because of the spin imbalance of the screening charge,
there is an induced surface magnetization reﬂecting the
presence of the surface ME effect. Figure 3 visualizes the
induced spin density across the Fe ﬁlm. It is clearly seen
that the ME effect is conﬁned to the surfaces of the ﬁlm.
The net induced spin densities at the two opposite surfaces
have different signs, as the applied electric ﬁelds are op-
positely oriented with respect to the two surfaces of the
ﬁlm.
It is interesting to compare the calculated magnitude of
the surface ME coefﬁcient due to the direct inﬂuence of an
external electric ﬁeld with those predicted earlier for
BaTiO3=Fe [21] and SrTiO3=SrRuO3 structures [23]. In
the later case, the ME effect originates from the capacitive
accumulation
of
spin-polarized
carriers
at
the
SrTiO3=SrRuO3 interface under an external electric ﬁeld.
The calculations of Ref. [23] suggest that for a 7 unit cell
thick SrTiO3 (a ¼ 3:904 A) layer the applied voltage of
27.8 mV induces a net magnetic moment of 2:5  103B
per surface unit cell. The corresponding surface ME coef-
ﬁcient is S  2  1012 G cm2=V. This value is higher
by 2 orders of magnitude than what we obtained for Fe
ﬁlm. This difference is related to the dielectric constant of
the dielectric at the dielectric/metal interface. For a given
applied electric ﬁeld, the screening charge in the metal is
proportional to the dielectric constant. According to
Ref. [17], SrTiO3 has a very large dielectric constant,

Therefore, the presence of a dielectric with large dielectric
constant can signiﬁcantly amplify the surface ME effect.
In the case of BaTiO3=Fe structure [21], the predicted
ME effect occurs as a result of the reversal of the polar-
ization orientation due to an applied electric ﬁeld and
originates from the change in the interface bonding
strength which dominates over the screening charge con-
tribution. This ME effect is strongly nonlinear and does not
follow a simple relation given by Eq. (1). Nevertheless, to
have a crude estimate of the surface ME coefﬁcient we
assume that the polarization of BaTiO3 can be switched at
the coercive ﬁeld of Ec ¼ 100 kV=cm resulting in the
change of the interface magnetic moment of more than
0:3B per unit surface cell. We ﬁnd that the surface ME
coefﬁcient is then s  2  1010 G cm2=V. This value is
much larger than the electric-ﬁeld-induced effects dis-
cussed above.
Calculations performed for magnetic Co (0001) and Ni

ﬁlm. Note that the predicted surface ME coefﬁcients have
the same sign for the three kinds of metal ﬁlms. This is in
disagreement with the prediction of Ref. [24] suggesting
that Fe ﬁlm has different sign of the induced magnetic
moment from that in Co and Ni ﬁlms. Obviously a simple
free-electron-like model adopted in Ref. [24] is unable to
take into account all the electronic effects which occur in
the 3d metals due to the presence of the exchange-splitting
d bands, their hybridizations with s and p bands, and the
difference between bulk and surface electronic structures.
The origin of the predicted positive ME coefﬁcient for
all the ferromagnetic ﬁlms can be understood within a
simple model. The model assumes a localization of the
screening charge within the ﬁrst atomic ML on the metal
surface and a rigid shift of the chemical potential on the
surface in response to the applied electric ﬁeld E.

Here n" and n# are majority- and minority-spin surface
DOS at the Fermi energy and " is the dielectric constant
of the dielectric adjacent to the ferromagnetic surface (in
our case of vacuum " ¼ 1). As is seen from Eq. (2), s is
proportional to the spin polarization of the surface DOS. It
is known that at the Fe (001), Co(0001), and Ni(001)
surfaces, the minority-spin states are dominant near the
Fermi level [28]. Therefore the accumulation of electrons
in response to the application of an inward (negative)
electric ﬁeld results in a decrease of the surface spin mo-
ment, due to the dominating minority-spin character at the
Fermi energy. Using Eq. (2) and the calculated surface
DOS, we ﬁnd S  5:2, 4.9, and 5:5  1014 G cm2=V
for Fe (001), Co (0001), and Ni (001), respectively.
These values are in a qualitative agreement with the results
of our density-functional calculations.
Another important consequence of applying electric
ﬁeld to the ferromagnetic metal ﬁlms is the change of their
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), which may
be considered as another manifestation of the ME effect.
The MAE, whose physical origin is the spin-orbit coupling
[29], plays an important role in high anisotropy materials
used in modern magnetic storage technologies [30].
Recently we have demonstrated that the magnetic anisot-
ropy of the ferromagnetic ﬁlm can be altered by switching
the polarization of the adjacent ferroelectric through ap-
plied bias voltage [22]. The effect occurs due to the change
of the electronic structure at the interface region, which is
produced by ferroelectric displacements and mediated by
interface bonding. Here we demonstrate the direct impact
of an external electric ﬁeld on the MAE.
Following our previous study [22], we decompose the
MAE for the whole ﬁlm into individual contributions from
FIG. 3 (color online).

137201-3each constituent atom. By doing this, we ﬁnd that the MAE
changes for the ferromagnetic ﬁlm under various electric
ﬁelds, again, mainly occur at the surface. To be speciﬁc, an
outward (positive) electric ﬁeld enhances and an inward
(negative) electric ﬁeld reduces the individual MAE con-
tribution from surface atoms. As is seen from Fig. 4, the
orbital moment anisotropy (ML½001  ML½100) of the
surface Fe atoms increases monotonically with the increase
of applied electric ﬁeld. This leads to a signiﬁcant increase
of the surface MAE when the electric ﬁeld changes from
inward (negative) to outward (positive) direction, evident
from Fig. 4. In particular, when the electric ﬁeld of
0:5 V= A switches from negative to positive, there is a
change of about 30% in the surface MAE.
The predicted phenomenon can be used for switching
the magnetization by an applied electric ﬁeld. The total
magnetic anisotropy energy per unit area of the ﬁlm in-
volves the magnetostatic shape anisotropy energy Km ¼
2M2t, where M is the magnetization and t is ﬁlm
thickness. The shape anisotropy favors in-plane alignment
of magnetization, whereas positive MAE favors out-of-
plane alignment. Thus, with the ME control of the surface
magnetocrystalline anisotropy and thickness dependent
shape anisotropy, it is possible to design ferromagnetic
ﬁlms with the anisotropy switchable between in-plane
and out-of-plane orientations.
The predicted ME effects in ferromagnetic metal ﬁlms
are signiﬁcant only when the applied ﬁeld is very large,
e.g., of a few hundred mV= A. However, such strong elec-
tric ﬁelds could be achieved experimentally using a scan-
ning tunneling microscope tip over the magnetic metal ﬁlm
surface. Since the screening effect can be dramatically
enhanced by high- dielectrics, the applied electric ﬁeld
could be much smaller to have observable effects on the
related devices.
To summarize, our ﬁrst-principle calculations show that
the surface magnetoelectric effect exists in ferromagnetic
metal ﬁlms due to spin-dependent screening of electric
ﬁeld at the metal surfaces. The external electric ﬁeld
induces notable changes in the surface magnetization and
the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy of a ferromag-
netic metal. The magnitude and sign of the surface mag-
netoelectric coefﬁcient depends on the density and spin
polarization of the charge carriers near the Fermi level of
the ferromagnetic metal ﬁlm. This purely electric ﬁeld
driven magnetoelectric effect may be interesting for appli-
cation in advanced magnetic and electronic devices.
