We study tunneling magnetothermopower (TMTP) in CoFeB=MgO=CoFeB magnetic tunnel junction
nanopillars. Thermal gradients across the junctions are generated by an electric heater line. Thermopower
voltages up to a few tens of V between the top and bottom contact of the nanopillars are measured which
scale linearly with the applied heating power and hence the thermal gradient. The thermopower signal
varies by up to 10 V upon reversal of the relative magnetic conﬁguration of the two CoFeB layers from
parallel to antiparallel. This signal change corresponds to a large spin-dependent Seebeck coefﬁcient of
the order of 100 V=K and a large TMTP change of the tunnel junction of up to 90%.

Transport coefﬁcients in ferromagnetic materials are
spin dependent [1]. The giant [2] and the tunneling [3]
magnetoresistance (TMR) are the most prominent ex-
amples of spin-dependent electronic transport. Their dis-
covery boosted spintronics [4] with important applications,
e.g., in data storage. While spintronics relies on spin-
dependent charge transport also spin-dependent heat trans-
port can become important when, e.g., a high current
density in magnetic nanodevices creates a signiﬁcant tem-
perature gradient. The combination and coupling of heat,
charge, and spin currents in magnetic nanostructures has
recently opened a highly active line of research now re-
ferred to as spin caloritronics [5] with important discov-
eries such as the spin-Seebeck effect [6] or thermally
driven spin injection [7]. Furthermore, thermal spin trans-
fer torque was predicted to enable highly efﬁcient magne-
tization reversal in magnetic nanodevices by thermal
gradients [8–10] and ﬁrst experimental evidence has re-
cently been provided [11].
For spintronics CoFeB=MgO=CoFeB magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJ) are one of the most attractive systems as
they can be reliably produced by sputter deposition [12]
and show very high TMR ratios. The latter results from the
half-metallic character of the coherently tunneling 1
states in the ferromagnetic electrodes [13]. With respect
to spin caloritronics applications recent ab initio studies
also predicted very high spin-dependent Seebeck coefﬁ-
cients of 150 V=K and correspondingly high tunneling
magnetothermopower (TMTP) ratios of the MTJ [14].
Furthermore magnon-assisted tunneling might contribute
to TMTP especially in nanosized, mesoscopic MTJs [15].
An experimental conﬁrmation of these predictions would
strongly impact materials research in the ﬁeld of spin
caloritronics.
Here, we experimentally study TMTP in CoFeB=
MgO=CoFeB nanopillars under thermal gradients across
the MTJ. We ﬁnd a strong increase of the thermopower
voltage VTP upon reversal of the magnetic conﬁguration of
the two CoFeB layers from parallel to antiparallel. The
measured increase of VTP up to 10 V corresponds to large
spin-dependent Seebeck coefﬁcients of the order of
100 V=K and to large TMTP ratios of the MTJ of 90%
making this material system a highly attractive candidate
for spin caloritronic applications.
The MTJ stacks are sputter deposited in a Singulus NDT
Timaris cluster tool on a Si wafer capped with 100 nm
SiO2. The MTJ stack consists of a bottom contact (BC) of
3 nm Ta=90 nm Cu=5 nm Ta, a pinned layer (PL) stack
comprising
a
synthetic
antiferromagnet
of
20
nm
PtMn=2 nm Co60Fe20B20=0:75 nmRu=2 nmCo60Fe20B20,
the 1.5 nm MgO tunnel junction, the free layer (FL) of
3 nm Co60Fe20B20, and a top contact of 10 nm Ta=30 nm
Cu=8 nm Ru. The completed stack is annealed for 90 min
at 360 C in 1 T ﬁeld and lithographically patterned into
160  320 nm2 wide elliptic nanopillars. An electron mi-
crograph of a typical device is shown in Fig. 1(b).
Electrical top contacts (TC1-TC3) to the MTJ nanopillars
(position of MTJ marked for TC2) are provided by electron
beam lithography and lift-off. To apply thermal gradients a
5 m wide and 70 nm thick Au heater line (HL) is pat-
terned on top of the nanopillar and is separated from the TC
by a 160 nm thick Ta2O5 dielectric. The 10 m wide BC
line is running underneath the HL. It acts as a heat sink to
establish a well-deﬁned temperature gradient across the
MTJ. Figure 1(c) sketches a cross section of the contact
and layer structure along the dashed line in (b). The nano-
pillars show single domain magnetization reversal with
uniaxial anisotropies between 8 mT  0Hk  15 mT,
TMR ratios between 70% and 140%, and resistance area
products of the order of 17  m2 [16].
We characterize the spin caloric properties of our MTJ
nanopillars by magnetothermo electrical measurements.
Such measurements have been used to characterize, e.g.,
magnetic multilayers [17], nanowires [18], and granular

 2011 American Physical Societysystems [19–21]. The experimental setup is sketched in
Fig. 1(a). Static ﬁelds up to 0HS ¼ 60 mT are applied in
arbitrary in-plane orientations. Thermal gradients across
the MTJ are generated by applying ac or dc heater currents
up to Iheat ¼ 60 mA through the HL while VTP between
BC and TC of one of the MTJs is measured. In our
measurements a positive VTP corresponds to a positive
voltage at the TC. For dc heater currents VTP is measured
by a nanovoltmeter. For ac measurements at ac heater
frequencies of 10. . .80 Hz VTP is measured by a lock-in
detection at the second harmonic. Note that Iheat also
generates an easy axis ﬁeld Hheat. For dc measurements
Hheat is compensated by an external easy axis ﬁeld HX
whereas for ac measurements such compensation is not
possible in our present setup. Hence while ac experiments
allow determining VTP with better signal-to-noise ratio the
measured VTPðHSÞ will always be averaged over an oscil-
lating easy axis ﬁeld Hheat of up to 6 mT.
Figure 2(a) shows an easy axis TMR loop (black circles)
of one of the MTJ nanopillars (MTJ-3 in Table I). The
TMR is measured at a current bias of 100 A in easy axis
ﬁelds up to 0HX ¼ 25 mT. The TMR change of 110%
occurs at the reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP)
orientation of the magnetization of the 3 nm thick CoFeB
free layer (FL) with respect to the pinned layer (PL)
magnetization. In our experiments the PL magnetization
is always oriented along the positive x direction. Note that
the sharp jumps of the TMR at the coercive ﬁelds H
C and
Hþ
C speak for a single domain reversal behavior of the MTJ
FL which is conﬁrmed by well deﬁned switching asteroids
in combined easy axis and hard axis ﬁelds [not shown;
compare Ref. [16], Fig. 1(b) for a typical result].
The second curve in Fig. 2(a) (red triangles) is a TMR
loop taken for Iheat ¼ 38 mA. Here, the effect of Hheat is
visible and H
C and Hþ
C are both offset by about 3.5 mT to
positive HX. Measurements of the coercive ﬁeld offsets
H
C , Hþ
C up to Iheat ¼ 60 mA show a linear scaling of
Hheat with Iheat with a slope of about 0:1 mT=mA (not
shown). Note that no signiﬁcant reduction of HC with
Iheat during heating is found in the applied current range
and thermally activated reversal can be neglected.
Figure 2(b) shows three typical dc measurements of VTP
of the same device. VTP is displayed for heater powers Pheat
of 21, 38, and 58 mW as function of the easy axis ﬁeld HX.
Hheat is compensated by a static ﬁeld offset. For all three

177201-2curves VTPðPÞ in the P state is lower than VTPðAPÞ in the
AP state with a maximum difference of VTP  11 V.
This yields an average TMTP ratio of the given device of
TMTP ¼ VTP=VTPðPÞ  32%.
Figure 3(a) shows the typical dependence of VTPðP; APÞ
on Pheat. dc and ac data agree. Measurements were per-
formed at 0HX ¼ 30 mT in well-deﬁned P and AP
conﬁgurations. VTPðPÞ, VTPðAPÞ both scale linearly with
Pheat and hence with the temperature gradient TMTJ
across the MTJ. In Fig. 3(b) the TMTP ratio derived
from the same data is plotted vs Pheat. The ac data yield
a constant TMTP of about 32% (full squares). Here, ac
measurements have only been carried out up to Pheat ¼
34 mW. Note that the TMTP derived from ac measure-
ments is typically constant over the whole power range
displayed in the ﬁgure. Also the TMTP derived from dc
measurements (open squares) is constant for Pheat 
20 mW with a comparable TMTP  29%. The lower
TMTP for Pheat  20 mW in the dc data can be attributed
to an artifact resulting from uncompensated voltage offsets
of the nanovoltmeter which are signiﬁcant at low Pheat.
Comparison of our data to the predicted high spin-
dependent Seebeck coefﬁcients requires estimating the
temperature
gradient
TMTJ
over
the
MgO
MTJ.
Therefore the HL resistance RHL is measured as a function
of Pheat [Fig. 3(c)]. From the increase of RHL with Pheat the
increase of the HL temperature THLðPheatÞ can be derived
by RHL ¼ RHL;0 (1 þ  	 THL), where RHL;0 is the resist-
ance at room temperature (Pheat ¼ 0 mW). The HL
temperature coefﬁcient  ¼ ð2:5  0:3Þ  103 K1 was
determined using a variable temperature probe station and
agrees with literature values obtained for similar geometry
[22]. THLðPheatÞ is plotted as red triangles in Fig. 3(c). For
maximum Pheat ¼ 60 mW a maximum THL ð243Þ K
is found. In parallel no change of resistance of the BC line
and hence of the BC temperature was observed. THL thus
represents a good estimate of the temperature drop be-
tween HL and BC. Based on this the temperature distribu-
tion over the nanopillar structure is computed using a
commercial ﬁnite element solver [23]. We use a two di-
mensional model of the pillar structure including contacts
and insulating layers with thermal material parameters
based on literature values [22–25]. The simulations show
that the dominant temperature drop occurs across the
160 nm dielectric between HL and TC. In Fig. 1(d) the
temperature proﬁle in the nanopillar around the MgO
barrier is plotted as function of layer thickness t
(z direction). t ¼ 0 corresponds to the bottom of the lowest
CoFeB layer of the PL. For the given maximum Pheat ¼
60 mW one ﬁnds a temperature drop across the MgO
barrier of TMTJ  45 mK. Based on this one can estimate
a spin-dependent Seebeck coefﬁcient of the MTJ of
SMTJ ¼ VTP=TMTJ  230 V=K comparable to the
predicted value of 150 V=K [14]. Note, however, that
due to the large uncertainty of TMTJ resulting from the
simulation (e.g., due to the partial use of bulk values for the
thermal conductivity of thin ﬁlms) only an order of mag-
nitude estimate of SMTJ is feasible.
The above ab initio studies of TMTP in MgO based
MTJs have also considered the angular dependence of VTP
[14]. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show the measured angular
dependence of (c) TMR and (d) VTP for a 360 in-plane
rotation of the FL magnetization induced by a rotating
static ﬁeld HS. VTP is measured with ac heater current.
VTP well follows the typical cosð  Þ dependence of
the TMR [26]. In the TMR two jumps are found around
  90 when the free layer magnetization overcomes
the hard axis. In VTP these jumps are smoothed out by
the uncompensated ac heater ﬁeld of 6 mT. Note that the
measured angular dependence does not well follow the
theoretical prediction of an almost constant VTP for jj <
120 and a sharp increase near the AP orientation [14].
In contrast both in collinear and tilted ﬁeld conﬁgurations
of FL and PL VTP basically follows the ﬁeld dependence of
the TMR.
As listed in Table I our samples reveal TMTP ratios
between 17% and 42% and TMR ratios between 79% and
140%. In the inset to Fig. 3(b) the TMTP ratios of the
different samples are plotted vs TMR. No signiﬁcant cor-
relation of the amplitude of TMR and TMTP is found. The
TMTP rather seems to scatter around a value of about 31%.
Theoretically no close correlation of the TMR and TMTP
ratio is expected. While the TMR is sensitive to the density
of states (DOS) of the two spin channels at the Fermi level
FIG. 3 (color online).

177201-3the TMTP is sensitive to the asymmetry of the DOS [14].
Note that VTP and hence the above TMTP ratios also
contain contributions of all nonmagnetic layers of the
devices. To determine these the MgO barriers of some
devices were shortened by pinholes [27] by application
of current stress resulting in a ﬁeld independent resistance
of 50 . Figure 2(b) also shows VTP;short of the shortened
MTJ-3 for Pheat ¼ 58 mW (dashed line). VTP;short is inde-
pendent of ﬁeld conﬁrming the origin of TMTP at the
MgO MTJ. Subtracting this background from VTPðPÞ
yields a better estimate of the TMTP contribution of
the CoFeB=MgO=CoFeB MTJ. The resulting values of
TMTPMTJ ¼ VTP=ðVTPðPÞ  VTP;shortÞ
of,
e.g.,
72%
(MTJ-2) and 90% (MTJ-3) are signiﬁcantly higher than
listed in Table I.
Concluding we have observed a large TMTP of up to
90% in MgO=CoFeB MTJs making them a promising
candidate
for
spin
caloritronics.
SMTJ
agrees
with
ab initio predictions while deviations from the predicted
angular dependence are found [14]. For all devices
VTPðAPÞ was larger than VTPðPÞ in agreement with ab inito
theory and with predictions based on magnon-assisted
tunneling [15]. Here, temperature dependent experiments
could shine light on the origin of the TMTP as a strong
temperature dependence of SMTJ has been predicted by
ab initio theory [14].
