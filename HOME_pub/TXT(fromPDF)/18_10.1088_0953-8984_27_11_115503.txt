Abstract
The results of the electronic structure calculations performed on SmN by using the LDA+U
method with and without including the spin–orbit coupling are presented. Within the LDA+U
approach, a N(2p) band polarization of about 0.3 µB is induced by Sm(4f )-N(2p)
hybridization, and a half-metallic ground state is obtained. By including spin–orbit coupling
the magnetic structure was shown to be antiferromagnetic of type II, with Sm spin and orbital
moments nearly cancelling. This results into a semiconducting ground state, which is in
agreement with experimental results.

1. Introduction
Rare-earth nitrides (RN) show a wide range of physical
properties, despite having the same crystal structure with very
close lattice constants and similar electronic structures. The
structural, magnetic and electronic properties of rare-earth
monopnictides were reviewed recently [1, 2]. In these reviews
it was emphasized that the experimental data on the rare-
earth monopnictides are rather scattered, and often lead to
contradicting results, due to difﬁculties in obtaining samples of
good quality. Thus, controversies concerning their electronic
structure, transport and magnetic properties exist in literature.
In the same reviews [1, 2] the results of different electronic
structure calculations of RN compounds were also compared.
The description of the strongly correlated 4f states within the
band theory is shown to require methods which go beyond
density functional theory (DFT) in the standard local spin
density approximation (LSDA). Band structure calculations
were performed on the entire RN series using the self-
interaction correction (SIC) method [3–5], and the LSDA+U
method [6–8]. For the latter, considering U corrections for
4f bands only was shown to lead to a half-metallic ground
state [7, 9]. If also the 5d states are corrected with a local
U term, the electronic structure of some RN turns out to be
semiconducting, as shown for example for GdN [7].
SmN was reported to be an antiferromagnet having the
N´eel temperature TN of 13 K [10] or 15 K [11]. From speciﬁc
heat measurements an ordering temperature TN of 18.2 K
was reported
[12].
No evidence of magnetic order was
shown for T
⩾1.6 K by neutron diffraction experiments
[13]. A magnetic transition around 27 K was reported recently
by Preston et al [14].
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
experiements has been also performed to study the 4f -spins
alignment [15] in addition to the susceptibility studies in
0953-8984/15/115503+07$33.00

the paramagnetic phase [16]. The rather wide range of the
reported ordering temperatures can be correlated with the
compositions of the samples. The nitrogen vacancy lowers
the N´eel temperature, as in the case of GdN [17]. It was
argued that SmN is likely to be in fact a metamagnet, however
even in an applied ﬁeld of µ0H = 6 T, the low temperature
moment was smaller than 0.1 µB. The transport properties
were also studied.
A semimetallic behaviour of SmN was
initially reported [18]. Later on, SmN was shown to be a
semiconductor with a band gap of 0.7 eV [19]. Preston et al
[14] conﬁrmed experimentally that in the studied temperature
range (T ⩽150 K) SmN shows a semiconducting behaviour.
Here we report the electronic and magnetic structure
of SmN by using an LDA+U+SO approach.
Several self-
consistent solutions for different values of the parameter U
exist in both ferro and anti-ferromagnetic conﬁgurations of
the samarium moments.
We discuss the energy difference
between these self-consistent solutions and show that the
ground state structure is that of an AF of type II according
to Smart’s classiﬁcation [20] with vanishing moments and
semiconducting in agreement with experimental results. In
our calculations we have used several implementations. The
most of our results have been obtained with the tight-binding
linear mufﬁn-tin orbitals (LMTO) method, in the atomic sphere
approximation (ASA), by means of the code LMTO47 [21].
For sake of completeness we performed several calculations by
means of the full-potential (FP) LMTO code RSPt [22–24] and
by means of the FP linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW)
code FLEUR [25]. All these implementations include the on-
site Coulomb interaction at the level of LSDA+U [26]. The +U
contribution on the top of the LSDA represents the additional
intra-atomic Hubbard repulsion among the localized electrons,
treated self-consistently in a mean-ﬁeld (‘Hartree–Fock’) way.
Used under appropriate conditions this contribution produces
the correct insulating ground state for several systems where
the standard LSDA band theory fails. All implementations
used here consider the most general form of LSDA+U, where
theinteractionvertexisparametrizedwithafullspinandorbital
rotationally invariant 4-index U-matrix [26, 27]. The addition
of a Hubbard U interaction term in the energy functional, also
introduces the need for a ‘double-counting’ correction. The
latter accounts for the fact that the Coulomb energy is already
included (although not correctly) in the LSDA functional.
The double-counting scheme is unfortunately not uniquely
deﬁned, and usually creates some ambiguity in the LSDA+U
method [28, 29]. Here we adopt the so-called fully localized
limit (FLL) double counting [26, 28, 30] which is suitable for
strongly localized 4f electrons. It is crucial for the present
study to consider the corrections due to the spin–orbit (SO)
coupling self-consistently. We refer to these calculations in
the followings with the acronym LSDA+U+SO [31]. More
details on the construction of the local orbitals to supplement
with the Hubbard U term can be found in the references above.
Concerning the strenght of U, instead, we note that a direct
evaluation of the average Coulomb and exchange integrals
in terms of Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients and Slater integrals
usually produces unrealistically large values. For this reason
Larson et al in [7] scaled the values of the Slater–Coulomb
integrals so that they ﬁt the positions of the 4f -orbitals in
Gd pnictides. The same semi-empirical screening has been
applied to SmN, and produced the values U = 8.22 eV and
J
= 1.07 eV. Given that their study represents the most
thourough and systematic computational work on the RN up
to now, for sake of comparison we have used the same values.
This study is organized in three main parts. In the next
section we present the results of LDA+U simulations by means
of the ASA LMTO47 code. Then, the same code is employed
to analyze the role of the spin–orbit coupling. In the last section
results from the FP codes are presented, and used as term of
comparison for the ASA results. A brief section summarizing
the main conclusions of our study closes this manuscript.
2. LSDA+U calculations
The investigated SmN has the NaCl-structure, with the
space group Fm3m (no.
225) in which Sm occupies the
(0, 0, 0) position and N is situated in (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The
computational setup in ASA codes like LMTO47 involves a
minimal set of basis functions for each atom in the unit cell.
The radii of the mufﬁn-tin spheres of Sm and N were set to
3.21 a.u. and 2.26 a.u. respectively. As usual for addressing
non-close-packed lattices with ASA codes, empty spheres are
needed.
For SmN two empty spheres were introduced in
the (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) and (3/4, 3/4, 3/4) positions.
The full
Brillouin zone was sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of
(14 14 14) k-points.
Considering the full Brillouin zone
instead of the irreducible wedge is necessary to identify all
possiblelocalminimainLSDA+U,asdiscussedbelow. Finally
the calculations were performed at the experimental lattice
constant, i.e. a = 5.04 Å, and convergence was considered
up to µRy.
The resulting density of states is shown in ﬁgure 1. The
majority spin channel is metallic, while a gap of about 1.04 eV
can be seen in the minority spin channel. The f -states are
formed within the majority spin channel in the vicinity of
the Fermi level, and at the same time a clear Sm(f )-N(p)
hybridization can also be seen. The Sm(f )-N(p) hybridization
is less pronounced in the minority spin channel. This result
is consistent with the electronic structure calculation of Svane
et al [33] that demonstrates the presence of f -bands at the
Fermi level, if the symmetry of the Sm(4f ) density matrix is
not broken artiﬁcially. In this case the three states transforming
according to one of the three dimensional representations of
the Oh group are partially occupied. If the cubic symmetry is
broken, instead, one can access an insulating solution where
one of these states is ﬁlled, while the other two states are
empty [7]. This solution will be discussed in the next section,
due to that it is the solution obtained when SO coupling is
included.
The N(2p) states are seen to dominate the top of the
valence band in the minority spin channel.
Analysing the
band-structure plots (not shown) one notices that the N(2p)
states are separated at the X symmetry point by a gap from
the Sm(5d) states which are the dominant character of the
bottom of the minority spin conduction band. For the majority
electrons, where a metallic character is evidenced, a strong

mixing between Sm(4f ) and Sm(5d) states and N(2p) states
takes place.
We
note
that

measurements of RN compounds are, in general, in good
agreement with the density of states obtained from LSDA+U
calculations, as emphasized in [2]. For SmN, however, our
calculations, and also those of [7] (with and without broken
cubic symmetry), predict a zero gap in the majority spin band.
Furthermore, there is evidence of some spectral weight at the
bottom of the XES spectra, which was associated with the
hybridization between N(2p) states and the highest occupied
Sm(4f ) states in agreement with LSDA+U band structure
calculations.
We should also mention that x-ray circular
dichroism (XMCD) measurements clearly demonstrated that
the N(2p) states are magnetically polarized in GdN, so we
could expect that the polarization of N(2p) is also present in
the SmN compound [34]. This is in fact clearly shown in the
results of ﬁgure 1.
Concerning the magnetic properties, the Sm spin moment
is 5.35 µB, out of which about 0.05 µB belongs to the Sm(5d)
bands, while for N(2p) bands a value of −0.35 µB was
determined. The total magnetic moment per unit cell gives
the integer value of 5.00 µB, according to the half-metallic
band structure. Obviously, these values cannot be compared
with experimental data, since magnetism in RN requires the
inclusion of SO coupling. For the sole purpose of obtaining
orbital moments one can resort to the scheme devised by
Larson et al [7], where one-additional iteration with SO
coupling is run on top of a converged LSDA+U simulation
without SO coupling.
In the present study, however, we
cannot follow the strategy of Larson et al [7], since it has
not sufﬁcient precision to determine the ground state among
several magnetic conﬁgurations. Instead, we will perform full
simulations by means of LSDA+U+SO, as illustrated in the
next section. Before presenting these results it is important
to note that the Hubbard U correction on the localized 4f
states may lead to several solutions, characterised by a different
conﬁguration in the 4f local density matrix. To determine the
ground state it is important to allow for all (or at least as many
as possible) these local minima and identify the global one, as
done by Larson et al [7] and more recently by Peters et al [32].
3. LSDA+U calculations including spin–orbit
coupling
Neutron diffraction experiments on SmN
[13] point to
very small magnetic moments of the order of experimental
errors.
As a result, these experiments are not conclusive
in determining the ground state magnetic structure, and
theoretical calculations become of great importance. In this
study we have analyzed theoretically various types of magnetic
structures in order to obtain information on the ground state.
For the actual computation we considered the rhombohedral
representation of the NaCl structure, which corresponds to a 4
atom unit cell. In this lattice Sm atoms occupy the positions
Sm1(0,0,0) and Sm2 (1,1,1) and nitrogen atoms are situated
at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and (−1/2, −1/2, −1/2) sites.
For the
simulations with SO coupling, we have performed calculations
with and without empty spheres, and ﬁgured out that the
latter do not inﬂuence the qualitative results presented in the
following.
AlsowithintheLSDA+U+SOcalculationsonemayobtain
several local minima.
In the presence of the SO coupling
the symmetry is lowered and the energy landscape of self-
consistent solutions is enriched with respect to the number
of LSDA+U solutions. In the actual calculations, the initial
conditions are translated into the different starting magnetic
structures, i.e. the relative orientation of magnetization axes of
the two Sm atoms in the unit cell. This is in fact possible as
the LMTO47 code allows full non-collinear simulations. With
this approach we have considered several ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic orderings as starting conﬁgurations in which
the magnetic moment of Sm1 atom situated in (0,0,0) was
oriented either parallel or anti-parallel to the second samarium
atom within the unit cell situated at Sm2(1,1,1). Calculations
have been performed with the direction of the moments along
the Cartesian axis.
In addition, other initial conﬁgurations
with the moments direction along the diagonals of the cube
have been also checked. Furthermore initial conﬁgurations
with moments arranged within the (XY), (YZ), (ZX), planes as
well as out of plane conﬁgurations in a non-collinear setup have
been considered. The self-consistent total energy calculations
with SO coupling were performed for a Monkhorst–Pack
grid of (24 24 24) k-points in the full Brillouin zone. The
lowest total energy corresponding to the ground state magnetic
conﬁguration (among those studied) is presented in ﬁgure 2,
and is of type II antiferromagnetic.
The energy difference
between the ground-state and the ferromagnetic phase is of
about 0.002 Ry per formula unit for the selected value of
U = 8.22 eV. The type II antiferromagnetic ground state is
very stable to variations of the strength of the local Coulomb
interaction, and was found to have the lowest energy also for
values of U ranging from 6 to 10 eV.
The computed band structures for the selected values
of U and J are presented in ﬁgure 3.

and anti-parallel arrangements of the samarium magnetic

moments are presented, corresponding to the ferro and anti-
ferromagnetic ordering. Both conﬁgurations exhibit gaps in
the band structure.
For the ferromagnetic conﬁguration the indirect gap is
formed between the  point and k = (−0.33 0.00 0.12)-
point, and has a size of about 0.01 meV. This is in disagreement
with what obtained by Larson et al [7], who found a semi-
metallic behavior characterised by a ﬁnite DOS at the Fermi
level and a small indirect overlap of valence and conduction
bands. In the left panel of ﬁgure 3 one can observe the Sm(5d)
band falling towards the Fermi energy at the F point, but this
energy is never crossed. We will analyze this issue more in
detail in the next section. Concerning the anti-ferromagnetic
conﬁguration, instead, the indirect band gap is formed between
the  point and the k = (0.17 0.29 0.12)-point, and amounts to
0.40 meV.Thesizeoftheindirectgapisparticularlysigniﬁcant,
since it can be compared directly with experiment. Optical
absorption measurements indicate the existence of a gap of
about 0.7 eV [19]. We note that we can also simulate the non-
groundstate anti-ferromagnetic conﬁguration in the LSDA+U
approach, without SO coupling. In this case we still obtain
a semiconductor, but with a narrower gap of about 0.21 eV.
Thus, including SO in a self-consistent way in addition to the
LDA+U approach leads to the correct ground state and the
right tendency of gap increasing.
The magnitude obtained
by calculations is still underestimated in comparison with the
experimental values by a factor of two. An important role in the
gap opening is played by the splitting of the 4f manifold within
LSDA+U+SO approach.
In a cubic crystal ﬁeld the 6H5/2
ground state splits into a 7 doublet and a 8 quartet. Speciﬁc
heat measurements indicate that the doublet is lowest in energy.
The rombohedral representation used in the computations has
a lower symmetry.
This makes it possible to obtain the
splitting described in the previous section without breaking
the symmetry with ad-hoc corrections through the LSDA+U
potential. Results show that the 4f states are splitted. The
empty 4f bands occur about 1 eV above the Fermi energy,
while the occupied 4f states are positioned at around 6 eV
below it, for U = 8.22 eV. This splitting happens for both
parallel and antiparallel alignment, as evident from ﬁgure 3.
From our simulations we can extract the SO coupling
constant λ ≈0.16 eV. This value is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the exchange (Hund) interaction parameter J = 1.07 eV,
which demonstrates that for this compound a relatively weak
SO interaction exists.
This weak interaction results in a
Russell–Saunders (LS coupling) scheme with the spin S and
the orbital L operators being well deﬁned. In such a case
the LS-basis is formed by the eigenfunctions of both spin S
and orbital L moment operators. For our parameters U and
J, in the ferromagnetic conﬁguration, we obtained a Sm(4f )
contribution to the spin moment equal to SSm = 5.00 µB,
while the orbital moment contribution is LSm = −4.57 µB. In
the anti-parallel conﬁguration, instead, we obtained a Sm(4f )
contribution to the spin moment equal to SSm = 4.99 µB,
while the orbital moment contribution is LSm = −4.53 µB.
In both cases the spin and orbital moments are anti-parallel,
i.e. they are arranged with respect to the third Hund’s rule.
The atomic-like behavior of these moments is also clear from
their stability with respect to the magnetic conﬁguration. From
the computed values of |S| and |L| the Land´e factor and the
Sm(4f )magneticmomentwerecalculated, theobtainedvalues
being g = 0.18 and µSmf = 0.36 µB. Finally, the other states
do not contribute much to the magnetic properties of SmN. In
the AFM conﬁguration the spin and orbital moments for the
Sm(5d) states are respectively 0.001 µB and 0.02 µB, while
the magnetic moments at the N sites are zero by symmetry.

RSPt. Results without and with an additional Hubbard correction Ud are shown, respectively in the left panel and right panel.
It is interesting to analyze how these results change by
varying the values of U and J. In fact, limiting our calculations
to values extracted to match a few selected experimental
properties is too much prone to an error, especially in light
of the limitations that experiment have for RNs.
We have
therefore evaluated the magnetic properties for a higher value
of U, i.e. U = 9.22 eV. This corresponds to an increment
of 1 eV with respect to our selected value.
We obtained a
SO coupling constant λ ≈0.17 eV. The magnetic moments
due to the Sm(4f ) states in the anti-parallel conﬁgurations
became SSm = 4.97 µB and LSm = −4.63 µB. These values
exhibit an expected increase of the orbital polarization, which
is compensated by a slight decrease of the spin moment. The
computed Land´e factor and Sm(4f ) magnetic moment were
g = 0.21 and µSmf = 0.55 µB. These values lead to the same
physical picture outlined above.
Thus, we conclude that the magnetic structure of SmN
is essentially of AF-type II. Such magnetic structures were
shown in GdX [35] and TbX [19], with X = P, As, Sb and Bi.
Although the spin and orbital moments of Sm nearly cancel,
ﬁnite values of SmN magnetizations can be obtained. These
can be correlated with the contributions of Sm(5d) and N(2p)
band polarizations resulting mainly from the hybridization
with the Sm(4f ) band.
4. Full potential calculations
Given that the structure of SmN is not strictly close-packed,
we have checked our main results by means of the RSPt
code [22–24], which is based on the FP-LMTO method. The
calculations were limited to the AFM phase of SmN, and were
performed with Sm(6s, 6p, 5d, 4f ) and N(2s, 2p) orbitals for
the valence electrons. The radii of the mufﬁn-tin spheres of
Sm and N were set to 2.5 a.u. and 2.0 a.u. respectively. The
number of kinetic energy tails, describing the basis in the
interstitial region between the mufﬁn-tin spheres, was set to
3 for the s and p states, and to 2 for the d and f states. These
parameters have been carefully checked to offer a converged
basis. The full Brillouin zone was sampled with a Monkhorst–
Pack grid of (24 24 24) k-points.
We have analyzed the magnetic anisotropy in the AFM
phase of type II. We have conﬁrmed that the easy axis is
aligned towards the y-direction, for both DFT in LDA with
SO coupling and LSDA+U+SO. For the simulations where
the magnetization is aligned along the easy axis, the values
of the Sm(4f ) contribution to the spin and orbital moment
are SSm = 4.09 µB and LSm = −3.46 µB. Although to a
ﬁrst sight these values may look rather different than those
presented in the previous section, we have to keep in mind
that in a FP code the mufﬁn-tin spheres cannot overlap, and an
important contribution to the magnetic moments may lay in the
interstitial region. In addition to the magnetic properties, we
have also computed the electronic structure, which is reported
in the left panel of ﬁgure 4.
Here one can see a major
difference with respect to the data reported in ﬁgure 3. In
fact the electronic structure obtained in a FP code presents
semi-metallic character, similarly to what observed by Larson
et al [7] for the FM phase. The presence of states within the
gap changes considerably the physical picture related to the
band structure with respect to the LMTO47 simulations. To
understand if this behavior is due to the ASA character or to
more implementation speciﬁc details, we performed additional
FP simulations with the LAPW code FLEUR [25]. Indeed,
we obtained very similar band structures (not shown) as those
reported in the left panel of ﬁgure 4. The difference between
ASA and FP calculations creates an important problem. On
the one hand the FP simulations must be preferred for accuracy
and reliability, on the other hand the experimental data seem to
support the insulating solution obtained in ASA (see above).
The problem of the absence of an energy gap has been
discussed in detail by Larson et al [7] for the FM phase. There
the authors suggest that an insulating character can be obtained
by means of an additional Hubbard correction for the Sm(5d)
states. They determine a U parameter equal to 6.4 eV in order
to ﬁx the experimental band gap of GdN, while J was set to
zero for sake of simplicity. With these parameters they obtain
a semi-metallic solution for the FM phase of SmN, where the
indirect band gap is of about −0.15 eV. We have followed their
strategy, and performed LSDA+U+SO simulations of the AFM
phase with this setup. The resulting band structure is reported
in the right panel of ﬁgure 4. A band gap is now opened,
5J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27 (2015) 115503
C Morari et al
analogously to what reported in ﬁgure 3. It is interesting to note
how the Hubbard correction to the Sm(5d) states also changes
the position (but not the relative splitting) of the Sm(4f ) levels.
5. Conclusion
In the present paper we have discussed the magnetic and
the electronic properties of the SmN compound.
The
sensitivity of the macroscopic properties to temperature,
pressure and impurities is primarily due to the complex
interplay between the rare-earth 4f –5d interactions and the
hybridization between Sm(4f ) states with the N(2p) states.
The electronic structure results based on the LSDA+U method
favor a half-metallic ground state, whereas if we include the
spin–orbit coupling a magnetic AF-type II structure is obtained
with moments that nearly cancel.
The nearly linear ﬁeld
dependence of the SmN magnetization, at 2 K, experimentally
observed in a thin ﬁlm close to being stoichiometric,
[14]
is not in contradiction with AF ordering.
In addition, the
presence of SO coupling leads to an enlarged semiconducting
gap. However, the magnitude of the gap is still underestimated,
in comparison with the experimental measurements, an
indication that the present LDA+U+SO calculations does
not give a complete description. Full-potential calculations
show, in fact, that the observed gap arises mainly due to the
restrictions imposed by the atomic-sphere approximation and
not because of the Coulomb interaction.
A more physical
description of the band gap can be obtained with an explicit
Hubbard correction for the Sm(5d) states.
However, this
approach presents two important problems. First, it introduces
another parameter in the simulations; second it is indeed
hard to justify the presence of a local Hubbard term to
improve the description of the highly delocalized 5d states.
In this context, ASA simulations have the advantage of
giving a physically correct solution without needing additional
semi-empirical corrections.
It is important to mention that
there is also the possibility that the gap in full potential
calculations can be recovered by some other more exotic
mechanisms that somehow escaped to our analysis, such a very
shallow minimum in the LSDA+U+SO method. In any case,
once the band gap is present, possible metal-semiconductor
transitionsareexpectedupondopingoruponchangingexternal
conditions. In such cases an important role is played by not
only the aforementioned d–d interaction, but also by the f –d
and f –s hybridizations. These effects are ﬁnally entangled
with the multiplet structure of the atomic-like 4f states. In
order to consider the multiplet structure properly, an approach
beyond the static mean-ﬁeld is needed.
The LDA+DMFT
approach [36–38] in the Hubbard I approximation [38, 39] is
capable of capturing all these effects, and has already been
applied to the paramagnetic ErAs [40], and to TbN [32]. This
type of calculations introduce additional difﬁculties that we
plan to address in our future research.
