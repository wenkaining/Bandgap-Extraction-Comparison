Shear to longitudinal mode conversion via second harmonic generation is studied theoret-
ically and computationally for plane waves in a two-dimensional, adhesive, hexagonally
close-packed microscale granular medium. The model includes translational and rotational
degrees of freedom, as well as normal and shear contact interactions. We consider funda-
mental frequency plane waves in all three linear modes, which have infinite spatial extent
and travel in one of the high-symmetry crystal directions. The generated second harmonic
waves are longitudinal for all cases. For the lower transverse–rotational mode, an analyti-
cal expression for the second harmonic amplitude, which is derived using a successive ap-
proximations approach, reveals the presence of particular resonant and antiresonant wave
numbers, the latter of which is prohibited if rotations are not included in the model. By
simulating a lattice with adhesive contact force laws, we study the effectiveness of the the-
oretical analysis for non-resonant, resonant, and antiresonant cases. This work is suitable
for the analysis of microscale and statically compressed macroscale granular media, and
should inspire future studies on nonlinear two- and three-dimensional granular systems
in which interparticle shear coupling and particle rotations play a significant role.

1. Introduction
Granular media are known to exhibit complex dynamical behavior that stems from their discrete, often heterogeneous,
structure and highly nonlinear particulate interactions [1–3]. Ordered and reduced-dimensional granular systems, often
referred to as ‘‘granular crystals,’’ have been a setting of interest for several decades, as they have yielded new,
broader understanding of granular media dynamics [3]. In addition, utilization of the nonlinear particulate interactions in
conjunction with classical linear effects such as dispersion induced by structural periodicity has resulted in granular crystals
being used in new strategies for passive wave tailoring [4,5].

Models used to describe granular crystals are typically composed of one- to three-dimensional (1D and 3D, respectively)
systems of rigid bodies interacting via Hertzian normal contact ‘‘springs’’ [6,7]. For example, this approach has been used
in previous studies to explore highly nonlinear mechanical wave propagation in uncompressed two-dimensional (2D)
granular crystals [3,8–12]. While this type of model works well for uncompressed granular media, interparticle shear
interactions and particle rotations become increasingly important in statically compressed granular systems. Several recent
theoretical works, based on earlier discrete lattice models of elastic media [13], have introduced linear models of 2- [14,15]
and 3D [16] granular crystals that account for interparticle shear interactions and particle rotations. These studies
demonstrated how the additional degrees of freedom and modes of particle coupling can drastically influence the granular
crystal dynamics, and yield unique effects such as the rotational waves experimentally observed in statically compressed
macroscale granular systems [17]. Shear interactions and particle rotations also play a similarly important role in the
emerging field of microscale granular crystals, as has been demonstrated in recent theoretical [18] and experimental [19]
studies of quasi-1D microgranular systems in linear dynamical regimes.
In this work, we explore the nonlinear phenomenon of second harmonic generation for plane waves traveling in a model
of a 2D hexagonally close-packed lattice of microspheres, which includes interparticle adhesive effects, particle rotations,
and elastic shear interactions. Second harmonic generation is a well-known phenomenon that has been studied extensively
in nonlinear optics [20] and acoustics [21]. Past works have also examined second harmonic generation in 1D discrete
granular chains [22,23] and fluid-saturated granular media [24]. Using a successive approximations approach in the manner
of Refs. [22,23], we theoretically analyze the second harmonic generation for cases where the fundamental frequency (FF)
wave is purely longitudinal or transverse–rotational in character, and find that the generated second harmonic waves
are longitudinal in both scenarios. Such shear-to-longitudinal mode conversion via second harmonic generation has been
previously studied in nonlinear elastic solids [25], observed experimentally in 3D granular packings [26,27], and modeled
in quasi-1D nonlinear phononic crystals [28]. We show that the second harmonic generated by a FF wave in the lower
transverse–rotational mode may resonate or vanish for particular wavelengths, but the latter phenomenon is not predicted
if rotations are excluded from the model. Finally, we compare our theoretical predictions with dynamic discrete element
simulations of a microscale granular crystal. We find that the theoretical predictions are quantitatively accurate for non-
resonant wavelengths, and provide qualitative understanding of the behavior at resonance. This paper extends the already
rich body of work on nonlinear waves in 2- and 3D ordered granular media by exploring the interplay of multiple degrees
of freedom and nonlinear particulate interactions.
2. Theory
2.1. Model
We consider a 2D, hexagonally close-packed lattice of spheres, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The interactions between spheres
follow the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) adhesion model [29,30], which includes Hertzian normal contact forces [6,7],
and a static adhesive force FDMT = 2πwRc due to van der Waals interactions, where w is the work of adhesion [30], Rc = R/2
is the effective radius for two spheres in contact, and R is the microsphere radius. To describe the shear contact interactions,
we use the Hertz–Mindlin model [7,31], assuming no slip occurs in the contact surface. Because the characteristic sound
speeds of waves in the lattice are much slower than those of the bulk material of the spheres, we treat the spheres as rigid
bodies with radius R, mass m, and moment of inertia I = (2/5)mR2, interacting via nonlinear spring elements [3]. In terms
of the displacements uj,k, vj,k, and θj,k, which represent horizontal, vertical, and angular displacements from equilibrium,
respectively, the equations of motion of the sphere with index (j, k) are given by

We restrict our analysis to plane waves traveling in the positive y direction; hence, the equations of motion take the form
of an effective 1D lattice with three degrees of freedom, and we adopt the single index n, where n = k. We also transform the
system to dimensionless variables p = v/D0, q = −u/D0, φ = Rθ/D0, where D0 is a characteristic displacement amplitude,
and τ = tωL, where ωL = 2√(g1 + 3k1)/(2m) is the cutoff frequency for longitudinal waves in the linearized system.
Finally, the equations of motion are reduced to a simpler form, which is valid for small nonlinearity (|ϵ| ≪1):

note that the rescaled variables pn and qn represent displacements parallel and transverse to the direction of propagation,

2.2. Quasi-linear regime
In the limit of vanishing amplitude, the dynamics are linear, and the medium behaves as the 2D hexagonal lattice studied
in [13] (neglecting rotational springs). Using Eqs. (8)–(10) with ϵ = 0, we derive the dispersion relation, and find three
modes, as shown in Fig. 2(a): one that involves only longitudinal motion, and two involving coupled transverse and rotationalS.P. Wallen, N. Boechler / Wave Motion 68 (2017) 22–30

Following conventions used in previous works [16,17], we denote the longitudinal mode ‘‘L’’, and the lower and
upper transverse–rotational modes as ‘‘TR’’ and ‘‘RT’’, respectively, where the first letter corresponds to the predominant
displacement of each mode. While models for 3D hexagonally close-packed granular crystals [16], which include shear
interactions and particle rotations, predict faster wave speeds, due to additional interparticle coupling terms, and additional
plane wave modes due to periodically alternating layers (including purely rotational modes), we suggest that our model may
also be utilized to gain qualitative understanding of certain 3D scenarios. This is due to the similarity of acoustic-type L and
TR modes, as well as one of the optical-type RT modes, present in both 2D and 3D systems.
2.3. Weakly-nonlinear regime: second harmonic generation and nonlinear mode conversion
For |ϵ| ≪1, the nonlinear response can be predicted using a successive-approximations approach, in the manner of
Refs. [22,23]. Using this approach, we represent the displacements as power series in ϵ:
pn(τ) = P0,n(τ) + ϵP1,n(τ) + ϵ2P2,n(τ) + · · ·
(14)
qn(τ) = Q0,n(τ) + ϵQ1,n(τ) + ϵ2Q2,n(τ) + · · ·
(15)
φn(τ) = Φ0,n(τ) + ϵΦ1,n(τ) + ϵ2Φ2,n(τ) + · · · ,
(16)
and explore second harmonic generation in the granular medium, separately considering the cases of TR/RT and L modes
as FF waves. While previous works employing this approach have focused on finite-length and semi-infinite lattices
[22,23] with a harmonic boundary condition, we consider an infinite lattice, and use a single plane wave of infinite extent
that travels in the positive-n direction as the initial condition; that is,
pn(0) = P0,n(0) = ˜P0ei(ξn),
(17)

n(0) = P′
0,n(0) = −iΩ˜P0ei(ξn),
(18)26
S.P. Wallen, N. Boechler / Wave Motion 68 (2017) 22–30
where ˜P0 is a constant amplitude, with similar expressions for the other displacements. Thus, the second harmonic response
is a function of wave number. This configuration closely resembles the conditions of several recent experiments on
microscale granular crystals [34] that utilize the laser-induced transient grating spectroscopy technique [35], which excite
waves with specific, defined wavelengths via the projection of a spatially periodic optical interference pattern.
We note that, for the expansions given by Eqs. (14)–(16) to be valid, each function P0, P1, etc. should be of order O(1);
this imposes limits on the range of wave numbers for which the analysis is valid, as will be discussed later.
2.3.1. TR and RT modes as fundamental waves
We first consider TR and RT modes as FF waves, i.e.
pn(0) = p′
n(0) = 0
(19)
qn(0) = Q0,n(0) = ˜Q0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0, q′
n(0) = −iΩqn(0)
(20)
φn(0) = Φ0,n(0) = ˜Φ0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0, φ′
n(0) = −iΩφn(0).
(21)
We proceed by substituting the power series given by Eqs. (14)–(16) into Eqs. (8)–(10). At order O(ϵ0), we find that P0,n,
Q0,n, and Φ0,n must be plane waves satisfying the linear dispersion relations given by Eqs. (11) and (12). To satisfy the initial
condition given by Eq. (19), it follows that P0,n(τ) = 0. Furthermore, the ratio of amplitudes of the Q0,n and Φ0,n plane waves
is constrained; in particular, a vector composed of these two amplitudes must be an eigenvector of the dispersion matrix
M corresponding to the eigenvalues ξ and Ω. Because we have chosen a plane wave in the TR or RT mode as the initial
condition, this constraint is trivially satisfied.

(24)
Since P0,n = 0, the right-hand side of Eq. (22) is composed of quadratic products of Q0,n and Φ0,n, while the right-hand sides
of Eqs. (23) and (24) vanish. Thus, the second harmonics at order O(ϵ1) generated by fundamental plane waves in the TR
and RT modes are purely longitudinal in character. Furthermore, from the initial conditions given by Eqs. (20) and (21), it
follows that Q1,n(τ) = Φ1,n(τ) = 0.
We derive an expression for P1,n(τ) by seeking a solution of the form
P1,n(τ) = ˜P(+)
1,n ei(2ξn−Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P(−)
1,n ei(2ξn+Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P(TR)
1,n ei(2ξn−2Ωτ),
(25)
where Ω(2ξ) is found using Eq. (11). The first two terms of the ansatz given by Eq. (25) are the homogeneous part of
the solution, with the (+) and (−) superscripts corresponding to positive- and negative-n traveling waves, respectively.
The third term is generated by the FF wave terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (22), and the superscript (TR) signifies
that the generating FF wave is in either transverse–rotational mode. To derive an expression for the amplitude of the
generated second harmonic wave, we substitute into Eq. (22) the expressions P1,n = ˜P(TR)
1,n ei(2ξn−2Ωτ), Q0,n = ˜Q0ei(ξn−Ωτ)
and Φ0,n = ˜Φ0ei(ξn−Ωτ), and adopt the convention that the FF amplitudes ˜Q0 and ˜Φ0 have been normalized, such that
the sum of their squares is unity. After simplification, we find an expression for the amplitude of the longitudinal second
harmonic wave that depends on the amplitudes of the FF waves (either TR or RT), as well as the wave number:

(26)
where the ratio ˜Q0/ ˜Φ0 is a function of ξ. This expression is applicable for FF waves in both the TR and RT modes, and is
plotted for each case in Fig. 2(b)–(c).
In Fig. 2(c), we observe a resonance near ξ ≃π/2; this arises because the generated second harmonic wave of the TR
mode (i.e. the third term of Eq. (25)) has a wave number and frequency that intersect the L mode, as shown in Fig. 2(a). SuchS.P. Wallen, N. Boechler / Wave Motion 68 (2017) 22–30
27
resonances indicate perfect phase matching [20,21] between the generated and homogeneous second harmonic waves, and
the conversion of energy from the TR mode to L the mode is most efficient at this wave number. Since the value of ˜P(TR)
1,n near
the resonance is larger than O(1), the expansion given by Eq. (14) is no longer valid, as the generated harmonics would grow
to the same order of magnitude as the FF wave. The wave number at which this resonance occurs depends on the mass and
stiffness properties of the lattice, but the resonance must exist in our model, because the generated second harmonic wave
will always possess an intersection with the L mode, though it may occur outside the first Brillouin zone. In the limiting case
of infinitely large rotational inertia or vanishing shear contact stiffness (i.e. neglecting rotations or shear interactions), the
resonance still exists, albeit at a different wave number.
We also note the presence of an antiresonance in Fig. 2(c); this implies that the quadratic nonlinearities vanish at order
O(ϵ1), for a particular wavelength. Near the antiresonance, the harmonics generated by higher-order nonlinearities can be
of the same order of magnitude as the second harmonic waves; thus, these nonlinearities would need to be included in
Eqs. (8)–(10), and additional terms of the expansions given by Eqs. (14)–(16) should be included, to obtain accurate results.
The wave number of this antiresonance is dependent on mass and stiffness properties, but is not guaranteed to exist for
arbitrary parameter values; indeed, the numerator of Eq. (26) is not guaranteed to vanish, except for values of ξ that are
integer multiples of π (corresponding to the edges of the Brillouin zones). We note that the antiresonance cannot exist in
the limit of infinitely large rotational inertia, i.e. ˜Φ0 = 0, which highlights the importance of particle rotations in our model.
Considering finite rotational inertia, we derive a condition on the wave number ξ and frequency ω that must be satisfied
at the antiresonance. The dispersion relation given by Eq. (12) is a solvability condition of the matrix equation

Thus, by manipulating either of the two scalar equations in this system, the ratio ˜Φ0/ ˜Q0 can be written in terms of ξ, Ω, and

(29)
which defines a condition for the antiresonance. Thus, if the TR dispersion branch intersects the curve defined by Eq. (29),
the antiresonance exists at the corresponding wave number and frequency, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Furthermore, when the
Hertz–Mindlin contact model is assumed, the stiffness parameters contained in Eq. (29) are all related by Poisson’s ratio
ν [7]. By manipulating Eqs. (12) and (29), it can be shown that the TR mode has a higher cutoff frequency at ξ = π than
the curve defined by Eq. (29), but has a lesser slope at the origin. It follows that the intersection is guaranteed to exist for
physically realizable materials (i.e. −1 ≤ν ≤0.5).
From these resonance and antiresonance conditions, it follows that when the FF wave is in the RT mode, neither is
permitted; this is because the frequency of the generated second harmonic wave is always above the cutoff frequency of
the L mode. The effect of the cutoff frequency can also be seen by comparing the generated second harmonic amplitudes
of the TR and RT modes. As shown in Fig. 2(b), (c), for wave numbers below the resonance, the generated second harmonic
amplitude ˜P(TR)
1,n of FF waves in the RT mode is generally lower than that of the TR mode, while for wave numbers above
the resonance, the amplitudes are generally of similar order (excepting the effects of the antiresonance). This is due to the
relative proximities of the generated second harmonic waves to the propagation band of the L mode: as shown in Fig. 2(a),
at low wave numbers, the generated second harmonic waves from the RT mode are far above the cutoff frequency of the L
mode, while those of the TR mode are in the propagation band. Above the resonance, both the TR and RT modes generate
second harmonic waves above the cutoff, but have similar proximity to the pass band.
Enforcing the initial condition given by Eq. (19), which implies that there is no second harmonic at time τ
= 0
(i.e. P1,n(0) = P′
1,n(0) = 0), we derive the amplitudes of the homogeneous terms as a function of the generated second
harmonic amplitude:

We note that, for an experimental setup, the FF wave would contain components traveling in both the positive and
negative directions. In a region where these two components interact, two additional longitudinal second harmonic waves
would be present: a negative-n traveling wave analogous to the third term of Eq. (25), which also has the same dependence
on ξ, and a standing wave with wave number 2ξ and vanishing frequency, which arises due to the interaction between FF

2.3.2. L mode as fundamental wave
We now conduct a similar analysis using a plane wave in the L mode as the FF wave, i.e.
pn(0) = P0,n(0) = ˜P0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0,
p′
n(0) = −iΩpn(0)
(32)
qn(0) = φn(0) = 0,
q′
n(0) = φ′
n(0) = 0.
(33)
By inspecting the quadratic terms in Eqs. (9)–(10), we observe that no motion in the transverse and rotational displacements
can be generated via nonlinearity, because these terms are all products containing qn and φn. Thus, the remaining equation
of motion given by Eq. (8) reduces to a form that is mathematically equivalent to that in [23], while the boundary conditions
differ.
After substituting the power series of Eq. (14) into Eq. (8), we equate the coefficients of order O(ϵ0), seek solutions of the
form P0,n(τ) = ˜P0ei(ξn−Ωτ), and find that P0,n(τ) satisfies Eq. (11), the dispersion relation of the L mode. At order O(ϵ1), we
find

4(P1,n+1 −2P1,n + P1,n−1) =
1
8(P0,n+1 −2P0,n + P0,n−1)(P0,n+1 −P0,n−1).
(34)
This is a linear equation for P1,n with a generation term that is quadratic in P0,n. Thus, we seek a solution as the sum of
homogeneous and generated second harmonic waves in the form
P1,n(τ) = ˜P(+)
1,n ei(2ξn−Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P(−)
1,n ei(2ξn+Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P(L)
1,nei(2ξn−2Ωτ),
(35)
where each term is analogous to the corresponding term in Eq. (25). Here, the superscript (L) signifies that the generating
FF wave belongs to the L mode. The amplitude of the generated term ˜P(L)
1,n, which is analogous to Eq. (26), can be derived as
in [23], where a detailed analysis has been performed. While the system considered in [23] is 1D and clearly not identical
to our own, the calculation of ˜P(L)
1,n is mathematically equivalent.
Because this solution must satisfy the initial conditions given by Eqs. (17) and (18), the amplitudes of the homogeneous
terms may be derived in the same way as for FF waves in the TR and RT modes, and appear in the same form as Eqs. (30)
and (31), with the exception that the superscript (TR) must be replaced by (L).
3. Simulations
3.1. Numerical setup
To examine the validity of our theoretical analysis with a complete Hertzian nonlinearity, we simulate second harmonic
generation from an FF wave in the TR mode by numerically solving Eqs. (1)–(3) for 1 < n < 201. We use initial conditions
of the form given in Eqs. (20)–(21), with fixed boundaries. For each case, we probe the response of the central lattice site
(n = 101), and end the simulation before disturbances caused by the boundaries reach this site. We present the results in
terms of the normalized variables p101(τ), q101(τ), and φ101(τ).
3.2. Numerical results
As shown in Fig. 3, we simulate the lattice using three wave numbers, each representing a qualitatively different case:
(1) ξ1 = 0.802, which is far from the resonance and antiresonance; (2) ξ2 = 1.475, which is approximately the resonant
wave number; and (3)ξ3 = 2.127, which is approximately the antiresonant wave number. We have chosen the characteristic
amplitude D0 = 0.2∆0, which results in the nonlinearity parameter ϵsim ≈−0.1.
For case (1), the perturbation analysis is valid (note from Fig. 2(c) that ˜P(TR)
1,n ≃O(1)), and the simulated time histories
are well-approximated by the theoretical predictions, as shown in Fig. 3(a), (d). In Fig. 3(d), it can be seen that the second
harmonic amplitude exhibits ‘‘beating’’ at a frequency Ωbeat = Ω(2ξ)−2Ω; this phenomenon is a well-known characteristic
of second harmonic generation [20,23]. For case (2), the oscillations of p101 grow linearly in τ, as shown in Fig. 3(e). While
the theoretical prediction for p101 appears to match the simulation reasonably well, it is evident from Fig. 3(b) that there is
significant error in q101 andφ101; in fact, the second harmonic is visibly present in the simulated signals. This is because, while
the approximation works well for small τ, the generated second harmonic longitudinal wave eventually reaches the same
order of magnitude as the FF wave, thereby violating the assumption of weak nonlinearity. While even-order harmonics are
not common for transverse waves in elastic media [25], they are supported in our model, because the normal springs (and
therefore the even-order nonlinearity necessary for second harmonic generation) are activated by transverse motion in a
hexagonally close-packed granular crystal. For case (3), the predictions for q101 and φ101 are accurate, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
However, as shown in Fig. 3(f), there is large error in p101, the generated longitudinal wave. This is because the harmonics
generated by higher-order nonlinearities are larger than those coming from order O(ϵ1); such harmonics are clearly visible
in the simulated signal.S.P. Wallen, N. Boechler / Wave Motion 68 (2017) 22–30

4. Conclusion
In this work, we have analyzed shear to longitudinal mode conversion via second harmonic generation for plane waves in
a 2D, adhesive, hexagonally close-packed microscale granular crystal, accounting for translational and rotational degrees of
freedom, as well as normal and shear contact interactions. In the case of a FF wave in the L mode, we show that the generated
second harmonic is also longitudinal, and can be described using the same equations as for a 1D chain studied in earlier
works. For the case where the lowest TR mode is treated as the FF wave, the generated second harmonic wave is longitudinal,
and an analytical expression for the second harmonic amplitude reveals the presence of resonant and antiresonant wave
numbers. This antiresonance is not predicted if rotations are excluded from the model, which demonstrates that, while the
TR mode is predominantly transverse for most wavelengths, particle rotations produce a qualitative change in the nonlinear
lattice dynamics. By simulating a lattice with DMT and Hertz–Mindlin particle interactions, we verify the accuracy of the
theoretical analysis for a non-resonant case, and find that it effectively predicts the qualitative behavior of the resonant
and antiresonant cases. Future generalizations of this work to off-symmetry directions of propagation and extension to
strongly nonlinear dynamical regimes may yield particularly interesting phenomena. This work is particularly suitable for
the analysis of both microscale granular crystals, which are naturally precompressed by adhesive forces, and statically
compressed granular crystals with macroscale particles. We expect that future studies of such 2- and 3D granular media
will yield unique dynamics stemming from the interplay of interparticle shear coupling and particle rotations with highly
nonlinear phenomena such as solitary waves [3] or hysteretic contact mechanics [36].
