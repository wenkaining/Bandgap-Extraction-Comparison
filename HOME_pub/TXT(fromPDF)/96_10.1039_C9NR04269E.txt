Atomic localization of quantum emitters in multilayer
hexagonal boron nitride†
Tobias Vogl,∗a‡ Marcus W. Doherty,b Ben C. Buchler,a Yuerui Lu,c and Ping Koy Lam∗a
The recent discovery of single-photon emitting defects hosted by the two-dimensional wide band
gap semiconductor hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has inspired a great number of experiments.
Key characteristics of these quantum emitters are their capability to operate at room temperature
with a high luminosity. In spite of large theoretical and experimental research efforts, the exact na-
ture of the emission remains unresolved. In this work we utilize layer-by-layer etching of multilayer
hBN to localize the quantum emitters with atomic precision. Our results suggest the position of
the emitters correlates with the fabrication method: emitters formed under plasma treatment are
always in close proximity to the crystal surface, while emitters created under electron irradiation
are distributed randomly throughout the entire crystal. This disparity could be traced back to the
lower kinetic energy of the ions in the plasma compared to the kinetic energy of the electrons in
the particle accelerator. The emitter distance to the surface also correlates with the excited state
lifetime: near-surface emitters have a shorter compared to emitters deep within the crystal. Finite-
difference time-domain and density functional theory simulations show that optical and electronic
effects are not responsible for this difference, indicating effects such as coupling to surface defects
or phonons might cause the reduced lifetime. Our results pave a way toward identiﬁcation of the
defect, as well as engineering the emitter properties.
Introduction
The recent discovery of quantum emitters in two-dimensional
(2D) materials attracted considerable attention, due to their ap-
plications in photonic quantum technologies1. These include un-
conditionally secure communication2, quantum simulators3 and
quantum computing4, which fueled the development of single-
photon sources (SPSs). In contrast to their counterparts in 3D,
quantum emitters hosted by 2D lattices are not surrounded by
any high refractive index medium. This eliminates total internal
and Fresnel reﬂection of emitted single-photons, making it possi-
ble to have intrinsically near-ideal extraction efﬁciency. Quan-
tum emission has been reported from a diversity of materials,

in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)5–12
and insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)13. The large band
gap of the latter even allows one to resolve the zero phonon line
(ZPL) at room temperature and thwarts non-radiative recombi-
nation of the localized exciton. Thus, single-photon emitters in
hBN have an intrinsically high quantum efﬁciency which leads
to signiﬁcantly brighter emission13,14. In addition, single-photon
sources based on hBN are suitable for many practical ﬁeld appli-
cations due to their resistance to ionizing radiation15, tempera-
ture stability over a huge range spanning 800K16,17, long-term
operation18 and capabilities for integration with photonic net-
works19,20, as well as easy handling. While these emitters can
occur naturally13, it is common to enhance the defect formation
synthetically through chemical21 or plasma etching18,22, γ-ray15,
ion23 and electron irradiation23,24 or near-deterministic stress-
induced activation25.
The generally accepted model for the single-photon emission is
based on a localized exciton. These ﬂuorescent point-like defects
introduce trap states into the electronic band gap, acting thus as
an effective two-level system. In deﬁance of several attempts to
identify the origin of the ﬂuorescence using group theory and ab
initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations26–28, the ex-
act nature of the defects remains controversial. Possible defect
candidates include the CBVN, VBCN, VNNB and VB defects (CBVN:

vacancy; VBCN: a carbon atom substitutes for a nitrogen atom
with an adjacent boron vacancy; VNNB: a nitrogen occupying the
lattice site of a boron atom with an adjacent nitrogen vacancy;
VB: single boron vacancy). It was recently noted, however, that
widely used generalized gradient functionals can perform poorly
and lead to misassignment of the defect states, hence, hybrid or
long-range corrected functionals should be applied29. Moreover,
DFT calculations often assume monolayered supercells due to the
exponential scaling with the number of atoms and limited compu-
tational resources, while most experimental works involve multi-
layer hBN. For yet not fully understood reasons, the optical emis-
sion signatures of quantum emitters hosted by mono- and multi-
layer hBN differ substantially13.
On the experimental side, research efforts toward the identiﬁ-
cation30,31 are hampered by the strongly varying optical emission
properties. These vary not only from defect to defect on differ-
ent hBN crystals, but also for defects on the same host crystal.
ZPLs have been reported in the UV32 and in the the visible spec-
trum from 550 to 800nm16,18,33,34 and the excited state lifetimes
vary from 20ns down to 0.3ns18,19. A conclusive explanation for
this requires additional experimental analysis. What is deﬁnitely
known is the power saturation behavior is that of an idealized
two- or multi-level system and the emitters exhibit an in-plane
dipole. This indicates a low symmetry in-plane defect that is po-
tentially comprised of vacancies and impurities.
The variations in ZPL position cannot be explained alone by lo-
cal strain in the crystal environment. The shifts caused by strain
are too small to account for the variety of ZPLs35. Of particular
note is that the ZPLs seem to bunch in groups around 560nm18,
580nm36, 640nm13,33 and 714nm33. We deﬁne these as groups
1 through 4, respectively. It is believed that a different point-like
defect is responsible for each group with the crystal lattice locally
strained or changed otherwise, thus explaining the spread around
these wavelengths. Shifts of the transition line caused by differ-
ent isotopes would be much smaller than the emission linewidth.
The vibronic bandshape of most defects is very similar, indicating
that they have the same symmetry group. We note that there are
occasional ZPLs falling into neither of these categories. It is likely
that these originate from surface contaminants. Moreover, the
bandshape of these differ from the bandshape typical for other
emitters in the four groups, which supports this conjecture.
Using super-resolution techniques, these defects have been lo-
calized in 2D with sub-diffraction resolution37. The direct imag-
ing on the atomic scale using high-resolution scanning transmis-
sion electron microscopy (STEM) is limited to a few layers, as
the images contain information from all layers (essentially being
a projection of all layers onto 2D). One way around this is to
use a more advanced method like high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld
imaging (HAADF), with which it is possible to detect the pres-
ence of a vacancy within a few layers (maybe up to 3-5 layers).
A vacancy would change the detected intensity by changing the
scattering probability locally, and thus this would reveal such a
defect with the exact location in the XY plane.
However, this
still does not contain any information about the Z direction. Re-
cently, a method to correlate optical and electron characteriza-
tions of quantum emitters in very thin hBN was demonstrated31.
This method, however, also yields no information about the Z di-
rection. In addition, detecting the presence of a vacancy using
HAADF cannot be used on thicker crystals, because the intensity
contrast would be too low.
In this work, we localize the quantum emitters hosted by mul-
tilayer hBN in the third dimension with atomic precision.
We
develop deterministic layer-by-layer plasma etching of hBN. This
way we can remove a single hBN monolayer at a time and check
ex-situ when the defect disappears. We thereby measure the pre-
cise distance of the emitter from the surface of the host crystal.
While this is a destructive technique, it allows us to extract the ex-
act number of layers in which the defect was located. Repeating
our experiment for many defects allows us to generate sufﬁcient
statistics. We also model photophysical properties theoretically
with ﬁnite-difference time-domain simulations and density func-
tional theory.
Results and Discussion
Layer-by-layer etching of hBN
Our approach to extract the location of the defects in the Z di-
rection is to selectively remove one hBN monolayer at a time and
check after each step, if the defect is still present. We ﬁrst devel-
oped the layer-by-layer etching of hBN using an oxygen plasma.
We note that similar etching of hBN on the atomic scale was re-
ported recently using an argon plasma38. While this is an impor-
tant milestone, however, Park et al. etched ∼20 layers at a time
and scaled this down to monolayer etching38. Nevertheless, with
this technique as well as our method (see below), it is possible to
fabricate large hBN monolayers. These are very difﬁcult to obtain
using mechanical exfoliation alone, due to the poor optical con-
trast of hBN, which has a zero-crossing in the visible spectrum39.
We mechanically exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride from bulk
crystal onto a viscoelastic polymer. Thin, but still several nm thick
hBN ﬂakes were selected by optical contrast for dry transfer to
a Si substrate terminated with a layer of thermally grown SiO2
(262nm). For the etching we used an oxygen plasma generated
from a microwave ﬁeld and empirically optimized the plasma pa-
rameters (see Methods). The crystal thickness after each succes-
sive etching step is measured with a phase-shift interferometer
(PSI), which is a much faster method than using an atomic force
microscope (AFM) at the cost of a lower lateral resolution. Figure
1(a) shows the PSI image prior to any plasma treatment and after
2 min of etching time, where the crystal thickness decreased. The
top ﬂake consists of 9 and 7 atomic layers, respectively. The op-
tical path length (OPL) difference between the substrate and the
crystal (measured along the white dashed lines in Figure 1(a))
at a PSI wavelength of λ = 532nm after each cumulative etching
step is shown in Figure 1(b). It can be seen that the etched thick-
ness is linear with time. The OPL can be converted to physical
thickness using rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) simula-
tions40, as shown in Figure 1(c). The simulations assume the re-
fractive index of hBN to be 1.849, which was extracted by ﬁtting
an RCWA model to data pairs consisting of AFM and PSI measure-
ments. It is worth noting that the relation between OPL and phys-

DOI: 10.1039/C9NR04269Eical thickness d is nonlinear for large OPLs18. The data points in
Figure 1(c) correspond to the PSI measurements (colored accord-
ingly). Since the physical thickness of hBN is 0.4 −0.45nm per
layer41, we can extract that the crystal presented here was etched
layer-by-layer from 9 layers to monolayer, with an etching rate of
1 layer per 63s. A microscope image with an artiﬁcially-enhanced
optical contrast of the bilayer is shown in Figure 1(d). At the op-
timized plasma conditions, this atomic layer-by-layer etching is
highly reliable, with no fails (i.e. 0 or 2 layers etched) out of 31
runs. Moreover, we used the same technique on TMDs without
failures and the method was also used for precise layer-by-layer
thinning of black phosphorus42 or MoS2 43. Assuming the failure
probability to be ≤0.1% would reproduce our etching success of
hBN with a high probability of 96.9%. Deviating from the ideal
plasma conditions (63s etching time, for all details see Methods)
results in process failures. This is evident by the fact that reducing
the etching time by 10s resulted into 2 out of 6 crystals not being
etched and increasing the etching time by 10s resulted in two lay-
ers being etched in 1 out of 3 cases (see Supporting Information,
Figure S1). The reason why multiple layers can be etched without
doubling the etching time is because it takes some time to start
cracking the bonds, once that process starts, a faster etching rate
can be achieved.
It is important to note that the plasma may damage the sub-
strate. The OPL is dependent on the SiO2 thickness and the RCWA
simulations assume this to be ﬁxed. We checked the thickness of
a SiO2 layer ex-situ after each etching step using variable angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). After 7min at 100W of cumu-
lative plasma treatment, the thickness of a SiO2 layer decreased
from 262.68(1) to 262.46(1)nm (see Figure 1(e)), so on aver-
age the SiO2 thinning is 0.03nm per step. According to the RCWA
simulations such substrate thickness difference results in a change
of the OPL much smaller than the resolution of the PSI (0.1nm).
Therefore, we can neglect this effect. This is, however, in gen-
eral dependent on the type of plasma. For a comparison: using
a CF4 plasma at 100W for 1min results in a thickness change of
0.22nm of the SiO2 and using a CF4 plasma at 500W for 3min in
the plasma ﬁeld maximum (see Methods) etches 12.49nm.
Creation of quantum emitters
The fabrication of multilayer hBN ﬂakes for hosting single-photon
emitter is similar to the procedure above. After transfer to the
substrate, the ﬂakes are treated with an oxygen plasma at dif-
ferent conditions and successively annealed in a rapid thermal
annealer18 (see also Methods). To locate the defects each ﬂake
is scanned in a custom-built confocal micro-photoluminescence
(µPL) system with a resolution ranging from 0.2 to 1µm. Initially,
the ﬂakes are scanned with a 1µm grid and identiﬁed defects are
located with a smaller step size of 0.2µm, preventing accidentally
missing any known defect location during subsequent scans. The
pump laser, with its wavelength at 522nm, is blocked by a long-
pass ﬁlter and the emission is collected in-reﬂection. The defects
almost exclusively occur at the edges of the host crystal ﬂakes,
due to a lower defect formation energy at these locations. Defects
can, however, also form along crystal cracks within the ﬂake. The
defect formation energy there is lower as well. The spectra of
three sample emitters are shown in Figure 2(a), which have their
ZPLs at 559.78(7), 565.15(6) and 650.16(7)nm and Lorentzian
linewidths of 2.24(10), 2.51(9) and 4.39(9)nm, respectively. All
sample emitters presented here emit more than 80% of their pho-
toluminescence (PL) into the ZPL, which allows for a high quan-
tum efﬁciency. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals a single-
exponential decay of the excited state population for each defect
with lifetimes 770(7), 549(7) and 794(13)ps, respectively (see
Figure 2(b)). The excitation laser is pulsed at a repetition rate of
20.8MHz and a pulse length of 300fs. While this allows for high
peak intensities, two-photon absorption of the band gap of hBN is
still impossible, because EhBN = 6eV > 2×2.38eV = 2×Elaser. To
prove that the localized exciton emits indeed non-classical light
we utilize a Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT)-type interferome-
ter, which allows for measuring the second order correlation func-
tion (see Figure 2(c)). We ﬁt a three-level model with excited and
meta-stable shelving state to our data. The correlation function is
then given by
g(2) (τ) = 1−Ae−|τ|/t1 +Be−|τ|/t2
with the anti- and bunching-amplitudes A, B, and the charac-
teristic lifetimes t1, t2.
For the three sample emitters we ﬁnd
g(2) (0) = 0.142(37),0.196(53) and 0.234(44), respectively. There
was no background correction44 necessary due to the low detec-
tor noise compared to the single-photon brightness.
This also
means that the observed ﬁnite multi-photon probability is not
caused by detector dark counts, but rather noise sources excited
by the laser.
Note that the experimental data was normalized
such that for inﬁnite time delay g(2)(τ →∞) = 1. The lifetimes ex-
tracted from the correlation function measurements agree well
with the lifetimes measured with time-resolved PL. As already
mentioned, the literature reports ZPLs typically bunch around
certain wavelengths. In fact, in our experiments we have seen this
to happen around 560nm, 590nm and 640nm, as the histogram
in Figure 2(d) shows. With our fabrication method, however, we
were not able to create emitters with ZPLs > 700nm with sta-
tistical signiﬁcance. In addition, sometimes we created an emit-
ter not falling into any of the groups deﬁned above. We believe
that these are contaminating ﬂuorescent molecules adsorbed onto
the surface of hBN. Their emission is typically much weaker and
their spectrum broader compared to the other emitters (see Fig-
ure 2(e)).
Atomic localization of quantum emitters
With 93 quantum emitters fabricated and characterized, we could
utilize the atomic etching of hBN, removing one layer at a
time. After each cumulative plasma etching step, the ﬂakes were
scanned again and we checked if the defect survived (see Sup-
porting Information, Figure S2 for the process ﬂow). It is pos-
sible that this etching creates new emitters, but at the layer-by-
layer etching parameters, we expect the linear defect formation
density to be ∼0.02µm−1 (i.e. one defect forms on average per
50µm crystal edge length)18. Thus, it is unlikely that an emitter
is removed and at the same time a new one forms at the same

DOI: 10.1039/C9NR04269Elocation. In addition, as the photophysics of the defects vary sub-
stantially, it would be even more unlikely that a newly created
emitter that formed at the location of a previous emitter has sim-
ilar photophysical properties (in terms of e.g. ZPL, lifetime, and
dipole orientation). In fact, we did see occasionally new defects
appear at new locations, but they are not counted toward the
statistics in this study. The histogram of the number layer after
which the defect disappeared is shown in Figure 3(a). The best ﬁt
to any univariate distribution reveals a Poisson distribution with
a mean of 3.8. This means that the emitters are very close to the
surface.
When looking at how the photophysics evolve as the top layers
are successively etched, it becomes clear that the emission is sta-
ble until the emitter is removed (see Figure 3(b)). The photolu-
minescence does not decrease gradually nor change its lineshape
or other photophysical properties. Rather the PL from the de-
fects disappears suddenly entirely, and for all upon removal. This
means the quantum emitters are well isolated within one layer
with no appreciable inter-layer interaction. In principle, it is pos-
sible the wave function of the trapped charge carrier is spread
over multiple layers, thus the defect could enter a dark state even
if some layers above the layer containing the chemical defect are
etched (while the defect itself is not etched yet). There is, how-
ever, no further evidence supporting this conjecture. In addition,
all the emitters with ZPLs falling not into one of the categories in
the histogram in Figure 2(d) disappeared after the ﬁrst etching
step. This is evidence for the fact that these emitters are indeed
surface contaminants. As expected, the Raman shift after each
etching step remained constant, indicating that there is not much
strain in the crystal, which would relax as the layers are etched.
One could argue emitters that are counted as etched actually just
enter a dark state temporarily. This is very unlikely, as previous
experiments found during the time when the emitter is in the dark
state there is still light emission from the defect, but usually it is
much weaker compared to the normal emission34,45.
The extracted layer number is believed to be highly accurate.
Assuming a failure probability ≤0.1% (see above) results in a
success probability of 77.2% that all layer numbers are correct
(in total there were 258 etching steps). However, as all samples
were etched at the same time, there is a chance that if one pro-
cess failed, many samples would be affected. A process fail could
be that it took a longer time for the plasma to ignite or to stabi-
lize the gases (both ignition and stabilization happens at a higher
plasma power, which is subsequently regulated down to the set
power), so to exclude this possibility the plasma parameters are
recorded in-situ.
The results so far prove emitters (formed by oxygen plasma
treatment) are always very close to the surface. This raises a few
questions: (1) Why are the emitters close to the surface? (2)
Are emitters always close to the surface, or does this depend on
the defect formation method? (3) Is this an explanation for the
shorter excited state lifetime of the plasma treated quantum emit-
ters?
The dominant ion species in the plasma is O2+ (at lower pres-
sure and higher power O+ becomes more dominant). The ex-
pected ion energy during the defect formation plasma treatment
is ∼10eV. Unfortunately, this ion energy is too low for Monte
Carlo methods like SRIM46, preventing an accurate calculation
of the projected ion range in matter (in this case hBN). However,
in our case the plasma treatment is a chemical and not physical
process.
This means the process is mostly limited to the crys-
tal surface, as the ions have only low kinetic energy and cannot
penetrate deep into the crystal. The kinetic energy of the ions is
similar to the defect formation energy in hBN, which is on the
order of a few eV47. Moreover, the OB and ON defect have forma-
tion energies of 5.19 and 2.20eV, respectively, so they could easily
be produced by the ions48. The oxygen radicals are highly reac-
tive and are thus likely producing defects. It was recently pointed
out, however, that it is unclear whether the defects are actually
created using the plasma processing or one of the many other
methods, or if preexisting, initially dark defects are activated via
modiﬁcation or restructuring of the crystal environment49. Both
options are possible and our data so far does not allow to favor
one over the other explanation.
While the oxygen plasma only acts onto the crystal surface, de-
fect diffusion is also an important consideration. Without the ex-
act knowledge of the chemical defect structure this is impossible
to estimate, but at least a few things are known: First, hBN has
strong sp2-hybridized covalent bonds, so the defect diffusion ac-
tivation energy (that is the energy required to move along the
reaction path) is rather large. It is expected that diffusion is pre-
dominantly in-plane and not inter-layer due to the direct in-plane
bonds, so diffusion deep into the crystal is not likely. For hBN,
due to the heteronuclear structure, defect diffusion is partially
suppressed, as homonuclear B-B and N-N are energetically unfa-
vorable (these homonuclear bonds are temporarily formed as the
defects moves along the reaction path)50. This results in a lower
vacancy migration compared to homonuclear graphene. The dif-
fusion activation energy calculated with DFT range from 2.6 to
6.0eV at 0K for vacancies and divacancies, with the structures of-
ten relaxing to their initial conﬁguration50. This already shows
the smaller defect diffusion. Furthermore, at the rapid anneal-
ing temperature of 850◦C (in this experiment), only the boron
vacancy has a diffusion coefﬁcient larger than 1Å2s−1 50. Future
calculations have to show how the diffusion of other point-like
complexes scales. It is worth noting, that the result of the defect
diffusion activation energy from DFT calculations shows a small
dependency on the speciﬁcally used pseudopotential51.
To address the second question, we repeat the experiment
with emitters fabricated with electron irradiation23,24. The elec-
tron accelerating voltage was 10kV with an electron ﬂuence of
∼1018 cm−2. Given the thickness of the hBN ﬂakes being ≪1µm,
the kinetic energy of the electrons is sufﬁcient to fully transmit
through the hBN crystals (see Supporting Information, Figure
S3(a)). The energy loss of the electrons is dominated by colli-
sions with the boron and nitrogen nuclei, as the radiative stopping
power is much smaller at 10keV kinetic electron energy (see Sup-
porting Information, Figure S3(b)). Therefore, bremsstrahlung
does not play any role. With the projected range of the electrons
being 1.4µm at 10keV, it is expected that emitters created or ac-
tivated by electron irradiation are not exclusively near the crystal
surface. Monte Carlo simulations of electron trajectories through

DOI: 10.1039/C9NR04269Ethe hBN crystal (see Supporting Information, Figure S3(c,d)) also
conﬁrm this. Repeating the atomic etching on these new emitters
conﬁrms this, as none of the emitters was found within the ﬁrst
ten layers, and the emitters being randomly positioned within the
crystal. Etching at much larger steps (∼10s of layers at a time,
even though we note this was not calibrated sufﬁciently) shows
that defects created by electron irradiation are formed through-
out the crystal (see Figure 3(c)).
More precisely, the emitters
form not exclusively at the crystal edges or dislocations anymore,
in agreement with previous experiments24. Interestingly, the ex-
cited state lifetime of these emitters is typically longer compared
to the plasma etched ones, with lifetimes ranging from 2 −3ns
(see Supporting Information, Figure S4 for a characterization of
quantum emitters created under electron irradiation).
Theoretical modeling
Finally, we address the third question.
Within the crystal, the
photon density of states is decreased compared to vacuum. This
is a Purcell-like effect, where the radiative lifetime is modiﬁed
as the dielectric environment changes. The Purcell factor ε as a
function of emitter distance to the surface d is calculated using
ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations (see Methods)
and shown is in Figure 3(d). The Purcell factor (and thus the ex-
cited state lifetime of an ideal dipole) oscillates and reaches 1 in
the limit d ≫λ. In this limit there is no enhancement or suppres-
sion. It becomes clear that this effect only makes up a few percent
in lifetime changes, so this alone cannot explain the shorter life-
time. It is still noteworthy, that there is enhancement very close to
the surface, while deeper (45−145nm) there is suppression. The
electric ﬁeld mode proﬁles in both limits show the emitter deep
within hBN emits like an ideal dipole, while the emitter at the sur-
face emits stronger into the crystal than into vacuum (see Figure
3(e,f)). This means the actual emitter brightness is even larger
than experiments so far suggest. For emitters in cavities52, this
does not matter, as both directions are captured by the cavity. As
the different lifetime is not solely due to a Purcell-like effect, we
use density functional theory calculations to investigate if surface
states could be the cause for the shorter lifetime. We calculate the
electronic band structure of hBN for one (1L), ten (10L), and 100
layers (100L) of hBN (see Figure 3(g-i)). The calculations show,
that as more layers are added also more energy bands are added.
Due to layer-layer interactions these bands spread, but there are
no genuine isolated surface bands introduced into the band gap.
This implies that, unless the defect levels are very close to one of
the band edges, surface states do not inﬂuence the lifetime of the
defect. Therefore, we conclude that the shorter defect lifetime in
our experiments is likely due to interaction with surface defects
introducing additional decay pathways, or with surface phonons
making existing decay pathways faster. It is worth noting, differ-
ent defect structures, if involved, would most likely exhibit differ-
ent lifetimes as well. Finally, the fact that the lifetime is constant
during the layer-by-layer etching (see above) does not contradict
our model, as the close distance to the surface makes lifetime
changes too small (i.e. the lifetime change from an emitter being
in layer number 2 to an emitter being in layer number 1 would
be hardly measurable).
Conclusions
In this work, we have developed deterministic atomically layer-
by-layer etching of hBN with an oxygen plasma. This was utilized
to destructively localize quantum emitters hosted by hBN. We
found that emitters fabricated by a different plasma process are
always very close to the surface, within a few layers, while emit-
ters fabricated by intense electron irradiation are located through-
out the entire crystal thickness. For both creation methods, emit-
ters are more likely to form at ﬂake edges and grain boundaries.
It is notable that they also form away from these domains, in
what appears to be undistorted crystal. Creation near the surface
is a likely explanation for the shorter excited state lifetime hBN
quantum emitters exhibit when fabricated by plasma etching. The
emitter lifetime is inﬂuenced by additional decay pathways intro-
duced by surface defects, or interactions with surface phonons
making existing decay pathways faster. In contrast, emitters deep
within the crystal have lifetimes ∼3−6 times longer, as they are
well isolated from the environment and surface effects.
Considering now the implications that our observations have
for the identity of the quantum emitters. Our etching study is
consistent with the conﬁnement of the emitting defect to a single
layer, as per past observation of the emitters in monolayer sam-
ples13. The creation of deep defects away from a boundary by
electron irradiation is an important observation. It implies that
the defect can be a product of radiation damage and so is fur-
ther evidence that it involves a vacancy or interstitial. Speciﬁcally
either a nitrogen vacancy VN, a boron-vacancy VB, an intralayer
interstitial or an interlayer interstitial. To identify which, we need
to interpret the effects of annealing.
At our annealing temperature of 850◦C, it is known that the
VB is mobile, whilst VN is not. It is reasonable to expect that
the interlayer interstitials are also mobile due to the low inter-
layer bond energies of the material. Upon annealing, we observe
improved photostability and linewidth, but no signiﬁcant change
in the number of emitters18. We attribute the improved optical
properties to the removal of interstitials and single VB, which we
expect to lead to an improved charge stability and reduced elec-
trical noise since these defects likely act as donors or acceptors.
If the density of the VB created by the radiation is low, then our
annealing observation would imply that the defect does not in-
volve VB. This is because if the defects were single VB, then the
number of emitters would decrease with annealing, and if it were
a complex involving one or more VB, then the number of emit-
ters would increase until saturation of the other constituents of
the complex (i.e. VN or impurities). However, we are not nec-
essarily drawing this conclusion here, since our intense electron
irradiation may have rather created a very high density of VB,
which even without annealing, could have saturated the creation
of emitters (i.e. by creating VB in close proximity to VN or an
impurity). In this case, the defect may well involve VB. Unfortu-
nately, we cannot determine which VB density limit our radiation
produced because there is insufﬁcient information about the VB
creation cross-section for electron radiation. Future work should
focus on establishing the VB density created before annealing and

DOI: 10.1039/C9NR04269Erelating this to the creation / destruction / no change of emitters
during annealing to establish whether or not VB is involved in the
defect.
The creation of the defects by the oxygen plasma may imply
that the defect involves oxygen impurities through their incorpo-
ration at the surface. Generalizing this hypothesis to the creation
of deep emitters by electron irradiation, this would imply that
oxygen is also a deep impurity in our samples. This appears rea-
sonable given that O may also form similar sp2 bonds as B and
N if it can donate an electron to a nearby acceptor. Future work
should seek to combine variation of oxygen impurity and radi-
ation damage to ascertain whether the defect is indeed an O-V
complex.
The results might also allow for a direct identiﬁcation of the de-
fect, as the knowledge of optically active defects very close to the
surface might allow for imaging with high-resolution tunneling
electron microscopes. A full understanding of the defect nature is
required for tuning and engineering speciﬁc properties that will
ultimately lead to a wider applicability in various scenarios.
Methods
Plasma etching
The oxygen plasma was generated from a microwave ﬁeld (PVA
TePla).
Prior to any experiments, the plasma chamber was
cleaned for 5min at 500W to remove any contaminants.
We
found the optimal single layer etching conditions empirically at
a plasma power of 102W for 63s at a pressure of 0.332mbar and
a gas ﬂow rate of 300cm3/min (deviating from this by 10% de-
creases the success probability). All experiments were carried our
at room temperature. The plasma time includes about 2−3s dur-
ing which the plasma ignites and the gases are stabilized. The
plasma ﬁeld is highly anisotropic and varies across the plasma
chamber. Thus, for repeatable results it is crucial to place the
substrates always at the same position in the chamber. Unless
stated otherwise, this position is at the plasma ﬁeld minimum. It
should be mentioned that the optimal parameters reported here
depend on the speciﬁc gas pump, plasma generator and geometry
of the chamber, which requires to optimize these parameters on
every other system individually.
Fabrication and optical characterization
Thin ﬂakes of hBN were mechanically exfoliated from bulk crys-
tal (used as received from HQGraphene) to a viscoelastic stamp
(Gel-Pak WF-40-X4) using the tape method. Crystals with thick-
nesses down to ∼5nm can be identiﬁed by optical contrast with
a standard optical microscope and are subsequently transferred
by dry contact to a Si substrate with a 262nm thermally grown
oxide layer.
For the quantum emitters, we used crystals with
thicknesses ranging from ∼5 −100nm. The emitters were cre-
ated during an oxygen plasma etching step at 200W for 1min in
the plasma ﬁeld maximum (at a pressure of 0.332mbar and a gas
ﬂow rate of 300cm3/min). These are harsher plasma conditions
than the layer-by-layer plasma etching, but ensures a higher de-
fect density. Moreover, the defect density is linearly proportional
to the plasma power18. After the plasma treatment, the samples
are rapidly thermally annealed at 850◦C in an Ar atmosphere at
a gas ﬂow rate of 500cm3/min. The electron irradiated emitters
have been fabricated using a scanning electron microscope in an
FEI Helios 600 NanoLab, where the electrons were accelerated
using a high voltage of 10kV. The samples were irradiated with
a ﬂuence of f = 1018 cm−2, which was calculated with f = I·t
e·A,
where I is the electron current, t is the frame time, e is the elec-
tron charge, and A is the frame area. The irradiation took place
at room temperature at a pressure < 2.2mPa. After electron irra-
diation, the emitters were not thermally annealed24. For emitter
localization, a custom-built µPL setup was used which utilized an
ultrashort-pulsed 522nm laser with a pulse length of 300fs at a
repetition rate of 20.8MHz. The laser was focused to the diffrac-
tion limit with a Olympus 100×/0.9 dry objective and the samples
were scanned using Newport translation stages with a spatial res-
olution up to 0.2µm. The emission was collected in-reﬂection for
1s through the same objective and frequency-ﬁltered using Sem-
rock RazorEdge ultrasteep long-pass edge ﬁlters. The light is cou-
pled via a grating to either a CCD or a single-photon avalanche
diode (SPAD) from Micro Photon Devices allowing to extract the
spectrum or the temporally and spectrally resolved photolumines-
cence. The correlation between excitation pulse and arrival time
of the ﬂuorescence photon is given by a PicoHarp 300. For mea-
suring the second-order correlation function we utilize another
diode laser at 512nm and two SPADs.
Finite-difference time-domain simulations
The ﬁnite difference time-domain simulations were performed
using Lumerical FDTD Solutions, a commercial grade simulator
based on the FDTD method53. To calculate the Purcell enhance-
ment and emitter dynamics, an in-plane dipole emitter at 560nm
was deﬁned in the center within a slab of hBN, with a dielectric
constant of 3.42 at 532nm (this was obtained from experiments).
The slab was thinned down from one direction (which is equiv-
alent to moving the emitter to the surface) and the Purcell en-
hancement as well as the electric ﬁeld mode proﬁle was recorded
for each crystal thickness. A dynamic mesh was chosen to capture
all potential emitter dynamics. The simulations assume perfectly
matched layer boundary conditions, which are reﬂectionless or
absorbing boundaries, to account for the ﬁnite memory size.
Density functional theory calculations
The DFT calculations have been performed with QuantumATK
with the Virtual NanoLab front end54,55.
QuantumATK uti-
lizes numerical linear combination of atomic orbitals basis sets
and the density matrix for closed or periodic systems is calcu-
lated by diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Mono-
layer hBN crystals have been deﬁned using a supercell contain-
ing two atoms and the geometry has been optimized using a
21 × 21 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack reciprocal space grid. The optimiza-
tion converged when all forces were below 0.001eVÅ−1. The elec-
tron exchange-correlation was described with the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in the generalized gradient approxi-
mation56. For all atoms a double zeta polarized basis set was cho-
sen and band structure was routed along high symmetry points.

thickness changed only marginally, by less than 0.22nm. After one additional minute at 100 (CF4), the thickness further decreased by 0.22nm. After
three additional minutes at 500W (CF4) in the plasma ﬁeld maximum, the thinning was substantial with 12.49nm decrease. The error bars are shorter
than the size of the symbols. A signiﬁcant change in the SiO2 thickness would change the OPL.

is normalized and vertically offset for clarity. (c) The second-order correlation function dips to 0.142(37), 0.196(53) and 0.234(44) at zero time delay
(obtained from ﬁts). There was no background correction applied. The re-emission peaks are present, but not visible on the scales displayed. The
data is normalized such that g(2)(τ →∞) = 1 and vertically offset for clarity. (d) Histogram of the distribution of zero phonon lines from 93 defects. The
ZPLs bunch around 560nm (group 1, blue), 590nm (group 2, green) and 640nm (group 3, red). It is believed that defects falling into neither of these
categories (excluded area, grayed out) originates from surface contaminants. (e) Sample spectrum of such an emitter from the excluded area in (d).
The emission of these emitters is typically comparably weak and broad.

Fig. 3 Atomic localization of quantum emitters. (a) Probability density of locating the emitters in layer N (i.e. it disappeared after N etching steps). The
average value is 3.8. The black points are the best ﬁt to any univariate distribution (here a Poisson distribution). The emitters have been created by
oxygen plasma treatment. (b) Spectral evolution of one emitter as consecutive layers are removed from the top side. The emission line is relatively
stable and suddenly fully disappears after the fourth etching step. (c) Probability density of locating the emitters in layer N (i.e. it disappeared after
N etching steps). The emitters have been created by electron irradiation. (d) FDTD simulations of the Purcell effect of a dipole emitter close to the
hBN-vacuum interface. The emitter lifetime or Purcell factor ε oscillates as the emitter gets moved deeper into the crystal. In the limit of d ≫λ there
is no enhancement or suppression and the electric ﬁeld mode proﬁle in this limit is shown in (e). For the limit d ≪λ the electric ﬁeld mode proﬁle is
shown in (f). The emission is stronger into the crystal than into the vacuum (as the crystal has a higher dielectric constant). (g-i) DFT calculations of
the band structure routed along high-symmetry points for 1L, 10L, and 100L hBN, respectively. Due to layer-layer interactions the bands added by the
layers spread, but no deep energy band appears, meaning that the interaction with surface states is likely low.
