The essence of strongly correlated materials stems from com-
petition among symmetry-broken quantum states, such as 
high-temperature superconductivity, and charge-, spin- and 
orbital-ordered phases [1]. Among many strongly correlated 
materials, colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganites are a 
prototypical system with complex couplings among charge, 
orbital, spin, and lattice orders. It is generally believed that 
local lattice distortions of the MnO6 octahedra accompany 
anti-ferromagnetic, charge- and orbital- ordered (COO) phases 
on the one hand, and the mixed-valence character promotes 
metallic ferromagnetic double exchange on the other hand. 
The transport properties are determined by the mutual com-
petition of these phases. They have been widely studied due 
to the intriguing physics and technological potential for mag-
netic memory, logic, etc., arising from their half-metallicity 
controllable via both magnetic field and light. By directly or 
indirectly modifying different degrees of freedom, a plethora 
of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of using 
ultrafast laser pulses to create and probe novel transient states 
that are inaccessible via adiabatic or static thermal methods 
[2–4].
Manganites come in several families of structures. The 
reduced dimensionality in bilayer manganites (La2−2xSr1+2x 
Mn2O7) [5, 6] amplifies the effect of entropy change in the tem-
perature regime near the phase transitions and offers a unique 
opportunity to study the ordering dynamics. For x close to 
0.5, a COO insulator phase is sandwiched between a low-
temperature antiferromagnetic metallic (AFMM) phase and 
a high-temperature (>220 K) paramagnetic metallic (PMM) 
phase (figure 1(a)). The AFMM phase transforms into the

Abstract
We show evidence that the competition between the antiferromagetic metallic phase and the 
charge- and orbital-ordered insulating phase at the reentrant phase boundary of a layered 
manganite, La0.99Sr2.01Mn2O7, can be manipulated using ultrafast optical excitation. The time-
dependent evolution of the Jahn–Teller superlattice reflection, which indicates the formation 
of the charge and orbital order, was measured at different laser fluences. The laser-induced 
enhancement and reduction the Jahn–Teller reflection intensity shows a reversal of sign 
between earlier (~10 ns) and later (~150 ns) time delays during the relaxation after photo 
excitation. This effect is consistent with a scenario whereby the laser excitation modulates the 
local competition between the metallic and the insulating phases.

COO phase when the transition temperature is approached 
from below, representing a spin-charge order critical phase 
point observed only in a few manganite compounds [7–10]. 
At x ~ 0.5, the COO is of checkerboard form characterized 
by a 4  ×  4 superlattice, whereas at x ~ 0.6, the COO has been 
shown by x-ray resonant scattering to adopt a bistripe-order 
of a 5  ×  5 superlattice [11–13]. There are many studies, under 
adiabatic or static conditions, on the complex ground states in 
the AFMM phase [14, 15], the formation of the COO [11–13] 
the COO-associated Jahn–Teller (JT) distortion [11, 12], and 
the correlation between the magnetization and the transport 
properties [16, 17].
In this paper, we report evidence of non-thermal dynamic 
control of the metallic and the COO insulator phases in the 
x  =  0.505 compound using ultrafast laser pulses by measuring 
the COO-associated JT distortion dynamics. By varying the 
laser fluence we were able to either enhance or reduce the 
transient JT x-ray reflection, which is consistent with photo-
induced mutual phase conversion between the metallic and 
insulator phases. This phase conversion has been studied in 
Pr0.55(Ca0.75Sr0.25)0.45MnO3 thin film samples [9, 10] via mon-
itoring the transport and optical spectroscopy. The current 
pump–probe experiment provides direct structural evidence of 
the competition between the photoexcited metallic and COO 
insulator phases.
LaSr2Mn2O7 has a tetragonal structure with a  =  b  =  3.87 Å  
and c  =  20.1 Å. The sample, 2 mm by 2.5 mm by 0.7 mm 
in size, was grown using the floating zone technique [18].  
A phase diagram around x  =  0.5 is shown in figure 1(a). The 
sample surface is naturally cleaved. The magnetization was 
characterized by a SQUID magnetometer. The x-ray measure-
ments were conducted at the 7-ID beam line at the Advanced 
Photon Source (APS) [19].
The static temperature dependence of the COO was meas-
ured at the (0.75 1.25 6) JT superlattice reflection that is due 
to the localization of the Mn3+ eg electrons [11, 12]. The tem-
perature dependence of the JT reflection intensity is compared 
with the magnetization in figures 1(b) and (c). The comparison 
is very similar to that between the transport and the magneti-
zation (figure 2 in [17]), but with a transitional temperature 
region (labelled as TR throughout this paper) between 100 
and 135 K, where the JT reflection gradually increases to the 
maximum. The JT superlattice reflection peak position was 
observed to have a negligible dependence on the temperature.
For the pump–probe measurement, the sample was cooled 
down to 16 K and then raised to and kept at 49 K in a Displex 
cryogenic stage, putting the system on the warming loop of 
figure  1(c). Laser pulses with duration less than 100 fs at 
800 nm (1.55 eV) were delivered to the sample at normal inci-
dence through a fused silica window at a repetition rate of 
5 kHz, with a spot size of about 2.5 mm by 2 mm (full width 
at half maximum). The laser penetration depth was estimated 
to be about ~50 nm using the optical data for a composi-
tion with close doping level from [20]. To match the x-ray  
(12 keV) and laser penetration depths, the x-ray incidence angle  
was set at 0.22° (supplementary document: stacks.iop.org/
JPhysCM/27/495602/mmedia). Note that the scattering geom-
etry is asymmetric and the x-ray exit angle is 19°. An example 
of the diffraction peak is depicted in figure 1(d), showing a 
broad, but well-defined peak with no spurious contamination.
The experiment was performed in the 24-bunch mode of 
the APS with a bunch-to-bunch spacing of 153 ns. An ava-
lanche photodiode gated at the laser repetition rate of 5 kHz

with 4 gates was used to record the diffraction data. For the 
‘early’ channel, the gate was set to observe the bunch that 
coincided with the laser pump pulse. The ‘late’ channel was 
further delayed by 153 ns to gate the next bunch in the storage 
ring. Two additional gates were set at 3.682 μs before the 
early and late channels, i.e. one round trip of the storage ring 
prior, to measure the ‘no-laser’ signal from the same photon 
bunches. The incoming beam intensity was also monitored for 
normalization of the x-ray counts. The x-ray pulse duration 
was about 100 ps. Further details of the diffraction measure-
ments are provided in the supplementary materials (stacks.
iop.org/JPhysCM/27/495602/mmedia).
The pump–probe measurement was performed by changing 
the time delay of the laser pump relative to the x-ray probe at 
several laser fluences. The ‘no-laser’ JT diffraction signal at 
(0.75 1.25 6) was found to be nontrivially dependent on the 
laser fluence, shown in figure 2. This is the intensity I of the 
JT reflection at 3.68 μs before the arrival of the laser pulse or, 
equivalently, 196 μs after the previous laser pulse. This ‘no-
laser’ JT reflection was stable during the measurement at each 
laser fluence (lasts about 25 min), as shown in figure 2 by the 
error bars.
This fluence dependence of the JT reflection has features 
somewhat similar to its temperature dependence in figure 1(c), 
indicating a slow recovery of the sample from the laser excita-
tion. The change of the JT intensity is likely a convolution of 
changes in the JT structure factor and the relative population 
of the COO phase representing an effective ‘initial state’ for 
the pump–probe measurement.

, 
i.e. the signal with the ‘no-laser’ signal (figure 2) subtracted, 
is presented in figure 3 at several laser fluencies as a function 
of delay between the laser and the x-ray. Positive or negative 
signals indicate an enhancement or reduction of the JT reflec-
tion, respectively. ΔI depends on both the delay and the laser 
fluence, which is summarized in figure 4, showing the average 
difference signal in the time windows of 5–10 ns (early) and 
158–163 ns (late) after the laser excitation. For all fluences, 
ΔI before laser pulse is essentially zero. Note that the signal 
level of a few percent can be compared with the excitation 
efficiency estimated from the laser fluence, i.e. about 6% Mn 
ions in the top 50 nm probed layer can be excited at 1 mJ cm−2 
(40 photons per nm2) assuming 100% absorption (see sup-
plementary document: stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/27/495602/
mmedia).
There is a striking feature in figure 4: the early and the late 
ΔI have opposite signs. At low laser fluencies (<3.3 mJ cm−2), 
the early ΔI is positive but the late ΔI is negative. At fluencies 
between 4.2 and 6.3 mJ cm−2, a zero or negative early ΔI is 
observed, albeit accompanied by a positive late ΔI. Clearly 
the laser excitation can enhance or reduce the JT reflection 
instantaneously, but the relaxation that follows can reverse 
this trend in 150 ns.
To understand the result in figure 4, it is critical to charac-
terize the pseudo ground state as a function of the laser flu-
ence, as shown in figure 2. To do this, we assume that after 
0.2 ms, residual heating effect dominates the sample bulk. 
Thus we apply a two-temperature, 1D thermal heat diffusion 
model for the actual sample thickness of about 0.7 mm, for 
which the detail is given in SI (see supplementary document: 
stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/27/495602/mmedia).
The simulation is benchmarked by the 7.74 mJ cm−2 case. 
We note in the data shown in figure 3, the JT intensity has 
an instantaneous drop (<100 ps), of about 15%, followed by 
a slow decrease over more than 100 ns. The instantaneous 
reduction can be assigned as non-thermal, photon excitation of 
the COO states that destroys the JT distortion. The relaxation 
of these excited states, however, leads to slow heating of the 
sample partially beyond the COO-PMM transition tempera-
ture (TCP) thus further decrease of the JT intensity. Therefore, 
the sample temperature before the laser pulse must be below 
TCP at 220 K. The later time (160 ns) temperature, however, 
must exceeds TCP for the JT intensity to further decrease. 
Using the thermal simulation, we can determine a total 
heating efficiency, i.e. the percentage of photon energy that 
converts to heat, of 36%. The spatial temporal evolution of the 
bulk temperature is shown in figure 5(a) using a CW simula-
tion (for detailed explanation, see the supplementary informa-
tion), where the sample temperature reaches an equilibrium 
at 180 K within 2 s. The corresponding temperature evolution

due to pulsed laser excitation (assuming all absorbed laser 
energy converts to heat immediately) is shown in figure 5(b). 
The temperature as a function of the laser fluence is shown 
in figure 5(c), where the temperature for the first 100 nm of 
the sample before, at 8 ns (early) and 160 ns (late) after the 
laser exposure are given. We can see that at a fluence above 
4 mJ cm−2, if all the energy is immediately converted to heat, 
the temperature would be higher than TCP, leading to 100% 
reduction of the JT reflection, contradicting the experiment 
observation. This confirms that the instantaneous excitation is 
non-thermal. For the 7.7 mJ cm−2 case the late temperature is 
slightly above TCP. These simulations also indicate that after 
the initial excitation, the sample has a tendency to heat up 
probably due to the relaxation of the excited states via phonon 
emission.
The thermal simulation confirms that the state before 
each laser exposure is indeed thermally stabilized, which 
allows a direct comparison of the initial state to the static 
mapping of the JT intensity to a temperature dependence, 
as shown in figure 2(b). It shows a clear trend of the ini-
tial dominating phase shifting from AMM to COO phases 
as laser fluence increases. Interestingly, the JT reflection 
reaches its maximum intensity in the TR region and does 
not directly correlate with the temperature dependence of the 
static peak intensity; the measured intensities are, however, 
within a factor of two of those in the COO phase. Due to 
the stable signal we observed at each laser fluence, this is 
not likely due to experiment errors. However, the underlying 
physics needs further study. We also noticed the JT signal at 
laser fluence lower than 1 mJ cm−2, which we attribute to the 
laser excitation of a lower temperature phase with JT distor-
tion that is stable at temperature lower than 75 K as reported 
in [11, 15].
With the initial condition determined, and noting that non-
thermal photo excitation has been observed to convert metal 
into insulator [10, 21, 22] and vice versa in other manganites

in the 4.2 and 4.8 mJ cm−2 data are due to beam losses. The ‘early’ 
and ‘late’ time windows are shaded. The x-ray beam is controlled 
and monitored by a set of beam position monitor feedbacks and the 
beam loss does not change the beam size, beam alignment, or the 
timing between the laser and x-ray. It did not otherwise affect the 
data collection.

and oxides [9, 23, 24], we propose that the observed phe-
nomena in figure 4 is evidence of photon driven phase com-
petition between the metallic and the insulating phases. 
We propose that the quasi-equilibrated ‘initial state’ before 
the arrival of the laser pulse is phase-separated, a common 
scene in many strongly correlated oxides [1], with coexisting 
AFMM and COO clusters up to the AMM-COO phase transi-
tion at about TAC  =  136 K.
In this case, both AFMM-to-COO and the COO-to-metal 
phase conversions occur upon laser excitation at least up to 
TAC as has been reported in previous experiments [9, 10]. 
The former conversion will enhance and the latter will reduce 
the intensity of the JT reflection. The net change in the JT 
reflection immediately after the laser pulse is determined 
by the fraction of each phase, denoted as nI and nM, for the 
insulating and the metallic phase, respectively, in the ‘initial 
state’ and the relative rates of COO-AFMM and AFMM-COO 
excitation, denoted as B and A, respectively. Qualitatively, if

leading to an immediate enhancement of the JT reflection. 
When

M
I, however, more COO clusters will be melted 
than generated, thus resulting in a net immediate reduction of 
the JT intensity. At the same time, the initial fractional con-
tribution is dependent on the equilibrium temperature of the 
sample and due to the surrounding structure and spin ‘pres-
sure’, as coined in [9, 10]. It is expected that the newly gen-
erated non-dominant phase clusters, i.e. COO clusters at a 
low laser fluence and metallic clusters at a high laser fluence, 
decay faster than the newly generated dominant phase clus-
ters, i.e. AFMM clusters at a low fluence and COO clusters 
at a high fluence. Our experiments are not able to determine 
the final form of the local electronic state immediately after 
melting of the COO clusters. At a low laser fluence, it is likely 
spin-ordered due to the low temperature dominant AFMM 
phase or will become spin-ordered soon due to surrounding 
‘spin pressure’ [9]. At a high laser fluence, these metallic clus-
ters can be PMM.
Based on this argument, we can now qualitatively interpret 
the observations in figure 4. At low laser fluence the JT reflec-
tion is enhanced immediately after the laser excitation because 
more COO insulator clusters are generated than destroyed 
as the initial state is dominated by the AFMM phase, i.e.

I. The difference signal turns negative later when these 
laser-generated COO clusters decay while the laser-generated 
metallic clusters stay. At high fluence, the behaviors of the 
newly generated COO and metallic phases reverse, and the 
opposite trend is seen. It is expected that the trend reverses 
at an initial state where 
≈

I. Our data also indicate a 
relaxation time of the laser-generated non-dominant phase of 
about 100–200 ns.
Non-thermal mechanisms modifying both local spin order 
and the COO phase due to photo excitation have been widely 
discussed in the literature though the details are still under dis-
cussion. The complication here is the competition between the 
COO insulating and the spin-ordered metallic phases. Melting 
of the COO phase [9, 23–25] is likely due to charge transfer 
of t2g electrons into the eg orbit thru either an intra-site [26]

based on the benchmark using the data at 7.7 mJ cm−2. For fluence 
larger than 4.5 mJ cm−2, the early temperature would far exceed 
the COO-PMM transition temperature, excluding heating as the 
possible cause of the early signal.

or an inter-site [27, 28] d–d transition, leading to an increase 
of the electron itinerancy which couples to the phonon and 
releases the JT distortion. Evidence further shows that it is 
also possible to induce magnetization in manganites via photo- 
excitation [25, 29]; thus in the low fluence AFMM-dominated 
phase, the surrounding spin ‘pressure’ may coalesce the 
metallic clusters into the spin-ordered phase. At the high flu-
ence COO-dominated phase, melting routes to either PMM or 
AFMM phases are possible. The formation of the COO phase 
is accompanied by melting of the AFMM spin order, i.e. fer-
romagnetic order in the a–b plane. It is suggested that a non-
thermal melting of the spin order [10] can be accomplished 
via photo induced spin-flip for the eg electrons against the 
Hund coupling energy [30, 31]. This spin flip may lead, within 
the ferromagnetic plane, to a local spin correlation favored by 
the COO and the JT distortion.
The physical picture of photon manipulation of the com-
petition between the metallic and the insulating phases [9, 10] 
qualitatively explains the dynamic behavior. In this picture it 
is however surprising to still observe an early positive signal 
at laser fluence of 3.4 mJ cm−2, e.g. in the transitional region 
where 
≈
n
n
M
I, which increases even further at 4.2 mJ cm−2. 
This could be an indication that the insulating-metallic phase 
excitation rate B is significantly smaller than the metallic-
insulating phase excitation rate A and that it is temperature 
dependent. Furthermore, this anomaly may also be related to 
a change of the penetration depth of the laser as the sample 
is going through the phase transition. We note that although 
bilayer manganite presents an array of exotic properties, 
there is surprisingly very limited study of dynamic proper-
ties and this work is, to our knowledge, the first study of such 
dynamics of this material. Clearly, further effort is needed to 
understand the result. It will be very illuminating to selec-
tively excite the lattice at the stretched mode at 17 μm [32] in 
either the metallic or the COO-dominated phase to clarify the 
role of lattice distortion in facilitating the complex coupling 
and competition in the system [2, 4, 33].
In summary, we have shown evidence of the dynamic com-
petition between spin and charge order in the bilayer man-
ganite La0.99Sr2.01Mn2O7. Our result is qualitatively consistent 
with a scenario wherein non-thermal laser excitation leads 
to the transient modulation of the relative fractions of the 
metallic and the COO insulating phases in an effective phase-
separated initial state. It also shows that the relative relaxa-
tion time is important in determining system dynamics. The 
experiment suggests the feasibility of controlling the competi-
tion between the two phases at a much faster time scale than 
previously observed [9, 10].
