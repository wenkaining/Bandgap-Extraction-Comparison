The biphenylene network (BPN) is notable in recent fabrication efforts to design new 2D materials. The
stability of its boron nitride counterpart, BN-BPN, has been confirmed through numerical investigations. In
this study, we conducted a density functional theory (DFT) analysis to examine the mechanical, electronic,
thermodynamic, and optical properties of two other group-III counterparts of BPN: gallium nitride (BPN-GaN)
and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). Our findings reveal that the band gap values for BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN
are 2.3 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively, at the HSE06 level. Phonon- and energy-formation calculations and ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations suggest that BPN-(Al,Ga)N has good structural and dynamic
stabilities. BPN-GaN displayed negative phonon frequencies. However, results from AIMD simulations point
to its structural integrity with no bond reconstructions at 1000 K. These materials exhibit noteworthy UV
activity, promising prospects as UV collectors. The thermodynamic properties reveal that the heat capacity
of both BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN increases with temperature, eventually reaching the Dulong‚ÄìPetit limit at
around 800 K. We also performed calculations to determine the electron- and hole-effective masses, charge
carrier mobility, elastic stiffness constants, Young‚Äôs modulus, and Poisson ratio for both BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN,
providing valuable insight into their electronic and mechanical properties.
1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of nanoelectronics has spurred the explo-
ration of novel materials with unique properties to meet the evolving
demands of high-performance electronic devices [1,2]. In this context,
free-standing 2D hexagonal aluminum nitride (AlN) and gallium ni-
tride (GaN) monolayers [3,4] have reemerged as promising candidates,
drawing inspiration from the advent of graphene [5]. They share a
hexagonal lattice structure with graphene and offer distinct features
and exciting prospects for various optoelectronic applications [6]. One
of the critical distinctions lies in the semiconducting band gap prop-
erties displayed by AlN and GaN monolayers, making them highly
attractive for these applications [7]. Their wide band gap enables effi-
cient control of charge carriers, rendering them suitable for applications
such as transistors [8] and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [9]. On the
contrary, the zero bandgap of graphene limits its usage in devices
requiring distinct on/off switching behavior [10].
The electronic properties of AlN and GaN monolayers arise from
their unique atomic constituents, which include aluminum and gal-
lium atoms. These elements exhibit distinct energy levels and bonding
characteristics compared to carbon atoms found in graphene [7]. As

a result, AlN and GaN monolayers display diverse band gap ener-
gies and optical properties, giving rise to distinctive absorption and
emission spectra that differ from those of graphene [6,11]. Beyond
their electronic characteristics, AlN and GaN monolayers demonstrate
exceptional thermal stability and mechanical properties, making them
suitable for deployment in high-temperature environments and high-
performance devices [12,13]. Their robustness and durability make
them ideal for electronic applications that require resistance to extreme
conditions [14].
One prominent application of these materials lies in optoelectron-
ics, specifically in developing LEDs [15,16]. GaN-based LEDs have
significantly impacted the lighting industry by providing long-lasting
energy-efficient alternatives to conventional incandescent and fluores-
cent lighting sources [17]. Group-III nitrides, including AlN and GaN,
are also useful in laser diodes [18], power electronic devices [19,20],
and sensors [21]. The versatility and wide-ranging applications of AlN
and GaN monolayers highlight their significance in driving techno-
logical advances in various fields, particularly in optoelectronics and
solid-state lighting [19]. Ongoing research and development efforts

continue to explore novel materials synthesis techniques and device ar-
chitectures to unlock their full potential in the ever-evolving landscape
of advanced materials and electronic devices [22].
In recent in-silico studies, a series of 2D materials based on group-III
elements have emerged as promising candidates [23,24]. These mate-
rials share a comparable structure with certain carbon-based mono-
layers that have already been successfully synthesized [25‚Äì27]. One
notable example is the boron nitride form of the biphenylene network
(BPN) [27], known as BN-BPN [28‚Äì31], which has been proposed and
its stability confirmed in several numerical studies based on distinct
computational protocols. However, to fully comprehend the potential
of this specific lattice topology and explore its practical applications,
it is crucial to characterize other group-III counterparts of BPN. By
investigating these counterparts, we can expand our understanding of
their properties and identify potential applications for these materials.
Using computational approaches for material design has become
essential in research for several compelling reasons. Usually, theoretical
predictions of new nanostructured materials preceded their synthesis
by years or decades. Categorical examples are the BPN and the 2D
monolayer of C60, which had the first theoretical works published
by Mortazavi in 2017 [32], and Tomanek in 1990 [33], respectively.
Simulating and predicting material properties can be performed by
employing computational models, allowing virtual experiments and
expediting the discovery and development of new materials. Com-
putational techniques enable researchers to delve into the underly-
ing physics and chemistry of materials, providing insights into their
atomic-scale structures, electronic properties, and interactions. This
deep understanding helps to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms
that govern the behavior of materials and guides the design of materials
with tailored properties.
In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calcula-
tions to investigate the mechanical, electronic, thermodynamic, and
optical properties of two additional group-III counterparts of BPN:
gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). We gain
valuable insights into their electronic and structural features using our
computational approach. One crucial aspect that we focused on was
their structural stability. Interestingly, the BPN topology has proven
suitable for designing stable group-III nitride materials.
2. Methodology
The CASTEP [34] code was used to perform DFT simulations, in-
vestigating the mechanical, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical
properties of BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN (refer to Fig. 1). In these sim-
ulations, the exchange and correlation functions were treated using
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), parameterized by the
Perdew‚ÄìBurke‚ÄìErnzerhof (PBE) functional [35], as well as the Heyd‚Äì
Scuseria‚ÄìErnzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional [36]. To accurately ac-
count for the interactions between the nuclear electrons of each atomic
species, we employed norm-conserving pseudopotentials (as imple-
mented in CASTEP) designed explicitly for gallium, aluminum, and
nitrogen.
For achieving electronic self-consistency, we employed the Broy
den‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShannon (BFGS) unrestricted nonlinear itera-
tive algorithm [37,38]. The plane-wave basis set had an energy cutoff
of 700 eV, and we set the convergence criteria for the energy at 1.0
√ó10‚àí5 eV. To fully relax the BPN-(Ga, Al)N lattices, we used periodic
boundary conditions, ensuring that the residual force on each atom was
less than 1.0 √ó10‚àí3 eV/√Ö and the pressure was below 0.01 GPa. During
the lattice optimization, the basis vector along the ùëß-direction was held
fixed, and we employed a k-grid of 10 √ó 10 √ó 1, while for electronic
and optical calculations, we used a k-grid of 15 √ó 15 √ó 1 and 5 √ó 5 √ó 1
for the GGA/PBE and HSE06 methods, respectively. The partial density
of states (PDOS) was calculated at the HSE06 level using a k-grid of
20 √ó 20 √ó 1. The elastic properties were calculated using the LDA/CA-
PZ method [39,40]. A vacuum region of 20 √Ö was considered to avoid
spurious interactions among periodic images.

BPN-AlN. The unit cells are highlighted by rectangles defined by lattice vectors ùëéand
ùëè. Green, pink, and blue represent gallium, aluminum, and nitrogen atoms.
The decision to employ a smaller k-grid resolution in our HSE06
calculations, in contrast to the k-grid used in the GGA/PBE method, is
primarily driven by computational considerations, specifically the sub-
stantial computational cost associated with the HSE06 method. HSE06-
based calculations involve significant computational time, which can
limit the feasibility of employing a finer k-grid. We performed conver-
gence tests to validate the suitability of the selected k-grid resolution for
our HSE06 calculations. Our convergence tests verified that the chosen
k-grid resolution maintains the required accuracy and reliability of the
results within an acceptable margin of error.
For the phonon calculations, we utilized the linear response method
with a grid spacing of 0.05 1/√Ö and a convergence tolerance of
10‚àí5 eV/√Ö2. To assess the mechanical properties of the BPN-(Ga,Al)N
lattices, we employed the stress‚Äìstrain method based on the Voigt‚Äì
Reuss‚ÄìHill approximation [41,42]. This method follows Hooker‚Äôs law,
establishing a linear relationship between the Lagrangian strain and the
Cauchy stress tensor.
We applied an external electric field of 1.0 V/√Ö along the ùë•and
ùë¶directions to investigate the optical properties. Using the complex
dielectric constant ùúñ= ùúñ1 + ùëñùúñ2, where ùúñ1 and ùúñ2 represent the real
and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, respectively, we directly
obtained the optical quantities. To calculate the imaginary part of the
dielectric constant, we employed Fermi‚Äôs golden rule, which considers
interband optical transitions between the valence (VB) and conduction
bands (CB), where

In the context of optical properties, various parameters play a role.
These include the photon frequency (ùúî), the unit cell volume (ùëâùõ∫), the
k-point weight (ùëäùëò) in reciprocal space, and the dipole transition ma-
trix element (ùúåùëñùëó). The relationship between the real (ùúñ1) and imaginary
(ùúñ2) parts of the dielectric constant is established through the Kramers‚Äì
Kronig relation [43]. Specifically, the real part of the dielectric constant
can be expressed as:

Additional coefficients can be derived once the dielectric constant‚Äôs
real and imaginary parts are obtained to characterize the optical prop-
erties further. These coefficients include the absorption coefficient (ùõº),
the optical conductivity (ùúé), and the reflectivity (ùëÖ). Their calculation

To understand the thermal effect on the BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices, we
used CASTEP to calculate thermodynamic properties, enthalpy ùêª(ùëá),
free energy ùêπ(ùëá), entropy ùëÜ(ùëá), and temperature times the entropy

the heat capacity of the materials ùê∂ùëâ(ùëá) as a function of temperature.
The equations below are based on work by Baroni and coworkers [44].
The temperature dependence of the enthalpy ùêª(ùëá) is given by

3. Results
We first present the lattice arrangement of the optimized BPN-
(Ga,Al)N sheets, as depicted in Fig. 1. As expected, the GGA/PBE
and HSE06 methods yield comparable optimized parameters for these
lattices. Therefore, in this regard, we focus on the results obtained using
the HSE06 method, showcasing Fig. 1 and Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the
slight distortion of the four- and eight-membered rings in the BPN-
(Ga,Al)N lattices compared to the all-carbon BPN structure [31,45]
while maintaining a planar configuration. These lattices possess an
orthorhombic crystal structure and fall under the PMMA space group
(D2H-5). The ùëéand ùëèlattice vectors are 9.71 √Ö and 5.79 √Ö for BPN-GaN
and 9.61 √Ö and 5.62 √Ö for BPN-AlN.
To assess the dynamical stability of the BPN-(Ga,Al)N sheets, we
calculated their formation energies and the phonon dispersion relations
along the high symmetry directions using the GGA/PBE method, as
depicted in Fig. 2. We found formation energy values of ‚àí5.89 eV and
‚àí4.82 eV for BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN structures, respectively.

Phonon dispersion analysis of the unstrained BPN-GaN sheet (see
Fig. 2(a)) revealed the presence of imaginary frequencies, specifically
soft longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes [46,47]. Generally,
this trend indicates inherent instability. On the contrary, the phonon
dispersion diagram shown in Fig. 2(b) consists exclusively of real
frequencies, indicating the dynamic stability of the BPN-AlN sheets. The
absence of a band gap between the acoustic and optical modes suggests
a high scattering process rate and a short phonon lifetime, contributing
to this material‚Äôs relatively low lattice thermal conductivity.
The presence of imaginary frequencies in the BPN-GaN lattice in-
dicates its susceptibility to structural distortions, emphasizing the sig-
nificance of this observation. Such distortions may arise from inade-
quate bonding interactions within the material or even intrinsic stress.
These instabilities can have adverse consequences, including phonon
scattering, diminished thermal conductivity, and even structural defor-
mations. The subsequent AIMD results below provide information on
structural deformations of the BPN-GaN lattice.
One way to assess the thermal stability of a material using AIMD
simulations is by monitoring the total energy per atom throughout
the simulation. In a thermally stable system, the total energy per
atom should remain relatively constant, indicating a balanced energy
distribution within the material. Fluctuations in the total energy per
atom during the simulation can provide insights into the material‚Äôs
response to thermal perturbations.
To ensure the dynamical stabilities of BPN-(Ga,Al)N, we conducted
5 ps of AIMD simulations at 1000 K using the GGA/PBE approach,
as depicted in Fig. 3. The insets in the figure provide a top and side
view of the AIMD snapshot, showcasing the lattices in their final stages
during the simulations. A 3 √ó 3 √ó 1 supercell comprising 108 atoms was
used. This period and system size are usually employed to investigate
the system stability in AIMD simulations [48]. Observing both cases,
one can see that the total energy per atom exhibits a flat pattern. The
inset in Fig. 3(a) presents the MD snapshot (side view) of BPN-GaN
at 5 ps, revealing some lattice distortions imposed by the tempera-
ture. However, the top view illustrates that no bond reconstructions
occur concerning the optimized lattice in Fig. 1. Analogously, Fig. 3(b)
demonstrates that BPN-AlN maintains its planarity without any bond
reconstructions. These observations suggest that both structures exhibit
good thermal stability.
When the formation energy of a structure lies on the convex hull,
it is considered thermodynamically stable and experimentally viable.
Examining the formation energy plot versus ùëÅconcentrations (refer to
Fig. 4), we have identified a global minimum structure in this 2D space.
This minimum occurs precisely at the midpoint, with N:(Ga,Al) = 1:1
composition, resembling a structure closely akin to all-carbon BPN.
We now delve into the band structure characteristics of BPN-
(Ga,Al)N lattices. The upper panels of Fig. 5 present the band structure
profiles obtained using the GGA/PBE (black) and HSE06 (blue) meth-
ods. In the case of BPN-GaN (see Fig. 5(a)), the band gap is indirect
(from the X-point to the G-point) and measures 1.86 and 2.31 eV at the
levels of GGA/PBE and HSE06, respectively. For BPN-AlN, the indirect
band gap values from the X-point to the G-point are 2.32 eV and 3.18
eV according to the GGA/PBE and HSE06 calculations, respectively (see
Fig. 5(b)).
Generally, GGA/PBE calculations underestimate band gaps [49].
Therefore, the hybrid functional HSE06 was used to precisely obtain
the electronic and optical properties. The band structures of bothMaterials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials, as obtained from GGA/PBE, exhibit wide semi-
conducting band gaps, which are useful in optoelectronics and high-
power devices [50]. On the other hand, the HSE06 calculation sug-
gests that BPN-AlN behaves as an insulator. These band structures
are characterized by energy bands near the Fermi level that exhibit
dispersion, indicating the delocalized nature of electronic states within
these materials.
The difference in predicting the band gap values for BPN-AlN and
BPN-GaN arises from these computational methods‚Äô inherent limita-
tions and approximations. The HSE06 method, being a hybrid func-
tional, incorporates a fraction of exact exchange in addition to the
exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional. Including nonlocal exchange inter-
actions tends to yield more accurate electronic structure predictions,
especially for systems with significant electron localization or delocal-
ization, like semiconductors. As such, the band gap calculated using
HSE06 is often considered to provide a more reliable representation
of electronic properties. In contrast, the PBE method relies on the
generalized gradient approximation.
For BPN-AlN, the hole (ùëö‚àó
‚Ñé) and electron (ùëö‚àó
ùëí) effective masses
are 0.250ùëö0 and 0.085ùëö0, respectively. For BPN-GaN, ùëö‚àó
‚Ñéand ùëö‚àó
ùëíare
0.875ùëö0 and 0.038ùëö0, respectively. ùëö0 is the electron mass. Gener-
ally, a lower effective mass correlates with higher carrier mobility, as
carriers experience less resistance while moving in the crystal lattice.
These values suggest that BPN-AlN could be particularly suitable for
applications requiring efficient hole transport, such as p-type transistor
channels or hole-dominant charge transport layers in photodetectors
or solar cells. In contrast, BPN-GaN, with its higher hole effective mass
and lower electron effective mass, is anticipated to have higher electron
mobility, when contrasted with BPN-AlN, could be advantageous for
applications that prioritize electron transport, such as n-type transistor
channels or electron-dominant charge transport layers in optoelec-
tronic devices. Remarkably, the ùëö‚àó
ùëívalues of BPN-(Al,Ga)N are lower
than those for the typical wz-AlN and wz-GaN structures (0.22ùëö0 and
0.25ùëö0 [51], respectively). This feature reinforces that BPN-(Al,Ga)N
systems hold greater promise for applications demanding enhanced
electronic transport efficiency than their wurtzite analogs.
We determined the full valence-band (VB) and conduction-band
(CB) bandwidths for BPN(Al,Ga)N systems. The VB and CB values for
BPN-GaN are 17.76 eV and 25.70 eV, respectively. The VB and CB
values for BPN-AlN are 16.29 eV and 21.94 eV, respectively. The band-
width establishes a range of energy values over which electrons can
exist within a particular band. It also captures the extent of energy val-
ues within which electrons can occupy states, thereby influencing theirMaterials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

kinetic behavior and mobility. A wider energy bandwidth typically
corresponds to a broader range of electron energies, which can impact
various electronic phenomena, including conductivity, carrier mobility,
and optical transitions. For instance, the VB values for common AlN and
GaN monolayers are about 15.80 eV [52].
The partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of BPN-GaN and BPN-
AlN, using the HSE06 hybrid functional, is shown in the left and right
bottom panels of Fig. 5, respectively. As a general trend, results indicate
a significant predominance of p-states for both materials. In these
cases, electronic transitions and interactions will primarily involve the
participation of p-orbitals. These orbitals are typically associated with
directional bonding. They are characterized by lobes with a dumbbell-
like shape, enabling them to interact with neighboring atoms or orbitals
in a controlled manner.
Figs. 5(b,e) provide a comprehensive view of the total contributions
of s, p, d, and f orbitals for both atomic species within each lattice.
Figs. 5(c,f) illustrate the PDOS per atomic species. The p-states play
a dominant role. In the case of BPN-GaN, Ga-p orbitals contribute
significantly, followed closely by N-p states. Additionally, Ga-s orbitals
primarily participate in forming the conduction band. For BPN-AlN, N-
p orbitals have a higher contribution, with Al-p states following suit.
Similarly, Al-s orbitals play a crucial role in shaping the conduction
band.
With regard to p-state properties, the behavior of p-states in a
material has crucial implications for its electronic, optical, and trans-
port properties. A material‚Äôs p-states can influence phenomena such
as energy band gaps, absorption and emission of light, and charge
mobility. For instance, the nature of p-states can determine the type
of electronic transitions that occur, affecting the material‚Äôs optical
characteristics. Materials with well-defined p-states often exhibit in-
teresting optoelectronic properties, making them suitable candidates
for applications like photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and sensors.Materials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

Furthermore, the interaction of p-states with neighboring atoms or
external fields can influence charge transport mechanisms, affecting the
material‚Äôs performance in electronic devices.
Materials with well-defined p-states often exhibit interesting op-
toelectronic properties, making them suitable candidates for photo-
voltaics, light-emitting diodes, and sensors. Furthermore, the interac-
tion of p-states with neighboring atoms or external fields can influence
charge transport mechanisms, affecting the material‚Äôs performance in
electronic devices.
Here, it is worth comparing the BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN band
structures with conventional AlN and GaN having wurtzite (wz) and
zincblende (zb) structures [53]. Table 2 presents the theoretical band
gap (ùê∏ùëî) using the HSE06+G0W0 approach and corresponding exper-
imental (Exp) band gaps for (wz, zb)-GaN and (wz, zb)-AlN structures
reported in the literature [54]. Notably, the BNP-AlN band gap sig-
nificantly differs from those observed in (wz, zb)-AlN. While BPN-AlN
acts as a wide-bandgap semiconductor (wz, zb)-AlN is an insulator.
The band structure characteristics of BPN-AlN discussed above make it
particularly suitable for emerging optoelectronic applications, such as
high-frequency switching devices [55], light-emitting diodes [56], and
RF power amplifiers [57]. BPN-GaN displays similar band gap values
to those reported for (wz, zb)-GaN. These materials also fall within
the wide-bandgap semiconductors category, demonstrating interesting
potential for the aforementioned applications.
Fig. 6 presents the optical properties of the BPN-(Ga, Al)N lattices,
focusing on the polarization of light along the ùë•(E//X), ùë¶(E//Y),
and z (E//Z) directions. Calculations were performed using the HSE06
method. The solid and dashed lines correspond to the BPN-GaN and
BPN-AlN systems. In Fig. 6(a), the optical absorption (ùõº) is shown as
a function of the photon energy. Both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials exhibit
strong optical activity, primarily in the ultraviolet (UV) region.
The refractive index (ùëÖ) in Fig. 6(b) shows a prominent peak at
approximately 6.0 eV for E//(X,Y) and 5.2 eV for E//Z in the case
of BPN-GaN, while BPN-AlN shows peaks around 6.4 eV for E//(X,Y)
and 5.5 eV for E//Z. The absorption coefficient gradually increases
from zero and exhibits pronounced peaks at approximately 6.0 eV for
E//(X,Z) and 6.2 eV for E//(Y) in the case of BPN-GaN, while BPN-AlN
shows a peak at around 6.5 eV for E//(X,Y,Z). These findings suggest
that BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials will likely be transparent in a solution and
hold promise as potential candidates for UV device collectors.
In Fig. 6(c), the real part (Re) of the optical conductivity is shown
for BPN-GaN (solid black line) and BPN-AlN (solid blue line) over a
photon energy range of 0.0 to 7.0 eV. Both materials exhibit distinct
peaks in their curves, with a BPN-GaN peak at 5.8 eV and a BPN-
AlN peak at 6.1 eV. The gradual increase in the real part of optical
conductivity up to 5.8 eV corresponds to the increasing absorption
coefficient within this energy range. These peaks indicate regions where
electromagnetic waves can penetrate profoundly and reflect high opti-
cal conductivity. Therefore, targeting these specific peak energy values
would be beneficial in optimizing BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices for high optical
conductivity.
In this figure, the imaginary part (Im) of the optical conductivity is
displayed for BPN-GaN (dashed black line) and BPN-AlN (dashed blue
line) over a photon energy range of 0.0 to 7.0 eV. Both materials exhibit
peaks in their respective curves, with a BPN-GaN peak at 5.0 eV and a
BPN-AlN peak at 4.7 eV. The negative values of the imaginary part of
optical conductivity indicate an increase in the extinction coefficient,
which suggests a reduction in the conductivity of the BPN-(Ga,Al)N
lattices within this energy range. Consequently, the propagation of
electromagnetic waves within this range is also diminished.
Fig. 6(d) illustrates the real and imaginary parts of the complex
dielectric function for BPN-(GaN,AlN) as a function of energy. In the
energy range of 4.0‚Äì5.0 eV, both lattices exhibit peaks in their real
parts, which can be attributed to the electronic polarizability of these
materials. On the contrary, the imaginary part shows peaks at 6.0 eV,
indicating electronic transitions involving the (Ga,Al)-p character of the
conduction states, as revealed by the PDOS analysis in Fig. 5. Beyond
the band gap energy, the dielectric function shows a significant increase
in its imaginary part, highlighting the strong UV absorption capabilities
of the materials.
To gain insights into the thermal behavior of BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices,
we conducted calculations to determine their thermodynamic proper-
ties, including entropy ùëÜ(ùëá), enthalpy ùêª(ùëá), and free energy ùêπ(ùëá). We
investigate the temperature dependence of the entropy term, expressed
as ùëÜ(ùëá) = ùëà‚àíùêπ, where ùëàrepresents the system‚Äôs internal energy.
Moreover, we evaluated the heat capacity ùê∂ùëâ(ùëá) of the materials as
a function of temperature. Fig. 7 displays these calculated thermody-
namic properties, which were obtained using the GGA/PBE level of
theory.
Entropy measures the degree of disorder within a physical system‚Äôs
atomic arrangements. Fig. 7 illustrates the temperature-dependent be-
havior of ùëá*ùëÜ(ùëá) in BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices. At extremely low tempera-
tures (below 100 K), the entropy value tends to zero, indicating a highly
organized lattice structure with restricted atomic mobility. However,
as the temperature rises, these monolayers exhibit increased thermal
mobility, leading to a corresponding increase in the constituent parti-
cles‚Äô internal energy (ùëà), including their kinetic energy. Consequently,
the spacing between adjacent atoms (bond distances) expands, resulting
in the crystals‚Äô thermal expansion. This increased particle instability
correlates with an increase in entropy as the temperature continues to
rise (as observed in the black curves of Fig. 7(a)).
Fig. 7(a) also presents the temperature dependence of ùêª(ùëá) for the
BPN-(Ga, Al) ùëÅmonolayers. At low temperatures (below 100 K), ùêª(ùëá)
remains constant, indicating a stable state for both materials. However,
a quadratic relationship between ùêªand ùëáis observed as the tempera-
ture exceeds this critical value. Lower values of ùêª(ùëá) indicate a more
favorable formation process, suggesting the thermodynamic stability of
the lattice. This feature is consistent with the observation that higher
temperatures result in higher ùêª(ùëá), reducing the probability of finding
an energetically stable structure, as depicted in Fig. 7(a). Notably, both
materials exhibit ùêª(ùëá) values below 6 eV for temperatures up to 1000
K.
It is essential to note the close relationship between ùêª(ùëá) and ùëà
in crystals. The internal energy (ùëà) of the system is the sum of ùêª(ùëá)
and the product of pressure (ùëÉ) and volume (ùëâ). As the temperature
increases, the internal energy also increases. Consequently, the crystal
undergoes thermal expansion, increasing volume (ùëâ) and pressure and
volume product (ùëÉ√óùëâ). This trend, in turn, contributes to the elevation
of ùêª(ùëá) in BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers.
At low temperatures, lattices absorb thermal energy similarly to har-
monic oscillators. However, as the energy reaches a certain threshold,
lattice anharmonicity comes into play, resulting in a linear relationship.
This behavior is observed in both systems, where the enthalpy increases
with rising temperature, although the degree of dependence may vary.
The system‚Äôs internal energy (ùëà- ùëá*ùëÜ) is considered to understand this
dependence further. Notably, the rate of increase in ùëá*ùëÜsurpasses that
of the internal energy ùëà. Fig. 7(a) depicts the temperature dependence
of ùêπ(ùëá). The lattices maintain their structural integrity at low tempera-
tures without inducing anharmonicity or energy losses upon receiving
additional energy. However, at high temperatures, lattice scattering
becomes prominent, introducing anharmonicity into the system.Materials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

Fig. 7. Thermodynamic potentials of BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices. In panel (a), the red curves show the structure formation enthalpy ùêª(ùëá), the blue curves represent the free energy
ùêπ(ùëá), and the black curves illustrate the temperature times the entropy term (ùëá*ùëÜ(ùëá)). In panel (b), the heat capacity as a function of the temperature (ùê∂ùëâ(ùëá)) is shown in black
and red for BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN.
Heat capacity plays a vital role in assessing a material‚Äôs thermal
characteristics as it measures the energy absorption when the temper-
ature increases by one Kelvin. In Fig. 7(b), the temperature-dependent
behavior of the heat capacity in the BPN-(Ga, Al) ùëÅmonolayers is
depicted, revealing similarities between the two materials. BPN-AlN
exhibits a slightly higher heat capacity, suggesting a greater production
of phonons at a given temperature than that of BPN-GaN. As the
temperature rises, the intrinsic monolayer heat capacity also increases
due to the greater involvement of phonons. This trend aligns with
the structural dependency observed in time-dependent enthalpy (see
Fig. 7(a)).
In the temperature range of 0 to 300 K, the heat capacity ex-
periences a steep increase with temperature, as shown in Fig. 7(b).
However, between 300 and 1000 K, the growth rate slows down.
The heat capacity reaches a maximum limit at temperatures beyond
the Debye characteristic temperature (approximately 900 K for both
materials), where all vibrations contain the same energy. This behavior
follows the Dulong‚ÄìPetit law, indicating that the specific heat capacity
of the high-temperature lattice remains constant and independent of
the temperature.
The temperature-dependent behavior of entropy and enthalpy sheds
light on the stability and phase transitions of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolay-
ers. Constant enthalpy at low temperatures indicates a stable state,
while the quadratic relationship observed as temperatures rise indi-
cates thermodynamic stability. These findings have implications for
the design of devices with enhanced thermal stability and controlled
phase transitions. In this sense, BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could serve
as building blocks for smart materials capable of responding to specific
temperature ranges and finding applications in thermal actuators or
switches. The expansion of crystals‚Äô bond distances and the correlation
between internal energy and enthalpy contribute to understanding
thermal expansion mechanisms. These insights are crucial for devel-
oping nanoscale devices where precise control of thermal expansion is
essential.Materials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

BPN-(Ga,Al)N structures could be integrated into nanoelectrome-
chanical systems that require controlled thermal expansion for optimal
performance. The temperature-dependent behavior of the heat capacity
offers insights into energy absorption as temperature increases. Under-
standing heat capacity can guide the design of materials for efficient
energy harvesting and conversion. BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could be
employed in thermoelectric generators, converting waste heat into us-
able electrical energy. The similarities and differences in heat capacity
between BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN suggest distinct phonon behaviors
that affect thermal conductivity. This insight is valuable for develop-
ing materials with tailored thermal transport properties. BPN-(Ga,Al)N
monolayers could be engineered to enhance or minimize thermal con-
ductivity, making them suitable for applications ranging from efficient
thermal insulators to high-performance thermal conductors.
We now analyze the elastic properties of BPN-(Ga,Al)N, which play
a crucial role in understanding microcracks behavior and materials‚Äô
overall durability. To assess the anisotropy in their mechanical prop-
erties, we determine the Poisson‚Äôs ratio (ùúà(ùúÉ)) and Young‚Äôs modulus
(ùëå(ùúÉ)) under pressure in the xy plane, as given by the following

where, ùõº= cos(ùúÉ) and ùõΩ= sin(ùúÉ). The elastic constants of BPN-(Ga,Al)N
are shown in Table 3. Furthermore, Fig. 8 provides a 2D visualization
of the Poisson‚Äôs ratio (Fig. 8(a)) and Young‚Äôs modulus (Fig. 8(b)) in the
xy plane for BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers.
The elastic constants C11, C22, C12, and C44 obtained for the BPN-
(Ga,Al)N monolayers, presented in Table 3, satisfy the Born‚ÄìHuang
criteria of the orthorhombic crystal (ùê∂11ùê∂22 ‚àíùê∂2
12 > 0 and ùê∂44 >
0) [60,61], indicating their good mechanical stability. Additionally,
Young‚Äôs modulus and Poisson‚Äôs ratio of BPN-(Ga,Al)N structures were
calculated using Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively (see Fig. 8). We found
these properties exhibit anisotropic characteristics.
Regarding Young‚Äôs modulus, the calculated maximum values
(ùëåùëÄùê¥ùëã) are 158.39 GPa and 114.50 GPa for BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN, re-
spectively. These values are smaller than those of hexagonal AlN (405.1
GPa [62]) and GaN (287.7 GPa [63]) monolayers. These differences
can be attributed to the porosity of the BPN-like structures, resulting
from the presence of eight-atom rings and the rigidity of the bonds in
the four-atom rings. These factors contribute to the reduced resilience
of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers to strain compared to their hexagonal
counterparts [64].
When a compressive (tensile) strain is acted in one direction, ma-
terials tend to expand (contract) in the perpendicular direction, cor-
responding to the positive Poisson‚Äôs ratio for ordinary materials. The
opposite is for materials with a negative Poisson‚Äôs ratio (i.e. auxetic
materials [65]). In Fig. 8, one can note that BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN
have positive Poisson‚Äôs ratio, with maximum values (ùúàùëÄùê¥ùëã) about 0.91
and 0.82, respectively. For these ùúàùëÄùê¥ùëãvalues, Young‚Äôs modulus values
are less than 20 GPa, indicating the incompressibility of these materials
for biaxial strains, i.e., strains that are not applied solely along the ùë•or
ùë¶directions (uniaxial strains).
Most common materials exhibit Poisson‚Äôs ratios ranging from 0.2
to 0.5 [66]. A Poisson‚Äôs ratio of 0.5 indicates incompressible materials
that retain their lateral dimensions when subjected to axial strain. For
BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN, the minimum values of their Poisson‚Äôs ratios
(ùúàùëÄùêºùëÅ) for uniaxial strains applied along the ùë•and ùë¶directions are 0.20
and 0.11, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those
observed in hexagonal AlN and GaN, which are approximately 0.46
and 0.44 [67], respectively. The lower Poisson ratios of BPN-AlN and
BPN-GaN can be attributed to their BPN-like structures, which possess
a degree of porosity higher than those of their honeycomb-based lattice
counterparts. This increased porosity allows BPN structures to undergo
more deformation under tension, resulting in lower Poisson ratios.
Notably, BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN exhibit distinctive mechanical re-
sponses due to their unique BPN-like structures. Young‚Äôs modulus
values of 158.39 GPa and 114.50 GPa for BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN are
lower than those for their hexagonal counterparts [68,69]. This devi-
ation is attributed to the porosity inherent in the BPN-like structures,
which results from the presence of eight-atom rings and the rigidity
of bonds in the four-atom rings. Consequently, these structural fea-
tures influence the mechanical resilience of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers,
rendering them less resistant to strain than hexagonal AlN and GaN
monolayers.
The anisotropic mechanical behavior, reflected in Young‚Äôs modu-
lus, makes BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN promising candidates for flexible
electronics and nanomechanical devices. Their relatively lower Young‚Äôs
modulus than hexagonal counterparts suggests improved deformability
and resilience to bending or mechanical stress. This attribute is cru-
cial in applications such as wearable electronics, sensors, and flexible
displays, where mechanical adaptability is a key consideration.
The Poisson‚Äôs ratio of BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN offers an intriguing
avenue for microelectromechanical systems applications. The positive
Poisson‚Äôs ratio indicates responsiveness to strain variations, while the
lower values compared to hexagonal materials hint at unique de-
formability. These attributes can be leveraged to design MEMS de-
vices with tailored actuation and sensing capabilities. Moreover, the
distinctive mechanical properties of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could
contribute to energy harvesting applications. Their good deformability
under mechanical stress can be interesting for piezoelectric energy
conversion.
Based on the results presented here, the advantages of BPN-(Al,Ga)N
materials over common GaN and AlN with wurtzite and zincblende
structures are twofold: I. Novel electronic properties: BPN-based mate-
rials exhibit a unique atomic arrangement that can lead to innovative
electronic properties, holding promise for electronic and optoelectronic
devices; II. Porous structure and surface area: The BPN topology boasts a
substantial surface area-to-volume ratio and a porous composition, ren-
dering it suitable for various surface-dependent applications, including
gas capture, sensing, and adsorption [70‚Äì72].
We must acknowledge two primary disadvantages of BPN-(Al,Ga)N
materials compared to conventional GaN and AlN structures: I. Synthesis
and stabilization challenges: The synthesis and stabilization of BPN pose
challenges due to its intricate structure and potential reactivity; II.
Ongoing research and exploration: BPN remains a relatively new material,
with its properties and potential applications still actively researched.

properties remain unexplored in BPN-based materials. Moreover, wz-
GaN finds extensive utility in LEDs [73], laser diodes [74], and other
optoelectronic devices owing to its direct band gap and high electron
mobility. The zincblende structure facilitates the creation of quantum
dots, holding promise for applications in quantum computing and
advanced optical devices. Nonetheless, challenges in crystal growth
persist, impacting the achievement of high-quality single crystals and
subsequently affecting device performance. The synthesis and control
of zincblende structures also present challenges, influencing device
integration and overall performance.
Most of the notable properties of these materials derive from their
band gap configurations. With band gap values of 2.30 eV for BPN-
AlN and 3.18 eV for BPN-GaN, these materials offer a tunable range
of band gaps, enabling tailored electronic and optical functionalities.
The variation in band gaps allows for design flexibility in different de-
vices and applications. Moreover, BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN exhibit wide
band gaps, making them suitable for high-power and high-temperature
environments.
In contrast with conventional AlN structures, the comparatively
lower band gap of BPN-AlN could make it suitable for developing high-
efficiency light-emitting diodes, particularly in the UV‚Äìvisible spectral
range. The wider BPN-GaN band gap lends itself to optoelectronic
devices operating at higher photon energies. BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN,
with their wide band gap and potential for efficient electron mobility,
hold promise for high-frequency switching applications, such as RF
power amplifiers and high-speed transistors.
Leveraging their unique electronic properties, BPN-AlN and BPN-
GaN can find utility in sensor technologies, including gas sensing,
biosensing, and radiation detection, where their porous lattice structureMaterials Today Communications 37 (2023) 107183

and tailored band gaps could enhance sensitivity and selectivity. The
tunable band gaps of these materials suggest applications in photo-
voltaic devices, where they could facilitate efficient light absorption
and electron‚Äìhole separation.
To understand the electronic conductance in monolayer BPN-
(Ga,Al)N, we have extended our analysis to calculate the mobility of
the charge carrier using the deformation potential (DP) theory [75].
This approach is based on the effective mass approximation and is
commonly employed for evaluating carrier mobility in 2D layered
semiconductors. Carrier mobility (ùúá) is defined as

(VBM for the holes and CBM for electrons). VBM and CBM are the
maximum valence and minimum conduction bands at G and X points.
ùëòùêµ, ùëá, ùëí, and ‚Ñè, correspond to Boltzmann‚Äôs constant, temperature, the
elementary charge of an electron, and Planck‚Äôs constant.

sile strains, we calculate ùê∏1 by linear fitting of the CBM and VBM values
for electrons and holes, respectively (see Fig. 9(a)). Subsequently, ùê∂2ùê∑
is determined by applying a quadratic fitting approach to total energy
data as a function of compressive and tensile strains, as depicted in
Fig. 9(b).
The electron mobility surpasses the hole mobility, as indicated in
Table 4. Furthermore, the carrier mobility in the BPN-(Ga,Al)N mono-
layer exhibits anisotropic behavior, with notable distinctions between
the ùë•and ùë¶directions. Specifically, the carrier‚Äôs mobility along the ùë•
direction is considerably higher than in the ùë¶direction. This discrep-
ancy is primarily attributed to the significantly smaller effective mass
in the ùë•direction than in the ùë¶direction.
For example, in the h-AlN lattices, the electron mobility is 0.32
and 0.295 (in units of 103 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1) in the ùë•and ùë¶directions,
respectively [76]. On the contrary, the hole mobility measures 1.77 and
1.8 (in units of 103 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1) in these directions [76]. Notably, both
electrons and holes in BPN-AlN exhibit higher mobility than h-AlN.
Similarly, in the h-GaN monolayers, the electron mobility is 0.29 and
0.30 (in units of 103 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1) in the ùë•and ùë¶directions, respectively,
while the hole mobility is 1.74 and 2.39 (in units of 103 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1)
in the respective directions [76]. In BPN-GaN, both electrons and holes
exhibit enhanced mobility compared to that of h-GaN. The superior
charge carrier mobility observed in the BPN-(Ga,Al)N systems com-
pared with that observed in the h-(Ga,Al)N systems can be attributed
to their distinct topologies.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we performed DFT calculations to study the mechani-
cal, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of two group-III
counterparts of the recently synthesized biphenylene network (BPN):
gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). We cal-
culated formation energies and phonon dispersion relations along the
high-symmetry directions to assess their dynamical stabilities. More-
over, AIMD simulations were performed to describe their dynamical
stability at 1000 K.
The phonon dispersion profile of the BPN-GaN sheet revealed the
presence of imaginary frequencies. On the contrary, the phonon dis-
persion diagram of the BPN-AlN monolayer exclusively consists of real
frequencies, indicating its dynamic stability. The final AIMD snapshot
of BPN-(Al,Ga)N revealed lattice distortions. However, no bond re-
constructions occur regarding the initially optimized lattices. These
observations suggest that both structures exhibit good thermal stability.
In the case of BPN-GaN, the band gap is indirect and measures
2.31 eV and 1.86 eV at the HSE06 and GGA/PBE levels, respectively.
For BPN-AlN, the indirect bandgap values are 2.32 eV and 3.18 eV,
according to the GGA/PBE and HSE06 calculations, respectively. The
band structures of both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials exhibit wide semi-
conducting band gaps, which find applications in optoelectronics and
high-power devices. On the other hand, the HSE06 calculation suggests
that BPN-AlN behaves as an insulator. The optical properties analysis
demonstrated strong optical activity in the ultraviolet region for both
BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials, making them potential candidates for UV
device collectors.
