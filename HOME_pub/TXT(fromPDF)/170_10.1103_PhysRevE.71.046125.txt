A thermodynamic approach to rapid phase transformations within a diffuse interface in a binary system is
developed. Assuming an extended set of independent thermodynamic variables formed by the union of the
classic set of slow variables and the space of fast variables, we introduce ﬁniteness of the heat and solute
diffusive propagation at the ﬁnite speed of the interface advancing. To describe transformations within the
diffuse interface, we use the phase-ﬁeld model which allows us to follow steep but smooth changes of phase
within the width of the diffuse interface. Governing equations of the phase-ﬁeld model are derived for the
hyperbolic model, a model with memory, and a model of nonlinear evolution of transformation within the
diffuse interface. The consistency of the model is proved by the veriﬁcation of the validity of the condition of
positive entropy production and by outcomes of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. A comparison with exist-
ing sharp-interface and diffuse-interface versions of the model is given.

I. INTRODUCTION
A classic free-boundary problem introduces, within the
context of phase transformations theory, the model of phase
interface with a zero thickness. Within the scope of this prob-
lem, a sharp discontinuity in the properties sor a jump of
ﬂuxes and thermodynamic functionsd occurs across the inter-
face. The sharp-interface model has been successfully used
to describe many physical phenomena in various systems f1g.
However, the sharp-interface model has difﬁculties in de-
scribing situations when the interfacial thickness becomes
comparable with the characteristic length of the considered
phenomenon and when a topology of the interface becomes
complicated or multiply connected. To surmount these difﬁ-
culties, an alternative model with a ﬁnite interfacial thickness
was suggested for explaining phase transformations f2g.
Historically, the ﬁrst formulation of basic principles of
diffuse interfaces was given by Poisson, Maxwell, and Gibbs
f3g who suggested an interface be considered a region with a
ﬁnite thickness in which a steep but smooth transition of
physical properties of phases occurs. Lord Rayleigh, van der
Waals, and Korteweg f4g applied thermodynamical prin-
ciples to develop the gradient theories for interfaces with a
nonzero thickness. Through the past century, these ideas of
diffuse interface were reﬁned and applied in many physical
phenomena ssee, e.g., overviews in Ref. f5gd.
Diffuse-interface formalism has been widely applied to
phase transformations in condensed media. The ﬁrst intro-
duction of the diffuse interface into the theory of phase trans-
formations was made by Landau and Khalatnikov f6g by
borrowing a formalism of the Landau theory of phase tran-
sitions f7g. Landau and Khalatnikov labeled different phases
by an additional order parameter to describe anomalous
sound absorption of liquid helium. In its well-known form, a
formal variational approach was established by Ginzburg and
Landau for the phase transitions from the normal to the su-
perconducting phase f8g. On the basis of this approach,
diffuse-interface models with order parameters have been de-
veloped by Halperin, Hohenberg, and Ma f9g. They apply
these models to the theory of critical phenomena. In addition,
Allen and Cahn apply the same models to antiphase domain
coarsening f10g.
A diffuse-interface model has also been developed for a
description of phase transformations of the ﬁrst order, espe-
cially for the solidiﬁcation phenomenon. The diffuse-
interface model of solidiﬁcation incorporates an order pa-
rameter in the form of a phase-ﬁeld variable f11g. The phase-
ﬁeld F has a constant value in homogeneous phases, e.g.,
F=−1 for an unstable liquid phase. This phase is trans-
formed into the solid phase with F= +1. Between these
phases in the interfacial region, the phase ﬁeld F changes
steeply but smoothly from −1 to +1. Numerical solutions
allow one to avoid explicit tracking of the interface and to
locate the interface at F=0 f12g. As a particular case, the
phase-ﬁeld model is reduced to sharp interface limits f13g
and is consistent with major models of sharp interface ssuch
as Hele-Shaw type models, classical or modiﬁed Stefan
problem, etc.d. The phase ﬁeld F is considered as an order
parameter which is introduced to describe a moving interfa-
cial boundary between an initially unstable phase and the
ﬁnal phase.
Several thermodynamically consistent phase-ﬁeld models
have been proposed f14–17g. These include the models for a
transformation in a pure system f14g as well as rather general
models of multiphase transformations in multicomponent
systems f17g. All of these models assume local equilibrium
in a system, consistent with the basic hypothesis of classic
irreversible thermodynamics sCITsd f18,19g. This assumption
leads to an examination of a number of transport processes
with small and moderate deviations from thermodynamic

of the interface can be predicted. In principle, such an ap-
proach can be extended to a case characterized with a local
violation of the condition of equilibrium at the interface,
such as for solute trapping and kinetic effects f20g. However,
local equilibrium is missing both at the interface and within
bulk phases for cases of rapid transformation, such as rapid
solidiﬁcation f21g. In this case, the description of rapid phase
transformations can be provided by a formalism of extended
irreversible thermodynamics sEITsd f22g. This formalism
gives a causal description of transport processes and aban-
dons the assumption of local equilibrium. An extension of
the phase-ﬁeld methodology for a rapid transformation,
which is caused by a signiﬁcant deviation from a thermody-
namic equilibrium, has been made recently f23g.
The main purpose of the present paper is to describe a
thermodynamically consistent model of rapid phase transfor-
mation in a binary system under local nonequilibrium condi-
tions. Using the phase-ﬁeld methodology, we derive govern-
ing equations compatible with the macroscopic formalism of
EIT and the microscopic ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, a thermody-
namic description of the considered system is given. We in-
troduce dissipative diffusion ﬂuxes for heat and mass trans-
port together with the phase-ﬁeld rate of change, both as
independent variables. In Sec. III, the generalized Gibbs
equation and an entropy balance applicable to a rapid ad-
vancing of diffuse interfaces are given. As a starting point for
the present phase-ﬁeld model, an entropy functional is used
in Sec. IV. The analysis of the present phase-ﬁeld model
leads to governing equations for a hyperbolic system with
dissipation. In Sec. V, a generalization of the hyperbolic
phase-ﬁeld model is given using ﬂux relaxation functions, as
well as a variational principle. In Sec. VI, model equations
are compared with the outcomes of existing sharp-interface
and diffuse-interface models. Finally, in Sec. VII we present
a summary of our conclusions.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
A. Thermodynamic variables
Let us consider an isobaric binary system at a nonuniform
temperature T with no convective ﬂow and with given con-
centrations of atoms A and B. The local equilibrium hypoth-
esis establishes that local and instantaneous correlations
among properties of the system are the same as for the whole
system at a global equilibrium. Describing the nonequilib-
rium system as an ensemble of small local volumes in an
internal equilibrium, CIT is applicable to processes not too
far from the equilibrium f19g. In addition to CIT, a local
nonequilibrium formalism applicable to strongly nonequilib-
rium systems has been developed in past two decades
f22,24–26g. As a phenomenological theory, this formalism is
well-known as extended irreversible thermodynamics, EIT
f22,27g. This formalism goes beyond the hypothesis of local
equilibrium and avoids the paradox of a propagation of dis-
turbances with an inﬁnite speed.
A fundamental problem in attempting to describe systems
out of equilibrium is to select relevant variables needed for a
valid description of a nonequilibrium state. This problem has
been discussed extensively in the literature ssee references in
the bibliographic overview f28gd. A selection of the basic
state space with the inclusion of dissipative ﬂuxes is formu-
lated in EIT f24g and tested against experimental data f29g.
Accordingly, we extend the classic set of independent ther-
modynamic variables by the inclusion of dissipative ﬂuxes as
additional basic variables.
CIT is based on the local equilibrium hypothesis f18,19g
which assumes an instant relaxation of ﬂuxes to their steady-
state values and describes the ensemble of atoms within local
volumes by the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. In the standard
formalism of the diffuse-interface using CIT, the set hCj of
independent variables is assumed to consist of conserved
variables, such as energy density esrW,td and concentration
XsrW,td=XB/sXA+XBd of the B component in the system, and
the nonconserved phase-ﬁeld FsrW,td variable swhere t is the
time and rW is the position vector of a point within systemd.
This can be expressed formally as hCj=he,X,Fj.
The extended space of the independent variables E is
formed by the union of the classical set hCj and the addi-
tional space hFj of the ﬂuxes of heat qW and solute JW, and also
the rate of change ]F/]t of the phase-ﬁeld variable, i.e.,
hFj=hqW ,JW,]F/]tj. This yields
E = hCj ø hFj = he,X,Fj ø hqW,JW,]F/]tj.
s1d
Here hFj is the space of the fast non conserved thermody-
namic variables.
There are, in fact, different possible choices of variables
sﬂuxes in EIT, microstructural details in theories with inter-
nal variablesd, and the speciﬁc choice to be adopted depends
on the aims of the description and on the problems to be
analyzed. This does not mean that different choices of vari-
ables are incompatible. For instance, in the study of ﬂowing
polymer solutions one may select as independent variables
either the viscous pressure tensor or the conformation tensor
describing the average microstructure of macromolecules of
the system: a Legendre transform exists. This allows one to
pass from one description to the other: similar to the way it is
possible to pass from a description using internal energy as
independent variable to a description using absolute tempera-
ture as an independent variable in equilibrium thermodynam-
ics f30g.
Thus, our choice of ﬂuxes as variables does not exclude
other possibilities. To justify our choice, the meaning and
relevance of qW, JW, and ]F/]t as variables should be recon-
sidered on qualitative grounds. Fluxes qW and JW describe ex-
changes of heat and matter between an interface and the
neighboring bulk phases. The ﬂuxes do not follow instanta-
neously classical Fourier and Fick laws. It takes them some
time susually rather shortd to reach the value predicted by the
classical transport equations. Obviously, when the interface
motion is fast enough, delay effects in the dynamics of ﬂuxes
may play a determining role. This happens, for instance,
when the velocity V of the interface becomes comparable or
higher than l/t sl being the mean-free path of the particles
and t the relaxation time of ﬂuxesd. Thus, in these circum-

046125-2stances, qW and JW behave as independent variables with their
own dynamics, which has important consequences for the
dynamics and stability of the interface f31,32g.
The introduction of ]F/]t as an additional independent
variable is motivated by a similar, though slightly different
consideration. Indeed, the space variation of F is related,
among other factors, to the width of the interface. Thus, in-
cluding ]F/]t as an independent variable allows for a more
detailed description of both internal kinetics and shape of the
interface. In the same way as in Newtonian mechanics
swhere the initial position and velocity of a particle must be
speciﬁed to determine their evolutiond, here we take both F
and ]F/]t as independent variables. If inertial effects are
sufﬁciently low in comparison with dissipative effects,
]F/]t will be determined directly by a dynamical equation
in terms of F and its gradient. Otherwise, F and ]F/]t will
be independent and an equation for ]2F/]t2 must be found.
The above discussed choice of variables leads to two sets
of independent variables as follows. Variables from the set
hCj are characterized as the slow variables. Their behavior is
governed by conservation laws for energy and solute concen-
tration plus an evolution of the phase ﬁeld. They decay
slowly in time. In contrast, the independent space hFj con-
sists of nonconserved variables with a relatively high rate of
decay. The variables from hFj differ from their classical val-
ues during the time intervals of the order of magnitude of
characteristic times ti for the relaxation of the heat ﬂux, sol-
ute diffusion ﬂux, and rate of change of the phase-ﬁeld vari-
able, respectively. For time intervals much longer than the
relaxation times ti, the rate of variation of the ﬂuxes can be
ignored.
B. Relaxation times
Generally, relaxation times ti represent physically reason-
able time estimations for a spontaneous return of a system to
the steady state after a sudden perturbation. Relaxation times
tT and tD for the heat and solute, respectively, can be con-
sidered as times needed for smoothing of inhomogeneities of
temperature and concentration, respectively, by diffusion.
The time tF of the relaxation for the phase-ﬁeld can be
evaluated from the velocity of the diffuse interface moving
through the local volume with the characteristic spatial
length. Consequently, the rate of decay of the heat ﬂux qW,
solute diffusive ﬂux JW, and phase-ﬁeld rate of change ]F/]t
are estimated by the following characteristic times:
tT = a/VT
2, tD = D/VD
2 , tF = l/V,
s2d
where a is the thermal diffusivity, VT the ﬁnite speed for heat
diffusion si.e., the speed of propagation of temperature dis-
turbancesd, D is the solute diffusion constant, VD is the ﬁnite
speed for diffusion si.e., the speed of propagation of concen-
tration disturbancesd, V is the velocity of the diffuse inter-
face, and l is the spatial length.
For instance, the time tT is deﬁned by phonon-electron
and phonon-phonon interactions for heat diffusion in metal-
lic systems and it is estimated in Ref. f33g to be in the range
of 10−13 s,tT,10−11 s. The time tD is deﬁned by the time
for diffusion jumps of particles, which varies within a wide
interval of 10−11 s,tD,10−7 s in a binary alloy system or
inorganic solution f34g. In addition to this, the time tF might
be evaluated numerically from Eq. s2d, assuming that the
length l=W0 sthe width of the diffuse interfaced and the ve-
locity V sthe characteristic velocity for rapid adiabatic trans-
formationsd are known. Thus, for numeric evaluation of tF in
a pure system, one may accept the following expression:
tF = W0x/sm0Qd,
s3d
where Q is the heat of transformation, x is the heat capacity
sso that relation Q/x is considered as the characteristic tem-
perature for adiabatic transformationd, and m0 is the coefﬁ-
cient for atomic kinetics. Taking the values for pure nickel,
e.g., Q/x=418 K f35g, m0=0.52 m/ss Kd f36g, and W0=5
310−9 m, one gets tF=2.30310−11 s. This value for tF
agrees with the time of the diffuse-interface kinetics which
might be calculated from the “thin-interface” analyses of
Karma and Rappel f37g, extended by Bragard et al. f38g.
It is also reasonable to evaluate the relaxation time for the
phase-ﬁeld in a binary system using the outcomes of the
phase-ﬁeld model via “thin-interface” analyses presented by
Karma and Rappel f37g for pure substances and by Karma
f39g for isothermal solidiﬁcation of dilute binary systems.
Namely, for nonisothermal solidiﬁcation of a binary system,
Ramirez et al. f40g derived the time tF for the phase-ﬁeld as
a function of X and F. It is described by

310−11 s for the values of X=70 at. % and F=0.5.
Values for relaxation times for some pure and binary sys-
tems are summarized in Table I. It can be seen, e.g., for
metals and alloys, that even though the heat speed VT is
much larger than the solute diffusion speed VD, relaxation
times for qW and JW may have the same order of magnitude, i.e.,
tT<tD. Therefore, the front of the heat proﬁle moves with a
speed much higher than the front of the solute diffusive pro-
ﬁle. However, due to the fast thermal diffusion, a@D, the
relaxation of the heat ﬂux qW proceeds at approximately the
same characteristic time as the relaxation for solute diffusion
ﬂux JW.

In Eq. s5d, se is a local equilibrium contribution deﬁned on

the ﬂux-dependent purely nonequilibrium part of the gener-

are the entropies for pure components A and B, respectively.
The chemical potentials and entropies of components can be
chosen for every concrete system ssee, e.g., Refs. f15,17gd.

After integration, the generalized Gibbs equation s5d can
be written in the form

Consequently, we arrive at a generalized entropy density
given by an expansion around its local equilibrium value up
to second order in ﬂuxes. At the limit of inﬁnite speeds sVT
→`, VD→`, and V→`d, one gets tT→0, tD→0, and tF
→0. In such a case, the term sne vanishes and Eq. s8d gives
the entropy density sese,X,Fd for a local equilibrium sys-
tem.

IV. HYPERBOLIC PHASE-FIELD MODEL
In this section, an important class of hyperbolic models
with dissipation is considered. For involved variables we will
formulate explicit evolution equations including the relax-
ation terms.
A. An entropy functional
Now we use an entropy functional of the following form:
S =E
vFsse,X,F,qW,JW,]F/]td −«e
2
2 u ¹ eu2 −«x
2
2 u ¹ Xu2
−«f
2
2 u ¹ Fu2Gdv.
s14d
Here «e, «x, and «f are constants for the energy, concentra-
tion, and phase ﬁeld, respectively. In the functional s14d the
gradient terms u¹eu2, u¹Xu2, and u¹Fu2 are used to describe
a spatial inhomogeneity within the ﬁelds according to previ-
ously formulated diffuse-interface models f8,10,12g. It is
logical to include gradient terms in Eq. s14d sof the so-called
“Ginzburg-Landau form”d because, as stressed before, our
interest is focused on interfaces with steep gradients. In ad-
dition, the extension s1d gives the entropy density s based on
the ﬂuxes qW, JW, and ]F/]t as independent variables.
To obtain an evolution of the entropy, s11d and to consider
several parts of the entropy transfer s12d and s13d, we differ-
entiate Eq. s14d with respect to time. Combining the terms,
after some algebra one obtains

B. Governing equations and thermodynamic
consistency
Relation s18d is well known from the phase-ﬁeld model
that is based on CIT ssee, e.g., Ref. f15gd, whereas the en-
tropy production s19d includes additional terms −aq]qW /]t,
−aj]JW/]t, and −af]2F/]t2 related to the nonequilibrium part
of the generalized entropy. This structure is due to a special
form for entropy, Eq. s8d, and has a clear physical meaning:
far from equilibrium, dissipative ﬂuxes provide ordering that
leads to a decrease of entropy production near a steady state
when compared with the local-equilibrium state character-
ized by same values of e, X, and F.
As a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics
the production sS of the generalized entropy s19d is positive.
This condition implies a relation between ﬂuxes and forces
which, in the simplest cases, is assumed to be linear. For Eq.

plied by Eqs. s20d and s21d assume validity of the represen-

theorem, the ﬂuxes and forces of different tensorial rank do

According to Eq. s26d, the acceleration ]2F/]t2 of the phase
ﬁeld appears due to the introduction of both F and ]F/]t as
independent variables. The acceleration characterizes inertial
effects inside the width of diffuse interface.
The derived equations s24d–s26dare the central outcome
of this study for, to mention a more complicated setting, we
could also refer to equations s20d and s21dg. One role of the
relaxation times is clear: they characterize the delay with
which qW and JW reduce to their classical forms swhich corre-
spond to the classical transport equationsd. Furthermore, this
delay indicates a loss of inertial effects in the dynamics of
the interfacial region. Relaxation terms may be neglected in
many circumstances, but become crucial in some important
situations. For instance, they lead to a maximum possible
value for the speed of advance of the interface sin contrast to
the classic theory which allows for an inﬁnite speed of
propagationd. Moreover, they lead to the possibility of oscil-
latory phenomena appearing within the domain of the inter-
face. Thus, the role of new terms is not simply to add some
new undetermined parameters si.e., the relaxation timesd, al-
lowing for an improved ﬁt with experimental results. These
terms play an important conceptual role, because they open
the possibility for a drastic change in behavior of the mod-
eled system.
Some comments on the consistency of the proposal for-
mulated in this study can be outlined. First of all, we may
refer to its internal consistency as a thermodynamic smacro-
scopicd theory. Second, one must check its consistency with
respect to microscopic descriptions based, for instance, on
kinetic theory, linear response theory, or other statistical smi-
croscopicd theories. Furthermore, one must check its consis-
tency with experimental results.
Here, we comment on the internal thermodynamic consis-
tency ﬁrst. In the next section, we refer to its consistency
with respect to a statistical theory that is based on the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. In this theoretical paper, we
do not refer to experimental results. We assume that a con-
sistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory should satisfy
two main conditions: sid generalized or extended entropy
must be at a maximum in the equilibrium state, siid entropy
production must be positive. To these two conditions, one
could add two more requirements: siiid the second differen-
tial of the entropy with respect to its basic variables swhich is
related to the dynamics of the variablesd must be negative in
order to lead to dynamically stable solutions and sivd the
generalized equations of state obtained by a differentiation of
the generalized entropy must have a physical meaning that
would be consistent with experiments.
It can be seen immediately that the essential conditions sid
and siid are satisﬁed in our proposal. Indeed, the form s8d and
s14d of the entropy guarantees that the homogeneous equilib-
rium state has the maximum entropy as compared to non-
equilibrium states with the same local values of e, X, and F.
Furthermore, an introduction of constitutive equations s20d

s27d
As we noted earlier, the transport matrix sMd and the inter-
face mobility Mf are assumed to be positively deﬁned for a
positive entropy production sS.0. If one includes higher-
order nonlinear terms into the entropy s8d or in the constitu-
tive equations s20d and s21d, thermodynamic consistency
would be more difﬁcult to verify than in our second-order
approximation s8d. This approximation though is sufﬁcient to
deal with a wide range of physical problems.
We shall not deal with conditions siiid and sivd, which are
more subtle and typically involve nonlinear effects. For an
indication of an approach to their analysis in some situations
involving only qW as nonequilibrium variables, the reader is
referred to the monograph f24g.
V. GENERALIZATION OF THE MODEL
The governing equations s24d and s26d present a causal
propagation of heat and mass signals and indicate a
dissipative-wave advance of a diffuse interface. We general-
ize these equations into the so-called evolution equations
which are nonlinear in time. First, the equations of state are
considered from the point of view of the relaxation functions
for the ﬂuxes. Second, the nonlinear evolution equations of a
general type are derived from the variational formulation.
A. Relaxation functions for the ﬂuxes
Let us take into consideration a prehistory of the change
of the phase ﬁeld at a point of a system. Such a prehistory
must be taken into account if the system is not in a local
equilibrium. We shall use a functional description with a
memory function.
We use the entropy functional s14d, as before, to derive
the equations of the model. In the absence of local equilib-
rium, one may incorporate the prehistory of the diffusion
process. Subsequently, connections between the ﬂuxes qW, JW
and ]F/]t from the one side and driving forces ¹sdS/ded,
¹sdS/dXd, and dS/dF, from the other side, are deﬁned by
the following integral forms. Relaxation of the heat ﬂux

s32d
Together with relaxation of the phase ﬁeld s30d, the general
system evolution during the phase transformation is de-
scribed by Eqs. s32d.
When the relaxation functions DR are specially deﬁned,
Eqs. s30d and s32d can be reduced to known models. Speciﬁ-
cally, for an important class of dissipative and hyperbolic
models, one can take the relaxation kernels in the following
forms:
DR =5
DRs0d ; const,
wave propagation,
DRs0ddst −t*d,
dissipation,
DRs0dexpS−t −t*
ti D,
wave and dissipation,6
s33d
where DRs0d=hDqs0d,Djs0d,Dfs0dj are the relaxational ker-
nels for the ﬂuxes at the present time t=t*, and ti
=htT,tD,tFj are the characteristic relaxation times for the
ﬂuxes.
Different transformations within a diffuse interface are
described by different kernels in the integrals s28d–s30d. As it
follows from Eq. s33d, the relaxation functions DR describe
the memory of the system by assigning different weights to
different moments in the past. The dissipation corresponds to
a zero-memory transformation, i.e., the only relevant contri-
butions are the“last”ones. In contrast to this situation, the
inﬁnite memory transformation with DR;const leads to an
undamped wave propagation of the heat, solute, or the inter-
face advancement. In between, the combination of the wave
and dissipative regimes described by the exponentional law
can be observed during rapid phase transformations. This is
the case of a hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model described in Sec.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046125 s2005d
046125-7IV. For the latter case, the relevance of all contributions to
the ﬂuxes decreases as the system moves to the past.
In Sec. IV, the macroscopic consistency of the statements
of EIT has been shown. Now, the consistency of our macro-
scopic approach is veriﬁed with microscopic description. It is
related to the consequences obtained from the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem.
The memory functions introduced in Eqs. s28d–s30d may
be related to our analysis of the dynamics of the ﬂuxes qW and
JW and of ]F/]t proposed by constitutive equations s20d and
s21d. To do this, ﬁrst, we may consider the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem by relating the response memory func-
tions to the time-correlation function of the corresponding
ﬂuxes ssee, e.g., Ref. f50gd. This will allow us to show the
consistency of our macroscopic formulation with the micro-
scopic basis provided by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.
The corresponding expressions are
Dqst −t*d =
1
kBT2kqWˆstdqWˆst*dleq,
Djst −t*d = 1
kBTkJWˆstdJWˆst*dleq,
Dfst −t*d = 1
kBTk]tFˆ std]tFˆ st*dleq.
s34d
Here kB is Boltzmann’s constant; qW, JW, and ]tF stand for the
microscopic operators for the heat ﬂux, diffusion ﬂux and the
time derivative of F, respectively; and k...leq means an av-
erage over an equilibrium ensemble in statistical mechanics
sas, for instance, the canonical oned.
Relations s34d play an important role in modern statistical
mechanics, and may be formally derived from the Liouville
equation in the framework of the linear-response theory or
from information theory f50,51g. However, from a practical
point of view, a computation of the evolution of microscopic
operators for qW, JW or ]tF on purely microscopic grounds is an
overwhelming task that exceeds the actual capabilities of an
analyst. Such an evolution is either obtained by computer
simulations, or inferred on heuristic grounds. Thus, our evo-
lution equations s20d and s21d for qW, JW, and ]tF may be
considered within the scope of macroscopic modeling of the
evolution of ﬂuxes, which according to Eq. s34d is equivalent
to a proposal form of corresponding memory functions intro-
duced in Eqs. s28d–s30d. In general terms, it could be said
that, according to Eq. s34d, the study of the evolution of the
ﬂuxes in the neighborhood of the equilibrium is equivalent to
the determination of the corresponding memory functions.
Constitutive equations s20d and s21d imply that ﬂuctua-
tions of qW and JW near a homogeneous equilibrium state will
decay
exponentially
as
qWstd=qWs0dexps−t/tTd
and
JWstd
=JWs0dexps−t/tDd. Introducing these expressions into Eq. s34d
one obtains
Dqst −t*d =
1
kBT2kqWˆs0dqWˆs0dleqexpS−t −t*
tT D,
Djst −t*d = 1
kBTkJWˆs0dJWˆs0dleqexpS−t −t*
tD D,
s35d
which may be rewritten as
Dqst −t*d = Dqs0dexpS−t −t*
tT D,
Djst −t*d = Djs0dexpS−t −t*
tD D.
s36d
Indeed, when the microscopic expressions for qW and JW scor-
responding to an ideal gasd are introduced into Eq. s36d and
an equilibrium averaging is performed over a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution function, the results for the Dqs0d and
Djs0d became equivalent to those obtained from the kinetic
theory of gases in the time-relaxation approximation f50g.
Note, ﬁnally, that the transport coefﬁcients sthermal con-
ductivity, diffusion coefﬁcientd may be obtained swhen the
relaxation time is sufﬁciently shortd by integration of Eq.
s34d, as

which are the well-known Green-Kubo formulas for trans-
port coefﬁcients f24,50,51g. Thus, our macroscopic formal-
ism is consistent with the microscopic ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem. It provides, in fact, a phenomenological comple-
ment to ﬂuctuation-dissipation expressions, which are the
formal expressions. Note that it is difﬁcult to obtain on exact
grounds the form of the memory functions from these formal
expressions.
B. A variational principle and Euler-Lagrange equations
We assume, as above, that the generalized entropy density
s is a continuous and differentiable function deﬁned by the
local equilibrium contribution se and the ﬂux-dependent non-
equilibrium part sne with the total set of variables s1d and the
generalized Gibbs equation s5d. The balance equations for
the heat and solute are the same, Eqs. s9d, and the local
evolution of the entropy density is described by Eqs. s10d.
A generalization can be formulated by introducing gener-
alized terms for derivatives of the entropy density with re-
spect to classical variables se,X,Fd and ﬂuxes sqW ,JW,]F/]td,
as well as by introducing the general forms of the entropy
ﬂux JWS and the source sS in Eq. s10d. Depending on their
own tensorial character, these are

Locally, Eq. s10d is satisﬁed as a balance law. For the
entire system, one can postulate an extremal condition in the
Lagrangian form L=evs]s/]t+ ¹ ·JWS−sSddv→extr, imply-
ing an extremal difference between the “kinetic” part
evs]s/]t+ ¹ ·JWSddv and the “potential” part evsSdv for the
whole nonequilibrium system. Then, the entropy density sat-
isﬁes the following variational principle f52g:

in which the variation d is carried out only on the noncon-
served ﬂux variables qW, JW, and ]F/]t, i.e., d is taken only
over the space hFj from the set s1d while the variables e, X,
and F from the set hCj remain constant during the variation.
Also, during the variation, the tangent thermodynamic space
ftime and spatial derivatives from the set s1dg is ﬁxed. From
this it follows that Eq. s41d is a variational principle of a
restricted type.
Using the balance laws s9d, a substitution of Eqs. s38d into

entropy density s40d and using variational principle s41d, we
arrive to nonlinear general evolution equations for ﬂuxes
s47d, which can be reduced to evolution equations s20d and
s21d of the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model.
VI. RELATION TO EXISTING MODELS
It is interesting to note that sharp-interface and diffuse-
interface models with relaxation of ﬂuxes have been used to
describe transient processes in various nonequilibrium sys-
tems ssee Ref. f53g, Chap. 4d. Therefore we synthesize here
several previous and some very recent results in comparison
with the developed here hyperbolic model sSec. IVd and the
generalized model sSec. Vd of rapid phase transformation.
A. Superconductivity
Ginzburg and Landau established their variational prin-
ciple for a continuous transition from the normal to the su-
perconducting phase f8g. They used a free energy density
with a gradient term which has been used in further studies
of many phenomena se.g., in a description of the spinodal
decomposition f54g or crystal growth f55gd. As a logical ex-
tension, transition between the normal and superconducting
phases can be described with a delay imposed by equations
of the hyperbolic model fstarting from the functional of the
form s14dg or using generalized models with a memory, Sec.
V A.
Generally, Eqs. s24d–s26d are consistent with the general-
ized entropy density given by Eq. s8d. The equations are
reduced to the classic equations from Refs. f8,54,55g when
the times tend to zero. Furthermore, the entropy density s8d
together with the evolution equations s20d has been justiﬁed
microscopically f24,26g for the one-component system and
from Grad’s procedure for monatomic gases.
The choice of thermodynamic potential is important, as it
governs the transition from a metastable state to the stable
one. Normally, the potential for transition is included in the
expression for the entropy density sor for the free energy
densityd in a form of a double-well function, or by a mono-
tonically increasing function incorporating nonequilibrium
conditions at the interface f8,12,38g. In the present paper, we
do not give an explicit form of se in Eq. s8d and present
governing equations s24d–s26d for variational derivatives
s31dg in a general form. However, the choice of a thermody-
namic potential might be given for a problem under consid-
eration.
B. Glass transition, structural relaxation, and phase
separation
Jäckle et al. f56g considered isothermal phase transforma-
tion in the presence of additional slow structural relaxation
variables. Considering the dynamics based on the relax-
ational chemical potential, these authors refer their model to
systems with phase separation and to slow structural relax-
ation in polymeric solutions in proximity to the glass transi-
tion temperature. Calculations have shown that, even at the
early stages of phase separation, the equation for chemical
potential with a memory may give pronounced deviations
from the predictions obtained by the classic Cahn-Hillard
model f54g.
Phase separation during spinodal decomposition may pro-
ceed under local nonequilibrium conditions in a solute diffu-
sion ﬁeld during rapid quenching. As it has been demon-
strated in computational modeling f57g, rapidly quenched
liquid mixtures under a decomposition exhibit nonequilib-
rium patterns, evolving with universalities different from
those extracted from the Cahn and Hillard model.
Local nonequilibrium separation in liquids can be de-
scribed in terms of EIT. In these cases, such description leads
to a model for isothermal spinodal decomposition in a binary
system f23g sunder conditions of large deviations from the
thermodynamic equilibriumd. The dynamics of the diffusion
ﬂux JW fas a fast variable from the set s1dg is consistent with
the characteristic time of the local rearrangement of particles
satoms or moleculesd, or with the time of relaxation of the
diffusive ﬂux to its local equilibrium steady-state value. The
model equation for spinodal decomposition of a binary sys-
tem is the generalized Cahn-Hillard equation s25d. It is in the
form of local nonequilibrium solute redistribution. In this
case, the dynamics of rapidly quenched decomposition is de-

C. Shear ﬂow, viscoelastic ﬂuids, and diffusion-reaction
systems
The system of coupled evolution equations s20d and s21d
describes, in fact, a process of the phase separation under
shear if temperature is replaced by a viscous pressure tensor.
In this case, one may get the required condition by deﬁning
the spinodal line in nonequilibrium states fsee Ref. f30g,
Chap. 6g. In reduced form, an equation of type s20d or s32d,
accompanied with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions, has been introduced to model behavior of certain vis-
coelastic ﬂuids as well as to predict the velocity of ﬂow f58g.
In addition, an equation of type s32d is used to predict the
wave front in time-delayed reaction-diffusion systems of the
generalized Fisher’s equation f59g. The speed of the traveling
wave depends on the relaxation time, and therefore spreading
of the population in a reaction-diffusion system can be pre-
dicted with great ﬂexibility. One of the consequences of this

046125-10equation, reduced to equations Eqs. s24d or s25d for modeling
hyperbolic reaction-diffusion systems fwith «e=0 or «x=0,
respectivelyg, can be considered in an exciting example sug-
gested by Fort and Mendez in Ref. f60g for advance of
Neolithic human groups across Europe. They have shown
that hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations of type of Eqs.
s24d or s25d predict population spreading during the Euro-
pean past, in agreement with existing archaeological data.
D. Rapid solidiﬁcation
At deep supercoolings in a solidifying system, or at high
velocities of the solid-liquid interface, it is necessary to take
into account local nonequilibrium effects in solute diffusion
phenomena and to use a non-Fickian model for transport
processes compatible with EIT f21,41g. The problem of rapid
solidiﬁcation within the sharp-interface limit is described by
the generalized Stefan problem sthe so-called “self-consistent
hyperbolic Stefan problem” f31,32gd. The analysis in such
cases takes into account local nonequilibrium both at the
interface and within the bulk phases. Consequently, the spa-
tiotemporal evolution of solute concentration is described by
the partial differential equation s25d of a hyperbolic type
swith «x=0d which takes into account the relaxation of solute
diffusion ﬂux into the local thermodynamical equilibrium in
a rapidly solidifying system.
The phenomenon of an advancement of diffuse-interfaces
with higher velocities comparable with the solute diffusion
speed can also be described by the phase-ﬁeld model with a
relaxation of the diffusion ﬂux f23g. It has been shown that
by choosing the concrete form of entropy sas the thermody-
namic potentiald, one may recover the existing models based
on the CIT and analyze solidiﬁcation under local nonequilib-
rium conditions.
E. Motion of antiphase domains
In the description of diffuse interface kinetics, Allen and
Cahn f10g proposed a model for describing the evolution of a
nonconserved order ﬁeld during the antiphase domain coars-
ening. For isotropic interfaces, the gradient ﬂow leads to the
Allen-Cahn equation by taking tF=0 in Eq. s26d. This equa-
tion is valid in cases of low inertial effects versus dissipative
effects. With a ﬁnite relaxation time tF and a ﬁnite accelera-
tion ]2F/]t2, Eq. s26d predicts evolution of coarsening with
relaxation. It is reasonable to say that the generalized Allen-
Cahn equation s26d is valid for cases of signiﬁcant inertial
effects during motion of antiphase domains.
A modiﬁcation of the Allen-Cahn model formulated for
the process of the interface motion by mean curvature with a
delayed response has been analyzed recently. Rotstein et al.
f61g developed the phase-ﬁeld model based on equations
similar to Eqs. s28d and s30d. These authors described the
ﬁrst-order transition with the delayed response of the system
under conditions of a slow relaxation of internal variables.
Using the exponential relaxation function for a wave and
dissipative mode fwhich leads to the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld
model s33dg the dynamics of a perturbed motion of interfaces
by a mean curvature has been considered. It has been shown
in Ref. f61g that the internal relaxation effects induce
damped oscillations in an interfacial motion during the crys-
talline coarsening. As opposed to the classic parabolic phase-
ﬁeld model, the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model predicts these
interfacial oscillations in qualitative consistency with the os-
cillations on the surface of quantum crystals f62g, as is the
case with crystallization waves in helium f63g. From a math-
ematical viewpoint, a search for the existence and unique-
ness of the solution for some well-posed problems of a mo-
tion by mean curvature susing the phase-ﬁeld model with
memoryd is in progress ssee Ref. f64gd.
F. Complex (dusty) plasmas
Recent investigations within the ﬁeld of complex sdustyd
plasma physics show that this system exhibits complicated
behavior which depends on the behavior of its “subsystems.”
These subsystems are represented by electrons, ions, neutral
gas, and charged dust particles. All of them have their own
relaxation times to reach the local equilibrium; therefore, in-
teractions among them may lead to a delay of relaxation to
the local equilibrium in a plasma. Moreover, in the electronic
subsystem of a plasma, local equilibrium does not exist.
Such situations stimulate development of theories beyond a
local equilibrium f65g. Interactions among different sub-
systems in complex sdustyd plasmas with a missing local
thermodynamic equilibrium in the electronic subsystems
make description of observed experimental data of this sys-
tem rather complicated.
Experimental results of Morﬁll et al. f66g related to
plasma observations show unusual behavior attributed to
weak collisionless interactions of gases inherent to ﬂuid ﬂow
with further possible crystallization of plasma. These results
are described by means of molecular dynamic simulations
f66g. The ﬁeld approach seems also to be applicable due to
the fact that during transitions in plasma, the characteristic
size of patterns is on the mesoscopic or even macroscopic
scale. The ﬁeld approach to a heat- and electronically-
conducting ﬂuids has been demonstrated in ionized gases
f52g by using the generalized type of Eqs. s44d–s46d.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The diffuse-interface model for rapid phase transforma-
tions in metastable binary systems has been presented. To
describe the steep but smooth change of phases within the
width of a diffuse interface, the formalism of the phase-ﬁeld
model has been used.
It is emphasized that a rapid phase transformation may
proceed under local nonequilibrium conditions. In a phenom-
enological macroscopic description, we extend the classic set
of independent thermodynamic variables by an inclusion of
dissipative ﬂuxes as additional basic variables. Evolution of
the ﬂuxes is characterized by their own dynamics with relax-
ation times ti summarized in Table I. Thus, the extended set
s1d of variables allows one to describe phase transformations
with ﬁnite interface velocity comparable or even higher than
l/t, where l is the mean-free-path of particles satomsd.
Evolution equations for the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model
with dissipation are derived from entropy functional s14d

046125-11based on the extended set s1d of independent thermodynamic
variables. This model yields a deﬁnite, positive entropy pro-
duction s27d, in full agreement with the second law of ther-
modynamics.
A generalization of the model has been formulated by
introducing the memory functions and using a variational
principle. As a result, consistency of the macroscopic ap-
proach with the microscopic ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem
has been found for the phase-ﬁeld with memory fEqs.
s34d–s37dg. Nonlinear evolution equations s44d–s46d are de-
rived from the variational principle s41d.
Derived equations for an evolution of diffuse interface
were correlated with existing models of nonequilibrium
transport processes and for the systems experiencing phase
transformations. Particularly, we compare our derivation
with the models of superconductivity, phase separation, vis-
coelastic or electronically conducting ﬂuids, interface motion
by mean curvature, rapidly solidifying systems, and reaction-
diffusion systems.
