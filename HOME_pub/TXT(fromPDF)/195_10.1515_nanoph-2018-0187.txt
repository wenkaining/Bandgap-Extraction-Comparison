Abstract: Magneto-optical spectroscopy based on the 
transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) is a sensi-
tive method for investigating magnetically-ordered media. 
Previous studies were limited to the weak coupling regime 
where the spectral width of optical transitions consider-
ably exceeded the Zeeman splitting in magnetic field. 
Here, we investigate experimentally and theoretically the 
transverse Kerr effect in the vicinity of comparatively nar-
row optical resonances in confined quantum systems. For 
experimental demonstration we studied the ground-state 
exciton resonance in a (Cd,Mn)Te diluted magnetic semi-
conductor quantum well, for which the strong exchange 
interaction with magnetic ions leads to giant Zeeman 
splitting of exciton spin states. For low magnetic fields 
in the weak coupling regime, the Kerr effect magnitude 
grows linearly with increasing Zeeman splitting showing 
a dispersive S-shaped spectrum, which remains almost 
unchanged in this range. For large magnetic fields in the 
strong coupling regime, the magnitude saturates, whereas 
the spectrum becomes strongly modified by the appear-
ance of two separate peaks. TMOKE is sensitive not only to 
the sample surface but can also be used to probe in detail 
the confined electronic states in buried nanostructures if 
their capping layer is sufficiently transparent.

1  Introduction
The transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) is 
one of the magneto-optical effects that emerge due to the 
Zeeman splitting of the electron levels in magnetic field [1]. 
Contrary to the widely used Faraday effect, TMOKE is sen-
sitive to the spin component orthogonal to the light propa-
gation direction and is usually used to detect the in-plane 
magnetization of para- and ferromagnetic materials [2–5].
Furthermore, TMOKE is an intensity effect of an inci-
dent light beam that is defined by the relative change of 
reflectance R for the two opposite directions of an in-plane 
magnetic field B:

TMOKE appears only for oblique light incidence with the 
magnetic field orthogonal to the incidence plane and 
in a frequency range where the medium’s absorption is 
nonvanishing [1]. As TMOKE is related to the modifica-
tion of boundary conditions for the incident light by the 
magnetic field, it is valuable for the investigation of mag-
netic properties near the sample’s interface [2, 3]. If the 
boundary conditions at two interfaces of a thin magnetic 
film are different, the transmitted light intensity becomes 
magnetization dependent as well [6].

Usually, TMOKE is observed for ferromagnetic metals 
in the visible and infrared spectral range, where it has a 
typical value of δ ≈ 10−3 and a weak spectral dependence 
[7]. In dielectric materials, the off-resonant TMOKE in 
the transparency range is very weak due to the negligi-
ble absorption. However, resonant TMOKE with notable 
magnitude may be present even in nearly transparent 
media in the vicinity of the absorption band, which is 
provided by spectrally narrow optical resonances. Such 
phenomenon has been recently actively studied in hybrid 
magneto­photonic structures where the optical resonances 
are represented by electromagnetic modes such as surface 
plasmon polaritons [8, 9], waveguide modes [10, 11], or 
optical Tamm states [12]. It was demonstrated that TMOKE 
is drastically enhanced in hybrid metal-dielectric struc-
tures at the resonance of surface plasmon-polaritons [8, 
13–16] and reaches up to δ = 0.15 (see Ref. [17]). Neverthe-
less, due to the strong absorption in metals, the band-
width of the plasmonic resonances Γ significantly exceeds 
the Zeeman splitting Δ, so that the ratio Δ/Γ = 1 holds. In 
this case, the spectral dependence of TMOKE has a char-
acteristic S-shape around the plasmonic resonance: it 
possesses maxima and minima at the slopes of the reso-
nance and crosses zero at the central frequency.
Further types of optical resonances are represented, 
for instance, by confined quantum states such as rare 
earth ions in dielectrics [18, 19] or excitons in semiconduc-
tors [20]. Recently, the enhancement of the polarization 
magneto-optical effects near the excitonic resonance has 
been addressed [21].
Optical resonances related to confined quantum 
states are much narrower as compared to plasmonic exci-
tations. Therefore, the fundamentally new strong coupling 
regime with Δ/Γ ≥ 1 can be established, where the exciton 
damping Γ is slower compared to its spin precession in 
a magnetic field. Consequently, the Zeeman splitting is 
observed in reflectivity in contrast to the weak coupling 
regime with Δ/Γ ≤ 1. Surprisingly, TMOKE was not yet 
studied in this regime irrespective of the studied system.
In this work, we reveal TMOKE in the vicinity of 
narrow optical resonances that originate from exci-
tons. For demonstration purposes, we focus on excitons 
in diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) quantum 
well (QW) structures. Here, the exchange interaction 
of magnetic ions with the conduction band electrons  
(s – d) and valence band holes (p – d) allows to achieve 
a large exciton Zeeman splitting with Δ/Γ > 1 already 
in moderate magnetic fields [20, 22, 23]. In particu-
lar, we demonstrate the enhancement of TMOKE in 
the vicinity of exciton resonances in a 10-nm-thick 
(Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW. We should underline that 
although TMOKE is used to be sensitive to the surface 
effects, in case of relatively transparent cap layer as it 
happens in the addressed semiconductor QW structures, 
TMOKE serves as an efficient probe tool for the confined 
states in depth, where the QW is located.
In what follows, first, we consider TMOKE theoreti-
cally for a generic three-level system and confirm that the 
TMOKE features observed at the exciton resonance are 
inherent to a broad class of optical resonances caused by 
confined quantum states. Second, we demonstrate reso-
nant TMOKE for spectrally narrow excitonic resonances in 
a (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW structure.

2.1  Theory of TMOKE near the resonance of a 
three-level system
In order to identify the general properties of TMOKE in the 
vicinity of a spectrally narrow optical resonance, let us 
theoretically study TMOKE in a simplified magneto-optical 
model for the electric dipole optical transitions in a three-
level quantum system, which is realized in a large variety 
of atomic, molecular, and solid-state objects with pseu-
dospin in the excited or ground state [24–26]. In particu-
lar, one example of such systems is represented by a single 
level in the ground state (g), which is coupled through 
the optical field to two excited states (e, with ­pseudospin 
projection 
1
2
yS = ± ). The latter are split due to the Zeeman 
effect. The selection rules for optical ­transitions dictate 
that excitation with an electromagnetic wave, which pos-
sesses σ+ circular polarization in the xz-plane, addresses 
the state with angular momentum projection

yS = +  and 
correspondingly

yS = − for σ− polarization. Due to the 
Zeeman splitting Δ, their energies are split from the central 
one E0 by Δ/2: E = E0 ± Δ/2 (see Figure 1A).
These transitions cause resonances in the permittivity 
tensor εij = εδij – ieijkgk, where gk is the gyration vector, eijk is 
the Levi-Civita tensor, and i, j, k = x, y, z [1]. In the case of 
the magnetic field directed along the y-axis, the permittiv-
ity tensor components are

Relatively simple analytical expressions for TMOKE 
[Supplementary Eq. (S1)] can be obtained for the light 
reflection from a semi-infinite magnetic medium. The 
principle scheme of the considered geometry of the light 
incidence and the applied magnetic field is shown in 
Figure 1B.
We start the asymptotic analysis of Eq. (S1) for the 
weak coupling regime (Δ/Γ = 1), which gives the follow-
ing expression for TMOKE [see Supplementary Eq. (S2)]:

 Here 
and below, we assume that the incidence angle θ is 
small enough so that we can neglect tan2 θ with respect 
to εb. As follows from Eqs. (2) and (3) TMOKE is propor-
tional to the damping Γ and exists only within the spec-
tral range where the imaginary part of the permittivity is 
not vanishing. In this sense, it is similar to the effect of 
magnetic dichroism. TMOKE grows linearly with Δ and

At the same time, the shape of the TMOKE spectrum does 
not change with the magnetic field for Δ/Γ = 1.
Narrow optical resonances in sufficiently large mag-
netic fields lead to the other limiting case when Δ/Γ ? 1. 
Analyzing the general expression for TMOKE [Supplemen-
tary Eq. (S1)], we should take into account that the reso-
nances of TMOKE are located at |E0 – E | = Δ/2. We treat Γ/Δ 
as a small parameter and derive the analytical expression 
for TMOKE peaks in case Δ/Γ ? 1 (details in Supplemen-
tary Section A):

Negative TMOKE refers to E0 – E > 0 and positive TMOKE 
corresponds to E0 – E < 0. TMOKE spectra for the strong 
coupling regime are presented in Figure 2B. Contrary to 
the previous situation of weak coupling, the relatively 
large magnetic field changes the shape of the TMOKE 
spectrum when Δ > Γ: it comprises two separate peaks of 
opposite sign, and the energy distance between the peaks 
corresponds to the Zeeman splitting Δ and consequently 
increases with the applied magnetic field. Another inter-
esting feature of the strong coupling regime is the fact 
that the TMOKE peak magnitude experiences saturation. 
When Δ and Γ are almost equal, one can see that the 
TMOKE peaks behave like in the weak coupling regime, 
and the maximal TMOKE gradually grows. However, this 
initial increase of TMOKE ceases, when the ratio Δ/Γ 
exceeds about 5. Now, the relatively large Zeeman split-
ting approximation is fulfilled. Henceforth, the maximum 
value of TMOKE does not depend on Δ. Similarly to the 
weak coupling regime, the dependence of TMOKE on the 
incidence angle is linear as one can see from Eq. (5).
Thus, in large magnetic fields, when the Zeeman split-
ting exceeds the resonance linewidth, one can observe 
novel features that do not exist in case of small magnetic 
fields. Namely, the TMOKE spectrum shape changes with 
magnetic field: it has two peaks of opposite sign and these 
peaks move away from each other with increasing mag-
netic field. Moreover, in contrast to the weak coupling 
regime, the peak magnitude does not depend on the 
applied magnetic field. These general features have been

ascertained for the simplest case when the p-polarized 
beam is reflected from a semi-infinite magnetic material 
with one narrow resonance. For more complex systems, 
additional peculiarities emerge, nevertheless preserving 
the general properties discussed above.
As confined quantum states can be formed not only 
near the sample surface but also at some region in the bulk 
(e.g. in the QW inside a semiconductor sample with a cap 
layer), it is important to consider the case when the mag-
neto-optical resonance appears in a thin layer buried at 
some distance from the sample surface. Although TMOKE 
is considered as a surface-sensitive effect, in this case, it 
can be useful for probing confined resonances in depth. 
For this purpose, we analyze a trilayer structure composed 
of the cap layer of varying thickness, the 10-nm-thick QW 
layer with the dielectric permittivity tensor given by Eq. 
(2), and the buffer layer (see Figure 3A). The variation of 
the cap layer thickness modifies the shape of TMOKE reso-
nance with a period of 120 nm, which is half of the light 
wavelength in the cap layer (Figure 2C). Additionally, one 
can achieve a fully antisymmetric TMOKE spectral shape 
as it occurs for the 90 nm cap layer.
The TMOKE features discussed above can be observed 
in different systems that possess sharp optical resonances 
originating from confined quantum states. In the next 
section, we concentrate on the experimental demonstra-
tion of these features for the case of exciton resonances in 
magnetic semiconductor QW structures.
2.2  TMOKE at the exciton resonance in 
semiconductor QW
To investigate TMOKE mediated by excitons in a DMS, we 
use a sample with a QW structure grown by molecular-beam 
epitaxy on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate. The 10-nm-
thick DMS Cd0.974Mn0.026Te QW layer is sandwiched between 
nonmagnetic Cd0.73Mg0.27Te barriers (buffer and cap layers; 
see Methods and Figure 3A). TMOKE measurements were 
performed in two regimes: (i) the weak coupling regime 
in magnetic field of B = 580 mT at a temperature T ≈ 10 K 
and (ii) the strong coupling regime where the magnetic 
field was varied in 125 mT steps from 0.5 to 5.0 T at T = 2 K. 
For the first case, TMOKE spectra were obtained in a wide 
range of incidence angles using a Fourier imaging setup. 
In the second case, the measurements were performed 
for θ = 5°. In both cases, the magnetic field was oriented 
in the QW plane and perpendicular to the plane of light 
incidence as shown in Figure 3A. The details on the meas-
urement procedure and evaluation of TMOKE spectra are 
presented in Section 4.
2.3  TMOKE in the weak coupling regime
Figure 4 summarizes the data obtained in the weak cou-
pling regime of excitonic states. Reflection spectra of the 
structure show oscillations related to the interference of 
light after multiple reflections within the (Cd,Mg)Te buffer 
layer (Figure 4A, solid curve). The exciton resonance from 
the DMS QW is represented by a weak feature in the reflec-
tion spectrum at a photon energy of about 1.683 eV. In 
contrast, the TMOKE spectrum presented in Figure 4B at 
θ = 5° shows a much more abundant picture with two reso-
nances located at 1.683 and 1.701 eV. This result highlights 
the sensitivity of TMOKE spectroscopy.
The presence of two exciton resonances in the TMOKE 
spectrum of the DMS QW structure is related to the quanti-
zation of carriers inside the QW as well as uniaxial strain 
in the direction along the normal to the QW [27]. For that

reason, the light-hole (lh) and heavy-hole (hh) exciton reso-
nances, which are degenerate in a bulk crystal, split into 
the lh state with Elh(B = 0) = 1.701 eV and the hh state with 
Ehh(B = 0) = 1.683 eV. The corresponding energies are marked 
by dotted vertical lines in Figure 4A and B. The light- 
heavy-hole splitting is equal to Δlh = 18 meV. Both TMOKE 
resonances are observed for oblique incidence near the 
frequencies of the corresponding transitions from the hole 
states and have antisymmetric S-shape. The exciton-medi-
ated TMOKE grows with increase of the incidence angle, 
reaching 1.1% at θ = 20° (Figure 4C), which is several orders 
of magnitude larger than the off-resonant value of 0.01%, 
observed at θ = 20° and photon energy around 1.58 eV.
We emphasize that the lh exciton feature in the pho-
toluminescence and reflectivity spectra is too weak to 
determine the position of the resonance, which is mainly 
due to its fast relaxation into the ground state correspond-
ing to the hh exciton. In contrast, the TMOKE spectrum 
can be used to determine the positions of both exciton 
resonances. Interestingly, the strength of TMOKE is about 
twice larger for lh excitons than for the hh state and the 
sign of the effect is opposite. In other words, for positive

incidence angle θ, the TMOKE magnitude for the lh exciton 
changes from positive to negative values with increas-
ing photon energy E (rising S-shape), whereas for the hh 
exciton an opposite behavior with decreasing S-shape is 
observed as shown in Figure 4B.
Heavy-hole excitons show a smaller magnitude of 
TMOKE because at zero magnetic field the correspond-
ing transitions are linearly polarized in the QW plane and 
hence carry zero spin along the magnetic field direction. 
Hence, TMOKE for the hh resonance is enabled only due to 
the admixture of lh states at nonzero magnetic field. That 
explains why the hh TMOKE remains relatively weak until 
the Zeeman splitting becomes comparable to the light-heavy-
hole splitting. It also hints to the origin of the different sign 
for light-holes and heavy-holes, which will be explained 
more intuitively once we consider higher magnetic fields.
Now, we proceed to a quantitative description of the 
TMOKE resonance for hybridized lh and hh states at weak 
magnetic field. To that end, we have calculated the effec-
tive permittivity tensor of the QW. The orbital effects of the 
magnetic field, which can mix lh and hh resonances and 
induce spatial dispersion [28], were neglected. In the case 
of a DMS structure, these effects are less important than 
the Mn-mediated giant Zeeman splitting. The resulting QW 
permittivity tensor can be presented as ε = εb(1 + χhh + χlh), 
with the hh and lh susceptibilities in the xz subspace (Ox 
is in the QW plane and perpendicular to the external field 
and Oz is normal to the QW plane; see Figure 3A). The sus-
ceptibilities read (see Section B of Supplementary Materi-
als for the derivation details):

eV is the p – d exchange interaction constant, S = 5/2 is the 
Mn spin, x is the concentration of Mn2+ ions, and BS(k) is the 
modified Brillouin function describing the magnetization 
of Mn ions at given magnetic field and temperature [20, 22, 
23, 29]. For S = 5/2, the argument of BS(k) is defined as k = 5μB 
gMnB/2kBTeff with the Bohr magneton μB, the Boltzmann 
constant kB, the Landé factor of Mn2+ ion gMn = 2.01, and the

of the investigated structure x ≈ 0.026 and T0 ≈ 1.5 K were 
evaluated from the magnetic field dependence of hh 
exciton splitting in the Faraday geometry Δh,F measured 
using photoluminescence spectroscopy [30].
The TMOKE response is described by the off-diagonal 
elements of the susceptibilities (6). The different signs 
before these elements for lh and hh reflect different signs of 
the TMOKE response. Because of the term ∝(Elh,− – Elh,+)/Dlh, 
for light-holes, TMOKE is possible even when the mixing 
with the heavy-holes is neglected, i.e. 
0.

Z
 Note that the 
mixing term Z is determined solely by the energy struc-
ture of the valence band states, i.e. proportional to Δh,F/Δlh, 
whereas the energy splitting of the exciton resonances is 
governed by the Zeeman splitting of both valence band and 
conduction band states as shown in Figure 3B and C. The 
contribution from the electrons is given by Δe = N0αxSBS, 
where N0α = 0.22 eV is the s – d exchange interaction con-
stant between the conduction band electrons and Mn2+ 
ions in (Cd,Mn)Te. The corresponding splittings for lh and 
hh excitons are given by ΔX,v = Ev,+ – Ev,− + Δe with v = lh, hh, 
respectively. A detailed description of the magnetic field 
induced splitting of exciton resonances in the Voigt geo­
metry is given in Section B of Supplementary Materials.
Using the transfer matrix method for multilayer 
DMS structures with the QW described by Eq. (6), we 
calculated the reflectance and TMOKE spectra. They 
show good agreement with the experimental data if 
Elh = 1.7005  eV and Ehh = 1.6825 eV are assumed (Figure 
4A and B, dashed curves). The longitudinal-transverse 
splitting is ħωLT = 0.65  meV, whereas the linewidth and 
Zeeman splitting of both resonances are Γhh = Γlh = 2.4 meV, 
ΔX,hh = 1.2 meV, and ΔX,lh = 4.3 meV. Therefore, in the exter-
nal magnetic field of 580 mT, Δ is of the order of Γ, and in 
Figure 4B and C, we deal with the weak coupling regime.
2.4  TMOKE in the strong coupling regime
As the exciton resonances are quite narrow, the strong 
coupling regime (Δ/Γ ? 1) is already reachable in mag-
netic fields of several Tesla, i.e. if the temperature is kept

low enough (T = 2 K) that the ratio Δ/Γ exceeds 5 at B = 2 T 
and is about 10 at B = 5 T.
TMOKE spectra and their dependence on magnetic 
field strength up to 5 T for θ = 5° are presented in Figure 5. 
It follows that for Δ/Γ ? 1 each of the resonant TMOKE fea-
tures corresponding to hh and lh excitons at B = 0 split into 
two resonance features. The splitting increases with the 
increase of B. Remarkably, TMOKE maximum/minimum 
values are saturated at B = 1  T and remain constant for 
higher fields. Consequently, in this regime, the magnetic 
field influences the shape of the TMOKE spectrum but 
does not increase its value of δ = 0.5%.
To interpret the four branches in TMOKE spectra at 
higher B, let us consider the case of the Zeeman energy, 
which overcomes the light-heavy-hole splitting (
1
Z ≫) 
in magnetic fields higher than 1 T (see Figure 3). In this 
regime, a simple qualitative picture can be considered, 
which is realized in a bulk (Cd,Mn)Te crystal. In Voigt 
configuration (B | | y), the Zeeman-split electron states are 
characterized by the spin projection Se,y = ±1/2 representing 
a doublet. The valence band states split into a quartet with 
Zeeman energy governed by the total angular momentum 
projection on the magnetic field direction Jh,y = ± 1/2, ±3/2. 
Note that the case of strong magnetic field is fundamen-
tally different from the case of weak magnetic field where 
the quantization axis is given by the QW confinement 
potential; therefore, the energies of the valence band 
states are mainly determined by the normal projection 
of the angular momentum Jh,z = ± 1/2, ±3/2 for lh and hh, 
respectively.
Neglecting the QW confinement, the splittings 
of conduction and valence band states are given by

 respectively. 
Thus, we obtain four σ-polarized exciton transitions. The 
energy splitting between the outer hh-like components 
Δout = Δh + Δe correspond to the excitonic states |± 3/2, ±1/2⟩ 
written in the |Jh,y,Se,y⟩ notation. The inner components 
are split by Δin = Δh/3 – Δe corresponding to lh-like exciton 
resonances |± 1/2, m1/2⟩. Following Figure 5, the splitting 
Δout ≈ 70 meV, whereas Δin is about eight times smaller at 
B = 5 T. According to the s – d and p – d exchange con-
stants in bulk (Cd,Mn)Te, the relation Δout > Δin > 0 holds 
[20]. In this case, the two optical transitions with lower 
energy |−3/2, −1/2⟩ and |−1/2, +1/2⟩ are σ+-polarized in the 
xz-plane, while the upper energy transitions |+3/2, +1/2⟩ 
and |+1/2, −1/2⟩ have opposite σ− polarization (see also 
Figure 3C). The form of the S-shaped resonances in large 
magnetic field is in full accord with this considerations: it 
has a rising slope for the low-energy exciton transitions at 
1.666 and 1.688 eV and changes to falling for the higher-
energy resonances at 1.696 and 1.733 eV. This also explains 
the opposite sign of the lh and hh TMOKE resonances 
observed in the limit of small magnetic fields (Figure 4).
The susceptibilities at large fields can be simpli-
fied to a compact antisymmetric form (Supplementary

3  Discussion
To conclude, we have demonstrated here the enhance-
ment of TMOKE in the vicinity of a narrow optical 
resonance. There are two distinct TMOKE regimes that 
depend on the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting with 
respect to the linewidth. In the weak coupling regime 
(Δ < Γ), the TMOKE magnitude grows linearly with the 
increase of the Zeeman splitting and its spectrum has an 
S-shape. On the contrary, in the strong coupling regime 
(Δ > Γ), the TMOKE magnitude saturates, whereas its 
spectrum is strongly modified with the increase of 
the Zeeman splitting leading to the appearance of two 
separate TMOKE peaks. The spectral dependence of the 
TMOKE peaks and the sign of δ provide rich information 
on the energy structure and selection rules for optical 
transitions.
Although in this work the considered phenomena 
were experimentally demonstrated at the exciton reso-
nances in a 10-nm-thick (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW, they 
can also be found in other physical systems. For example, 
the optical resonances of the rare-earth ions in dielectric 
materials are quite narrow so that Γ  ≤  Δ even in moder-
ate magnetic fields. In this respect, X-ray spectra of the 
confined quantum states are of interest [18, 31, 32]. For 
instance, the rare-earth ions in orthoborates provide 
lines with Δ/Γ ≈ 1 in B ≈ 1 T [18]. Apart from X-ray, the 
visible and infrared spectra also demonstrate narrow 
lines [19, 33–36].
Our results have several implications in fundamental 
and applied optics. First, resonant TMOKE in the strong 
coupling regime can be used as a spectroscopic tool for 
the investigation of the energy structure of electronic 
states that are involved in optical transitions. It should 
be noted that although TMOKE is usually considered as 
a surface sensitive effect, it is demonstrated here to be 
applicable for probing confined resonances in the depth 
of the sample as well.
Next, resonant TMOKE can be used to read out the 
in-plane magnetization of the system, which is appeal-
ing for possible applications in quantum information and 
sensing technologies [37, 38]. Typically, the spin dynamics 
in semiconductors is assessed by the polarization rotation 
due to the Faraday effect or Polar Kerr effect (PMOKE) [39]. 
However, these give access only to one of the spin compo-
nents parallel to the direction of light propagation (B | | k). 
On the contrary, TMOKE allows measuring the perpen-
dicular component of the magnetization. Thus, a combi-
nation of TMOKE and PMOKE provides the possibility for 
performing spin tomography.
4  Methods
To investigate TMOKE mediated by excitons in a DMS, we 
used a QW structure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy 
on a 400-μm-thick (001)-oriented GaAs substrate. The 
10-nm-thick magnetic Cd0.974Mn0.026Te QW layer is sand-
wiched between nonmagnetic Cd0.73Mg0.27Te barriers 
(3.25-μm-thick buffer and 250-nm-thick cap layer, respec-
tively). Qualitatively, the same results were obtained with 
another sample. The 10-nm-thick QW layer was sand-
wiched in between 3.05-μm-thick buffer and 30-nm-thick 
cap layer. The only difference observed is the change of 
TMOKE spectral shape as discussed above in Section 2.1 
and shown in Figure 2C.
The experimental studies were performed on the 
following two set-ups. In the weak coupling regime, 
the sample was placed in a He flow cryostat between 
the ferrite cores of an electromagnet. Fourier imaging 
spectroscopy was used to measure the angular- and 
wavelength-resolved reflectivity and TMOKE spectra at 
low temperatures of about 10 K using a tungsten halogen 
lamp, which illuminates the sample with p-polarized 
light. The reflected light was collimated using a micro-
scope objective with numerical aperture of 0.4, resulting 
in the experimentally accessible angular range of ±23°. A 
telescope consisting of two achromatic doublets mapped 
the collimated light onto the spectrometer slit. The exit slit 
of the spectrometer was equipped with a thermoelectric 
cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector, providing a 
spectral resolution of 0.6 nm and an angular resolution of 
about 0.4°. By taking the reflected intensity for two oppo-
site magnetic field directions, the parameter δ character-
izing TMOKE was deduced. For these rather low magnetic 
field strengths, the noise level is reduced by repeti-
tive switching of the magnetic field direction. This also 
smoothes potential fluctuations of the lamps intensity.
On the contrary, in the giant Zeeman splitting case, 
the sample was kept at a temperature of 1.6  K inside a 
liquid helium bath cryostat equipped with a split-coil 
superconducting magnet. Transverse magnetic fields 
of up to 5 T were applied to observe the magnetic field 
induced change of reflectivity for p-polarized white light 
incident under an angle of 5°. The reflected light was sub-
sequently dispersed by the spectrometer and detected 
with the CCD detector. The sweeping of the current in the 
superconducting magnet is slow; therefore, it does not 
allow to perform repetitive measurements in two opposite 
magnetic fields within a reasonable time. Therefore, we 
swept the magnetic field once in steps of 125 mT from −5 
to 5 T and back again. For each magnetic field step, we

measured the reflected intensity multiple times in both 
p- and s-polarizations. In this case, potential intensity 
fluctuations of the white light source are smoothed by nor-
malizing each p-polarized spectrum to the spectrally inte-
grated s-polarized intensity for each magnetic field step 
Ip(B, ω)/Is(B). Using the spectrally integrated s-polarized 
intensity for normalization has the advantage that other-
wise small temperature deviations might slightly shift the 
optical resonances and consequently change the spectral 
dependence of TMOKE.
