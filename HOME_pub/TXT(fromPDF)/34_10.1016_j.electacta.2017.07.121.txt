The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the practical air cathode in a Lithium-air cell,
which is conventionally composed of porous carbon with or without catalysts supported on it, was
investigated. The mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied on a
porous carbon electrode in an oxygen saturated solution of 0.1 M Lithium bis-triﬂuoromethanesulfo-
nimide (LiTFSI) in Dimethoxyethane (DME) using cyclic voltammetery (CV) and the rotating ring-disk
electrode (RRDE) technique. The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar
potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of porosity and
the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required
for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar
GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us
and the rate constants for the elementary reactions were calculated. The rates constant for the
electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for
smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the
intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the
electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the ﬁlm pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode
porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical.

1. Introduction
The mitigation of “range anxiety” hindering the adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs) requires that EVs on a single charge match
the range of a gasoline powered car with a full tank. A range of 500
miles per charge, which would satisfy this requirement, requires
the commercialization of “beyond Li-ion” battery systems. The Li-
O2 cell is one of the best candidates due to its high theoretical
speciﬁc energy of 3505 Wh Kg1 which is signiﬁcantly higher than
current lithium-ion cells [1,2]. The practical use of this promising
technology is beset by problems of the high overvoltage leading to
low columbic efﬁciency [1–3], Li dendrite growth on the anode [4],
side reactions with N2 and H2O in air [5,6], and unstable
electrolytes leading to short cycle life [7–10],
During oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), O2 or O2
 (formed by
outer sphere electron transfer) is adsorbed onto the cathode and
reacts with Li+ to form LiO2 through a net one electron transfer
reaction. Li2O2 is formed from LiO2 via a subsequent electrochemi-
cal reaction or by a chemical disproportionation reaction [10,11]. A
consensus exists in the literature that Li2O2 is the ﬁnal discharge
product of the Li-O2 cell following extensively studies using in-situ
[12–14] and ex-situ techniques [15] but the elementary steps
involved in the ORR are less well understood. The chemical
disproportionation of LiO2 is considered a major reaction route
[14–19] with reports of its occurrence in the electrolyte bulk [15–
17], on the electrode surface [18,19] or as a hybrid surface-
electrolyte mechanism [14]. It is evident from the literature that

AFM [34,40] or EQCM [19,34] for example, have led to radically
different conclusions as to the overall mechanism. Several of these
studies [12,34,40] also employ unstable [11,41,42] DMSO as the
electrolyte solvent, necessitating the data obtained to be examined
in this context. Thus, the elucidation of the Li-O2 ORR mechanism
is complicated by the interplay of factors such the solvent
[15,16,21], salt [43,44], applied overpotential [14] and electrolyte
water content [6,21].
The applicability of the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE)
technique to elucidate complex reaction mechanisms in non-
aqueous systems has been reported previously [11,21,22,35]. The
present study seeks to use the RRDE technique to examine the Li+
ORR on practical, porous carbon electrodes. Porous carbon
electrodes have been extensively used as cathodes for Li-rO2 cells
[3,4,10,22–27]. The inﬂuence of the carbon surface on Li2O2
deposits on the cathode has been examined by us previously [23]
and others have examined the corresponding oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) [25]. In the present study, we combine RRDE
measurements and a kinetic model to calculate the rate constants
for each of the elementary steps,the competition between the
surface and bulk reactions is quantiﬁed and the effects of cathode
porosity on the elementary reaction rate constants are examined. .
2. Experimental Methods
The carbon black mixture was prepared by mixing 10 mg carbon
black (CB, acetylene, 100% compressed, surface area: 80 m2g1,
>99.9%, Alfa Aesar) with 10 wt% polytetraﬂuorethylene solution
(PTFE, 60 wt% dispersion in water, Sigma Aldrich) followed by the
addition of 3 ml of isopropanol to the CB/PTFE mixture solution to
dilute the mixture. The mixture was dispersed with a sonicator
(Qsonica, frequency: 20 KHz) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
The glassy carbon (GC) disk of the RRDE system was roughened
using sand paper and recessed  1 mm below the lip of the
surrounding teﬂon holder. The CB ﬁlm was deposited by dropping
7 ml of CB/PTFE slurry onto the recessed, roughened GC disk
electrode (surface area: 0.196 cm2) and dried in an oven at 40  C for
15 minutes. This CB coating process was repeated three times until
uniform surface coverage was achieved and the ﬁlm was ﬂush with
the RRDE assembly surface. Finally, the porous CB disk electrode
was dried in a vacuum oven at 40  C for 12 hours to remove all
water and solvent.
The 0.1 M solution of Lithium bis-triﬂuoromethanesulfonimide
(LiTFSI) (99.95%, Aldrich) in 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (DME) (Sigma-
Aldrich, ReagentPlus, 99%) was prepared in a MBraun Ar ﬁlled
glove box with H2O and O2 levels <0.5 ppm. The LiTFSI salt was
dried in a vacuum oven for 24 hours at 40 C and the DME was
distilled, Ar purged and stored in an Ar ﬁlled glove box to ensure
absence of moisture before use. The water content in the “as-
received” DME was measured using Karl-Fisher titration (Mettler
Toledo C30 Coulometric KF Titrator) and the water content was
found to be 77.6 ppm. Similarly, the water content of the electrolyte
was measured after preparation and found to be 76.8 ppm.
The electrochemical experiments were carried out with a
multi-channel potentiostat (Solartron Analytical) with indepen-
dent leads for potential and current. A 50-ml ﬂask, ﬁtted with a
custom designed Teﬂon top with openings for the working,
referenceand counter electrodes and an inlet for the gas purge line,
was used for the RRDE measurements. The three-electrode system
consisted of Pt gauze (Alfa Aesar, 45 mesh, <99.9%) on a Pt wire as
reference and counter electrodes. The working electrode was a
Pine instruments RRDE with the CB coated GC disk surrounded by a
Pt ring with a rated collection efﬁciency (N) of 0.25 and used in
conjunction with the supplied rotor shaft and gas purged bearing
assembly. The entire setup was assembled in the glove box and
sealed. Upon transfer out of the glovebox, the gas inlet was
immediately connected to an Ar source to maintain the Ar blanket
over the electrolyte surface. The gas purged bearing assembly was
connected to a second Ar source to prevent ingress of atmospheric
air during RRDE shaft rotation. The Pt pseudo-reference was
calibrated with respect to the Li/Li+ couple using a ferrocene/
ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal reference as recommended by IUPAC
[45]. The calibration procedure and resultant graphs are in
supplementary materials Section 1.
The background cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were measured in
the Ar saturated state after a 30 min Ar purge. The CVs were then
measured using different scan rates in the O2 saturated condition
after O2 purge for 1 hour. For the RRDE measurements, the working
electrode rotation rate was controlled by a MSRX speed controller
(Pine Instruments). The ring potential was held at 3.58 V which was
chosen to achieve complete oxidation of reduced species produced
at the disk. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were
measured from 2.9 to 1.4 V vs Li/Li+ based on the location of the
ORR peak identiﬁed from the CV.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Electrochemical measurements
The oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution current was
measured on the porous CB coated GC electrode disk. Fig. 1 shows
CVs measured over the potential range of the ORR and OER with
different scan rates in O2 saturated 0.1 M LiTFSI in DME electrolyte.
The background CV was measured in Ar saturated electrolyte and
parasitic side reactions were not observed in this voltage range. A
peak seperation of 1300 mV was measured with a 5 mV s1 scan
rate and hence was found to be higher than the theoretical value
for a one electron reversible reaction (59 mV). The ORR and OER
peak shifts were seen to be in agreement with the suggestion of a
30/a mV shift for a 10 fold increase in scan rate [29].
The electrochemical kinetic analysis for the ORR was carried out
by combining the RRDE technique with an electro-kinetic model. A
detailed discussion of the use of RRDE measurements for non-
aqueous ORR reactions can be found in our recent works [11,20].
Fig. 2 shows the RRDE measurements on the porous CB disk and Pt
ring system carried out with the CB disk being potentiodynami-
cally scanned at a rate of 2 mV s1and the Pt ring being held at
3.58 V vs Li/Li+. The LSVs of the porous CB disk showed the typical
observation that the limiting currents (iL) are directly proportional
to the square root of rotation rate (v1
2).

5713.2. Kinetic analysis
The Koutecky-Levich equation describes the current measured
by a rotating disk electrode if the ORR kinetics is ﬁrst order with
respect to dissolved oxygen. The disk current and square root of
rotation rate have the relation given by Eq. (1):

i ¼ 1

where ik is the kinetic current. Thus, the slope of a typical
Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot (i1 vs. v1

equal a constant B given by Eq. (2):
B ¼ 0:62nFAD

ð2Þ
Where F is 96,485C mol1, A is the geometric area of disk, D is the
diffusion coefﬁcient of O2 (2.78  106 cm2 s1 in 0.1 M LITFSI/
DME) [22], Cb is the bulk concentration of O2 (9.57  10–6 molcm-3)
[30], and n is the kinematic viscosity (5.22  103 cm s1). The
presence of the CB ﬁlm potentially complicates the analysis of the
K-L plot compared to the case of the smooth electrode described
above. In case the ﬁlm was porous enough to allow for ﬂow inside
the pores, the current versus rotation rate proﬁle has been shown
to have a sigmoidal proﬁle with the current being linear below a
certain critical rotation rate and increasing exponentially above
this value [33]. On the other hand, for dense porous materials like
most carbons used in electrodes, the pores would be too small for
ﬂow to occur inside them [33]. The transport regime in the ﬁlm in
such cases is expected to be dominated by diffusion, with the
respective contributions from Fickian and Knudsen diffusion
depending on the pore size distribution. Apart from the convective
transport to the disk surface and kinetics on the disk surface that
can serve as the limiting factor (depending on the potential), in a
porous electrode system we may also need to consider the diffusive
transport through the ﬁlm, possible reaction rate limitation at the
redox centers inside the ﬁlm and partitioning between the ﬁlm
surface and the ﬁlm bulk (i.e. inside the pores) [29]. The various
possibilities and the Koutecky-Levich like equations applicable to
these cases are comprehensively discussed elsewhere [29,36]. It is
to be noted that the effect of these various possible limiting factors

held at 3.58 V vs Li/Li+.

J. Seo et al. / Electrochimica Acta 248 (2017) 570–577is typically an additional contribution to the limiting current,
leading to a non-zero intercept for the 1/i vs. v1
2 plots at the
limiting current region. Depending on the ﬁlm and the postulated
limiting factor in the ﬁlm, this non-zero intercept is treated
suitably. The slope of the K-L plot and hence kinetic calculations
such as the number of electrons is unaffected. In the present case,
for a uniform, conducting carbon ﬁlm the diffusion process in the
ﬁlm is believed to be the dominant contribution to the ﬁlm current.
To account for this ﬁlm current, we may re-write the K-L equation
as follows [29]:

i ¼ 1
ik
þ

þ 1
if ilm
 

ð3Þ
The depletion layer at the disk disappears at high enough
rotation rate and hence we may assume that the reactant
concentration exposed to the disk would be the same as the bulk
concentration. Thus, the ﬁlm current maybe represented as [29]:
if ilm ¼
nFADf ilmkCO2;bulk
f
ð4Þ
The reaction occurring on the ﬁlm surface vs. the pores can be
distinguished through the partition coefﬁcient k (assuming the
same rate expression in both the pores and the surface) and the
pore diffusion can be characterized by the ﬁlm diffusion coefﬁcient
Dﬁlm.
Interestingly, it was observed that while there is a small ﬁlm
current at the start of the limiting current region (1.8 V), this
current disappears at higher overpotentials (1.4 V). This may
indicate that at high enough overpotentials the reactions on the
ﬁlm surface are so rapid as to consume all reactants reaching the
surface before they have an opportunity to diffuse into the ﬁlm
bulk. Nevertheless, calculating the Df ilmk
f
term using the ﬁlm current
at 1.8 V (1.03 mA), a value of 5.7  105 m.s1 was obtained. Since
the ﬁlm is 1 mm thick, this leads to a ﬁlm diffusion coefﬁcient of
5.7  108 m2. s1. This is two orders of magnitude lower than the
bulk diffusion coefﬁcient of oxygen (2.78  106 cm2s1 in 0.1 M
LITFSI/DME).
Alternatively, 
the 
contribution 
of 
ﬁlm 
diffusion 
can 
be
evaluated using the disk to ring transient time. The transient
time is related to the reactant diffusion coefﬁcient as follows [37]:

ð5Þ
K is a RRDE geometry dependent proportionality factor given by
K ¼ 43:12 log

2
3. This equation for K is applicable when the
transient time is measured in seconds and the rotation rate is in
rpm. In the present case, it is 10.1 rpm.s, leading to a calculated
value 
of 
the 
transient 
time 
at 
400 rpm 
of 
0.3s. 
Whereas
experimentally, we observe a transient time of 14s. While there
may be a contribution from the difference between the calculated
and actual K values (due to variations in RRDE geometry), these
would not be sufﬁcient to explain the two orders of magnitude
variation between the predicted and measured transient times(the
experimentally determined value of K in reference 37 was 11). But
since the ﬁlm and bulk diffusion coefﬁcients vary signiﬁcantly, the
possible reason for this discrepancy is apparent. The slow product
diffusion through the ﬁlm on the disk slows down its detection at
the ring. Thus, analysis of both the reaction currents at the disk and
product oxidation currents at the ring show that transport through
the ﬁlm plays a major role in determining the reaction site (ﬁlm
surface vs. ﬁlm pores) and rate of product transport through the
ﬁlm (Li2O2 precipitation vs. pore clogging). This is a vital ﬁrst step
in understanding the Li+ ORR in practical electrodes.
The Koutecky-Levich plots were used to calculate the total
number of electrons transferred in the reaction and this was found
to equal 1.07 within 10% error. This calculation was carried out
using the geometric surface area of the electrode. The actual
surface area measured by techniques such as N2 adsorption (BET) is
not applicable herein as the electroactive surface area is not
necessarily the same as the physical surface area. The variation of
ORR kinetics by adsorption site has been discussed by us elsewhere
[20]. Further, the bulk diffusion coefﬁcient of oxygen was used as
the effective diffusion coefﬁcient.
The combination of the total number of electrons with the
information on the rate determining step obtained from a Tafel plot
allowed us to describe the overall electrochemistry of the present
system. Semilog plots of kinetic current and the disk potential
(Tafel plot) are depicted in Fig. 4. The kinetic current and the
potential are related by the Tafel equation:
h ¼ a þ b:log ik
ð Þ 
ð6Þ
Where
a ¼ 2:3RT
a:F :logi0
ð7Þ
b ¼ 2:3RT
a:F
ð8Þ
The kinetic current ik is determined by a rearrangement of the
Koutecky-Levich equation (ik ¼ i:iL= iL  i
ð 
Þ) to obtain a relationship
between the disk current and the limiting current. The slope of this
plot indicates the rate determining step. In the present case, a value
of 390 mV dec1 was obtained which was found to be at odds with
the theoretical value (118 mV dec1 with transfer coefﬁcient
(a) = 0.5) for the ﬁrst electron transfer step being rate determining.
This anomalous value of the Tafel slope points to a deviation in the
value of the transfer coefﬁcient from the conventional value of 0.5
due to an asymmetric energy landscape for the anodic and
cathodic directions of the ORR caused by solvent interactions as
described by us elsewhere [22].
To calculate the individual reaction rate constants for the
elementary steps, multiple possible Li-O2 ORR pathways depicted
in Fig. 5 were considered. The initial step consists of the adsorption
of O2 on the cathode surface and subsequent production of LiO2.
Following the production of LiO2, various possible reduction
pathways were considered  further electrochemical reduction to
produce Li2O2, chemical disproportionation reaction on the surface
between adjacent LiO2 to produce Li2O2 and desorption followed
by chemical disproportionation to produce Li2O2 in the electrolyte.

573However, the four-electron reaction to produce Li2O was not
considered in this reaction scheme due to lack of experimental
reports of Li2O as the reduction product. The effect of water on the
reaction was a key consideration. It has been reported that the
surface or the solution phase reaction dominates depending on the
water content [46]. The present model considers both surface and
solution mechanisms and hence this variability is implicitly
accounted for. Further, the amount of water initially present in
the electrolyte (76.8 ppm) is in between the limits for transition
between a largely surface based (<30 ppm) to a largely solution
based mechanism (>2000 ppm). Hence a model based on
competitive solution and surface based mechanisms would be
most representative of the present system. Efforts to explicitly
incorporate side reactions with water, its possible catalytic activity
and its effects on the nucleation of Li2O2 are ongoing.
The reactions were described by typical kinetic equations along
with equations for the disk and ring currents. The equations are as

The kinetic relations were simpliﬁed based on our experimental
observations. The Koutecky-Levich plots indicated that the overall
reaction involved the transfer of a single electron. Thus, the direct
two-electron and series based two-electron pathway to produce
Li2O2 was eliminated (k2 = k3 = 0). The simpliﬁed model was further
analyzed to obtain individual reaction rate constants.
Fig. 6 shows the distribution of disk and ring current (N(iD/iR) vs.
square root of the rotation rate (v1/2). This plot is expected to
yield straight lines with different slopes (S) and intercepts (J) at
different potentials based on the simpliﬁed form of Eq. (14) where
A = 1. The slopes (S) and intercepts (J) at different potentials from
Fig. 6 were plotted in Fig. 7. The slope and intercept are related by
the following equation:

Fig. 7 was seen to follow the prediction from the model that the

the rate constant for the electrolyte bulk disproportionation
reaction (k6). The rate constant for desorption of LiO2 from the
surface (k5) was then calculated from the slopes of the N

The value of k5 was found to be smaller by three orders of
magnitude as compared to the values on a smooth, planar GC disk

J. Seo et al. / Electrochimica Acta 248 (2017) 570–577[22]. The rate of desorption was understood to be a function of the
convective transport from the ﬁlm surface reaction sites and
diffusive (Fickian and/or Knudsen) transport from the intra-pore
reaction sites. The material dependent intermediate binding
energy could also play a role. The carbonaceous nature of the
electrode in both the smooth and porous cases and the equal rates
of rotation indicated that the variation in the desorption rates was
a function of the porosity of the electrode. At the same rotation
rates (i.e. equal rates of convection), the smooth electrode would
display purely Fickian diffusion whereas the porous electrodes can
be expected to display a mixture of Fickian and Knudsen behavior
(which is typically slower) depending on pore size distribution.
Further, desorption would also depend on the species concentra-
tion gradient between the surface and the near surface electrolyte
environment. This gradient could be non-uniform in highly
tortuous electrodes and hence result in non-uniform mass
transport driving forces leading to a net slower rate of desorption.
This was reﬂected in the large time transient between the
observation of the mass transport limited current at the disk
and the appearance of the corresponding current plateau at the
ring.
The rate constant for the ﬁrst electron transfer (k1) was
calculated from the rotation dependent relation between iD, iL
described by Eq. (17) and depicted in Fig. 8. The close match
between the theoretical and experimental intercepts served as
further validation of the present model.

The potential dependence of the various rate constants are
summarized in Fig. 9 and compared with the values for the
smooth GC disk case from Sankarasubramanian et al. [22]. The
potential dependent rate constant for the electrochemical one-
electron transfer reaction (k1) for both porous CB and smooth GC
disk showed similar values as expected for electrochemically
similar carbonaceous surfaces. This clearly indicated that any
observed variation in the Li-O2 cathode reactions with changes in
electrode porosity is physical in origin and not electrochemical.
The rate constants for the chemical disproportionation reaction in
the bulk (k6) was found to be similar for both electrodes since the
reactions in the electrolyte are independent of the physical or
chemical properties of the electrode. The non-electrochemical
steps – chemical disproportionation on the surface and desorption
of LiO2 and their associated rate constants k4 and k5 were found to
display no potential dependence as expected. The value of k4 was
found to slightly increase with potential in the case of the porous
CB disk. This was understood to occur due to a combination of the
increasing production of LiO2 at higher potentials and the
hindered desorption of the LiO2 due to the porous nature of the

575disproportionation reaction requires the presence of two LiO2
species in proximity and the occurrence of this increases with
increasing concentration of the superoxide. While on the smooth
electrode this increase in concentration can be expected to result
in a proportionate increase in the rate of desorption, this would
not be the case on the porous electrode as the effective rate of pore
transport was found to be two orders pf magnitude lower than the
rate of bulk transport. Thus, the smooth GC electrode showed a
slight decrease in the rate of surface disproportionation with
potential while the porous electrode was found to display the
opposite behavior.
Thus, the porous electrode increases the retention of the
product species on the electrode and hence offers a possible
avenue towards greater reversibility of Li2O2, with the trade-off
being the overall slower rate of reaction due to the slowdown in the
rate of the chemical disproportionation reaction on the surface.
Further, the chemical disproportionation reaction on the surface is
expected to dominate due to the transport properties of a porous
electrode.
4. Conclusion
The present study examines the effect of porosity on the
individual reactions comprising the ORR in Li-O2 systems. Porous
carbon was chosen as being representative of the typical electrode
and catalyst support used in practical Li-O2 cells. The porosity of
the electrode was found to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
desorption of reaction intermediates and their further reaction on
the surface while having minimal effect on the electrochemical
reaction or chemical reactions in the electrolyte bulk. Porous
electrodes offer a way to increase reversibility of the Li-O2 cell by
minimizing loss of the Li2O2 product by precipitation but would
also be hampered by increased passivation. The present study is
expected to inform the choice of porous materials as non-aqueous
cathodes and possibly inﬂuence the tailoring of optimum electrode
porosity and tortuosity.
