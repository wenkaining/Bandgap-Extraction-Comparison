Abstract
Lead-halide perovskites have demonstrated astonishing increases in power conversion efﬁciency
in photovoltaics over the last decade. The most efﬁcient perovskite devices now outperform
industry-standard multi-crystalline silicon solar cells, despite the fact that perovskites are
typically grown at low temperature using simple solution-based methods. However, the toxicity
of lead and its ready solubility in water are concerns for widespread implementation. These
challenges, alongside the many successes of the perovskites, have motivated signiﬁcant efforts
across multiple disciplines to ﬁnd lead-free and stable alternatives which could mimic the ability
of the perovskites to achieve high performance with low temperature, facile fabrication methods.
This Review discusses the computational and experimental approaches that have been taken to
discover lead-free perovskite-inspired materials, and the recent successes and challenges in
synthesizing these compounds. The atomistic origins of the extraordinary performance exhibited
by lead-halide perovskites in photovoltaic devices is discussed, alongside the key challenges in
engineering such high-performance in alternative, next-generation materials. Beyond
photovoltaics, this Review discusses the impact perovskite-inspired materials have had in
spurring efforts to apply new materials in other optoelectronic applications, namely light-
emitting diodes, photocatalysts, radiation detectors, thin ﬁlm transistors and memristors. Finally,
the prospects and key challenges faced by the ﬁeld in advancing the development of perovskite-
inspired materials towards realization in commercial devices is discussed.

1. Introduction
Sunlight is a vast, reliable and ubiquitous source of renewable
energy [1]. Each year, terrestrial solar energy amounts to
1500 exawatt-hours [2], whereas global electrical energy
demand was only 0.03 exawatt-hours in 2018. Arguably the
most promising method to convert solar energy to electricity
with no carbon-based by-products is through photovoltaics
(PVs) [1]. However, solar energy production only reached
440 terawatt-hours in 2018, with 500 gigawatts of PV capa-
city installed worldwide by the end of 2018 [1]. Although PV
deployment is projected to soon reach the terawatt level [1], it
is predicted that 37–180 TW of PV capacity would be needed
by 2050 in order to fulﬁl the ambitions of over 60 nations to
achieve net-zero carbon emissions [3].
Numerous technoeconomic analyses have examined the
challenges that must be addressed to enable the required
scaling of PV capacity, some of which are covered in [1, 3, 4].
Notably, this will require reductions in the levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE) and capital-intensity of manufacturing [4],
which could be achieved through the use of thin ﬁlm solar
cells, particularly in tandem devices. Tandem solar cells
combine two sub-cells which absorb in complementary parts
of the solar spectrum, thus surpassing the theoretical limit of a
single-junction device. Thin ﬁlm solar cells are also suitable
for integration in buildings (e.g. solar windows), or use
indoors to power small standalone gadgets, forming part of
the Internet of Things [5].
While thin ﬁlm PVs have been developed for decades,
lead-halide
perovskites
(LHPs)
have
recently
emerged,
demonstrating higher device learning-rates than any other PV
material [5]. Since their ﬁrst report in PVs in 2009 (with 3.8%
efﬁciency [6]), LHP PVs have now reached a certiﬁed efﬁ-
ciency of 25.5% (as of the end of 2020) [7] for small area
cells, exceeding the efﬁciency of multi-crystalline silicon and
approaching the certiﬁed record efﬁciency of crystalline sili-
con solar cells (26.7% [7]). Tandems between LHP top-cells
and silicon bottom-cells have already reached a certiﬁed
efﬁciency of 29.15% after only 6 years of development [8, 9].
The LHP band gap can be easily tuned over a wide range
through manipulation of the composition. As a result, per-
ovskite-perovskite tandems have been realized, with 25%
efﬁciency already achieved [10]. Both tandem structures are
projected to achieve lower LCOEs than single-junction sili-
con solar cells [5]. Single-junction perovskite devices have
also demonstrated 35.2% efﬁciency under indoor lighting
[11]. Critically, these high efﬁciencies can be achieved
through low-temperature
and facile processing, namely
solution-processing and thermal evaporation. LHPs therefore
hold signiﬁcant potential for reducing the LCOE and capital-
intensity of PVs.
However, there remains debate over whether the toxicity
of lead (present in a soluble form in LHPs) could present a
barrier to terawatt-scale deployment [12]. In addition, most
LHPs are unstable in ambient air. While there has been sig-
niﬁcant effort to address this, with encapsulated perovskite
solar cells now having met industry stability protocols (IEC
61215-1-3:2016) [13], LHPs used on the utility scale would
ultimately need to have a ﬁeld stability exceeding 25 years.
More broadly, the success of LHPs deﬁes conventional wis-
dom regarding the role of defects, in which high efﬁciencies
are achieved despite thin ﬁlms exhibiting large defect con-
centrations, several orders of magnitude greater than in tra-
ditional silicon or gallium arsenide materials [14]. This
prompts the question of how such tolerance to defects arises,
and whether this property could be generalized and designed
in other classes of materials, especially those composed of
abundant, non-toxic elements, and which are stable in air.
Broadly, three strategies have been used to identify
perovskite-inspired materials (PIMs): (1) searching for che-
mically-analogous materials, (2) investigating materials with
a perovskite crystal structure, and (3) inverse design of
materials based on defect tolerance [15–18]. This effort spans
across multiple academic disciplines. The key questions focus
not only on structure-mechanism-property relationships of the
materials and their performance in devices, but also how
computational tools are being developed to accelerate the
design and discovery of novel materials for high-performance
optoelectronic devices.
In this Topical Review, we bring computational and
theoretical research together with experimental efforts to
engineer the properties and performance of these materials
(ﬁgure 1). Our Review begins with a discussion of the high-
throughput materials discovery process, alongside the chal-
lenges of this research method. Following this, the chemical
origins of defect tolerance are explored in detail, before
relating these properties to the remarkable photovoltaic per-
formance of LHPs and the inverse design of advanced per-
ovskite-inspired materials (PIMs) that may also achieve
defect tolerance. Additionally, a brief introduction to the
practical implementation, challenges and frontiers of com-
putational defect investigations is provided. We next discuss
the classes of materials that have been considered, their
properties, and synthesis methods developed. This is followed
by a discussion on the performance of these materials in
photovoltaic devices, as well as the opportunities found in
using the materials for alternative applications (including
light-emitting diodes and radiation detectors). Finally, we
discuss the key frontiers and challenges in discovering high-
performance PIMs, and the important questions that urgently
need to be answered in order to achieve commercial
application.

Topical Review2. Computational and theoretical approaches to
accelerate the discovery of perovskite-inspired
materials
2.1. Computational materials discovery
Materials modelling is a rapidly expanding scientiﬁc ﬁeld, most
notably in the realm of materials discovery and design, where
computational methods have signiﬁcantly accelerated research
efforts [29]. While computational materials science has ﬂour-
ished as a fertile research ﬁeld since the 1970s, with a rich
history of Nobel laureates, rapid technological advancements
alongside ﬁnancial investment have supported a renaissance in
this area in recent times. Long-established approximations are
no longer necessary and simulation size/time constraints can be
overcome, providing the capability to perform increasingly
quantitative and realistic calculations. Historically, computer
simulations have played a responsive, augmentative role in
relation to experiment. However, these recent advances have
facilitated the ability of computational predictions to guide
experiment, representing a critical component in the efﬁcient
discovery of novel high-performance materials.
The fundamental challenge of materials discovery is to
identify
promising
candidate
materials
(for
the
speciﬁed
application) from the near-inﬁnite chemical space of possible
compounds. To illustrate the scale of this physical search space,
one can simply look at the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database
(ICSD; icsd.cds.rsc.org), which contains over 150 000 entries for
unique materials. Taking a more fundamental combinatorial
approach, the number of possible two-, three- and four-element
combinations, each with speciﬁc oxidation states and stoichio-
metries, in fact exceeds the trillions (1012 possibilities). This
indicates the presence of a vast unexplored compositional space,
which may very well contain hidden ‘wonder materials’, patiently
waiting for the opportunity to revolutionize modern technologies.
The exploration of such a broad physical space is evi-
dently intractable to experiment or ab-initio calculations.
However, high-throughput screening procedures involving a
tiered, ‘funnel’ approach (as depicted schematically in
ﬁgure 2) offer a promising pathway to efﬁciently probe this
raw chemical landscape.
2.1.1. Reducing the search space.
The ﬁrst step in a materials
discovery process is to apply certain universal constraints to
immediately ﬁlter out unrealistic and irrelevant candidates. It is
common practice to restrict the search space to speciﬁc material
classes (compositions, structures, symmetries, motifs, etc) such
as, inter alia, layered compounds, perovskite structures or

Topical Reviewmetal-organic frameworks, based on the intended application
and chemical intuition. A pragmatic choice is to further restrict
the search to abundant non-toxic elements, which are suitable
candidates for wide-scale deployment in devices. Moreover,
application of inexpensive charge neutrality, valency and
electronegativity ﬁlters to remove chemically-implausible
materials can reduce the combinatorial search space by two
orders of magnitude [30].
A prerequisite for a viable candidate material is that it be
synthesizable and (meta-)stable. Hence, this constraint is
commonly applied at an early stage of the screening process,
before any predictions of material properties and/or perfor-
mance metrics are made. For instance, in a search for
photoelectrochemically-active semiconductors, Davies et al
employed Shannon ionic radii and Goldschmidt tolerance
factors
to
predict
the
stability
of
inorganic
elemental
combinations
in the
cubic or orthorhombic
perovskite
structure, reducing their input dataset from 176 851 to
26 567 possible candidates [30].
2.1.2. Electronic structure theory.
After reducing the material
search space to a computationally-tractable subset, electronic
structure techniques may be invoked to apply a more rigorous
evaluation
of
the
remaining
candidate
materials.
A
widespread choice is Density Functional Theory (DFT), due
to its well-established accuracy (in predicting ground-state
structures and formation energies) at relatively moderate
computational cost. From high-throughput DFT calculations,
theoretical predictions of relevant material properties and
structure are performed, alongside validation of stability/
synthesizability. While certain higher levels of theory, such as
the inclusion of many-body effects within the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA), yield improved predictions for the
ground-state structural polymorphs of materials (relative to
semi-local DFT) [17], the computational expense of such
approaches
typically
render
them
infeasible
for
high-
throughput
investigations,
for
which
speed
must
be
prioritized
over
accuracy.
This
becomes
increasingly
apparent when one considers the success of semi-local DFT
in predicting ground-state structures of typical chemical
compounds, with only a handful of speciﬁc material classes
requiring higher levels of theory.
Within DFT, there remains the choice of the vital
ingredient:
the
exchange-correlation
functional,
which
describes the quantum mechanical electron–electron interac-
tions. Two common forms are the Local Density Approx-
imation (LDA) and the Generalized Gradient Approximations
(GGA). Decades of practical experience have revealed clear
favorites for various material types or structural motifs, such
as PBEsol (GGA) for standard inorganic solid compounds
[31], DFT+U for materials with magnetic interactions or
localized d orbitals [32], and dispersion-corrected functionals
such as optB86b-vdW or Grimme’s D3 for layered structures
[33–35].
Databases of material simulations, such as the Materials
Project (materialsproject.org), NOMAD repository (nomad-
repository.eu) or MatNavi (mits.nims.go.jp), can often be of
beneﬁt in accelerating these initial screening steps and
reducing the computational demand by providing calculated
material structures and properties (e.g. formation energy).
However,
care
must
be
exercised
in
these
cases,
as
standardized calculation parameters (e.g. the choice of
exchange-correlation functional) may not be suitable for
certain material classes (e.g. layered compounds with van der
Waals interactions). Thus, knowledge and experience of
material simulations is required to judge the applicability of
database information for a given screening investigation.
2.1.3.
Chemical
descriptors.
At
this
point,
the
use
of
appropriate,
well-informed,
application-speciﬁc
chemical
descriptors is crucial in aiding both the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy
of the materials discovery process. In particular, these descriptors
should be both central to performance and accessible by
calculation. In the case of next-generation PV absorbers,
relevant material properties would include the magnitude and
nature (direct or indirect) of the electronic band gap E ,
g charge-
carrier mobilities
/
m
,
e h minority-carrier lifetimes
/
t
,
e h absorption
coefﬁcient a and the photoluminescence quantum efﬁciency
(PLQE) h [36]. These are summarized in table 1. Recently,
chemical descriptors of carrier effective mass, static polaron
binding energy and Fröhlich electron–phonon coupling were
used to predict 10 candidate p-type metal oxides [37]. These
properties can be measured or predicted through various

Topical Reviewexperimental or theoretical techniques, each with an associated
cost,
researcher-effort
and
accuracy.
Judicious
choice
of
appropriate descriptors is thus vital to the success of the
screening procedure in accurately and efﬁciently determining
potential candidate materials for the application in question.
Crucially, the level of theory, and hence computational
overhead, required for sufﬁciently-accurate calculations can
vary depending on both the property and material in question.
For instance, standard DFT functionals exhibit a systematic
underestimation of electronic band gaps in insulating crystals,
as a consequence of the ‘derivative-discontinuity’ and self-
interaction errors [29, 38]. Consequently, expensive techni-
ques, viz. hybrid non-local DFT or many-body GW theory are
necessary for the accurate determination of certain electronic
properties, such as the band gap and optical absorption. At
present, these costly methods are not readily applicable to
high-throughput studies of large material datasets, despite
recent advances in computational power. On the other hand,
relatively-cheap standard DFT methods (such as LDA/GGA)
are capable of accurately predicting the shape of electronic
bands and thus determining related descriptors such as the
charge carrier effective masses and mobilities [29].
In many cases, while the electronic band gap may be the
more fundamental, performance-deﬁning property (in relation
to the speciﬁc application of e.g. a battery electrode material),
it may be more prudent to use standard DFT methods to
calculate other relevant descriptors ﬁrst (e.g. carrier mobility),
ruling out any inappropriate candidates before implementing
higher-order, expensive techniques. In this manner, the most
burdensome procedures, both in terms of computational
demand and researcher effort, are restricted to only the most
promising of candidates.
The presence of heavy elements is another case for which
more sophisticated treatments are required, necessitating the
description of relativistic effects. In particular, spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) effects scale approximately with the square
of the atomic mass, and so these contributions become
increasingly signiﬁcant as one moves down the periodic table
[17]. Further down the line, proper accounting of non-radiative
recombination for the determination of charge-carrier lifetimes
and non-ideal quantum luminescence efﬁciencies requires
explicit defect calculations. As discussed in further detail in
section 2.3, these investigations demand substantial researcher
effort and computational overhead, due to the number of

Topical Reviewdistinct calculations involved and the mandatory use of large
simulation supercells.
After calculating the chosen descriptors for the material
dataset, pre-determined selection criteria are applied so that only
those materials with appropriate values for each property are
considered. These candidate materials which successfully emerge
from the chemical-descriptor screening stage should themselves
be diligently analyzed in terms of crystal structure and chemical
bonding. If similar characteristics evolve independently across
multiple systems, design principles may be elucidated to
accelerate
materials
discovery
efforts
and
guide
future
investigations.
2.1.4. Performance metrics and figures of merit.
Finally, a
ﬁgure of merit or ‘selection metric’ is typically determined for
each of the remaining candidates, such as the popular zT for
thermoelectrics, yielding a ﬁnal prediction of their potential
success in the designated application. The ultimate purpose of
the high-throughput materials discovery process is to identify
promising candidates from vast input chemical space, based
on the limited information available with ﬁnite resources (of
time and CPU power). Accordingly, intelligent choice of
selection metric is imperative to the success of these
preliminary investigations.
For PV, there is still ongoing work in this regard, and
several potential ﬁgures of merit have been put forward, as
discussed below.
SQ Limit: In 1961, Shockley and Queisser derived the
band gap-dependent radiative efﬁciency limit of a photo-
voltaic absorber (‘SQ Limit’), using the principle of detailed
balance [40]. This represented a tremendously signiﬁcant
development in the ﬁeld of PV research, enabling predictions
of maximum absorber performance, solely on the basis of the
fundamental electronic band gap.
However, a number of large approximations are invoked in
the SQ model, such as the assumption of perfect step-function
absorption above the band gap Eg and neglect of non-radiative
recombination (i.e.ﬁnite charge-carrier lifetimes) and material
thickness. Consequently, several models have since been
developed which go beyond the ideal SQ radiative efﬁciency
limit [36, 41]. With each additional level of detail and complexity
in these models, the predicted maximum efﬁciency decreases
marginally from the SQ value, approaching a reasonable upper
limit to the PV efﬁciency of a real-world device.
SLME: One extension was the ‘spectroscopic limited
maximum efﬁciency’ (SLME) proposed by Yu and Zunger [41],
which has seen considerable use in the literature since its
introduction in 2012 [42, 43]. The SLME extends the SQ model
to include the thickness and real, non-ideal absorbance of
materials. Additionally, the SLME has the capacity to account for
ﬁnite charge-carrier lifetimes, through speciﬁcation of the internal
quantum luminescence efﬁciency Q
,
lum, int though this requires
prior knowledge of the rate of non-radiative recombination.
Blank et al: In 2017, Blank et alwent a step further by
describing the solar material using bulk properties, namely the
refractive index and external (rather than internal) quantum
luminescence yield Q
,
lum,ext thereby including the effects of
light outcoupling and photon recycling [36]. The authors
applied this metric to a range of emerging thin-ﬁlm PV
materials,
including
CZTS
(Cu2ZnSnS4),
CuSbSe2
and
Sb2Se3, ﬁnding that CuSbSe2 exhibits the highest efﬁciency
for ideal quantum luminescence efﬁciencies (
=
Q
1
lum,ext
),
but that CZTS takes the lead at more realistic values
(
<
-
Q
10
lum,ext
2). At present, this method entails a certain
degree of manual calculation analysis, and so the develop-
ment of a user-friendly open-source package to automate and
streamline the process would substantially aid both the
popularity of this performance metric and its applicability to
high-throughput screening investigations.
TLC: In 2020, Kim et aldeveloped a ‘trap-limited
conversion’ efﬁciency (TLC) model to explicitly incorporate
equilibrium populations of native defects, their carrier-capture
coefﬁcients, and the associated non-radiative recombination
rates (ﬁgure 3) [44]. The TLC model relies on Shockley–
Read–Hall (SRH) recombination statistics and the principle of
detailed balance. Such an approach can provide a ‘gold
standard’ of maximum efﬁciency prediction for assessing
candidate PV absorber materials. However, it also entails
signiﬁcant computational expense, and so it is only applied to
the most promising materials.
For example, the TLC model was recently applied to the
kesterite family of quaternary thin-ﬁlm photovoltaic materi-
als, including CZTS, AZTSe (Ag2ZnSnSe4) and others,
revealing intrinsic defect-limited maximum efﬁciencies in
the range of 20%. In this case, the primary culprits are native
tin-based defects, in particular the tin-on-zinc antisite SnZn.
These defects produce electronic states deep in the band gap,
which act as ‘killer’ recombination centers, severely reducing
charge-carrier lifetimes (as further discussed in section 2.2.1).
This work offered valuable insight regarding the physical
origins of poor experimentally-observed PV performance of
these materials, which despite years of intense research and
SQ radiative limits of ~33% [45], have as-yet failed to exceed
power-conversion efﬁciencies of 12% [46].
In light of the fact that the efﬁciencies of actual PV
devices are in most cases limited by non-radiative recombina-
tion (the effects of which are illustrated in ﬁgure 4) [47, 48], it
is imperative that this loss mechanism is treated in ﬁrst-
principles investigations of PV performance. Indeed, cham-
pion materials from each respective generation of solar
absorbers (c-Si, CdTe, MAPbI3) demonstrate slow non-
radiative electron–hole recombination kinetics which, in
combination with large PLQE η and small Urbach tails,
affords solar energy conversion efﬁciencies close to their
radiative limits [49]. Extending the scope of materials
discovery
procedures
to
include
these
defect-governed
properties will lead to improved predictions of successful
next-generation photovoltaic materials.
2.2. Perovskite-inspired design principles and defect tolerance
Following the impressive optoelectronic performance of
LHPs, recent efforts in the ﬁeld have focused on leveraging
theory to understand the physical properties underpinning
their success [17]. From these chemical insights, design rules

Topical Reviewand screening criteria may be developed to guide the search
for high-performance ‘perovskite-inspired materials’ (PIMs).
Undoubtedly, a deﬁning feature of lead-halide per-
ovskites (LHPs) is a remarkable tolerance to non-stoichio-
metry and crystalline defects, which facilitates their high PV
efﬁciencies despite low-cost, solution-based synthesis routes.
While deliberate implementation of defects plays an essential
role in many relevant technological applications, such as
topological insulators, quantum materials and, of course,
doped semiconductors [50], the unintentional presence of
defects can often trigger serious degradation in device per-
formance [44]. In fact, as previously mentioned, provided the
electronic band gap is in the appropriate range for an efﬁcient
PV material (∼0.8 to 1.8 eV) [40], the most common per-
formance-limiting factor for new absorbers is non-radiative
recombination [47, 48]. By reducing the minority charge-
carrier lifetime, non-radiative recombination impedes the
collection of photo-generated carriers at the device terminals,
thereby decreasing the open-circuit voltage.
We deﬁne defect tolerance as the tendency of a material
to exhibit long minority carrier lifetimes (due to slow elec-
tron–hole recombination kinetics) despite the presence of
crystallographic defects. This phenomenon has been deﬁni-
tively identiﬁed as a crucial factor in the success of LHPs
[18, 50]. Many high-efﬁciency systems, such as single-crystal
GaAs, are known to be extremely intolerant to the presence of
point defects, necessitating a series of sophisticated and
expensive procedures (in a clean room, or at high temper-
ature) to fabricate pristine crystals for efﬁcient PV devices. In
contrast, perovskite solar cells may be synthesized via solu-
tion-based processing in normal laboratory environments at
lower temperatures, which are typically up to only 100 °C.
Nevertheless, LHPs manage to exhibit remarkably long

2.2.1. SRH theory of non-radiative recombination.
From SRH
theory, it is predicted that traps most likely to facilitate non-
radiative recombination are those near the center of the
electronic band gap [51]. Within this model, carrier-capture
rates
decrease
exponentially
with
increasing
energy
separation between the defect transition level and the
respective band-edge (i.e. the ‘depth’ of the defect level).
Electron–hole recombination is a two-(quasi)particle process,
and so a defect must sequentially capture both an electron and
a hole for non-radiative recombination to occur, as depicted in
ﬁgure 5. The total recombination rate is limited by the slower
of the two capture processes. Thus, the closer a defect level is
to the mid-gap region, the more rapid the recombination
kinetics expected for an intrinsic semiconductor. Beyond the
depth of the trap levels, there are several other important
factors that contribute to the recombination activity of a
particular defect (vide section 2.3), including the accessible
charge states, concentration, and capture coefﬁcient.
Shallow and deep defect states
Point defects are typically classiﬁed as ‘shallow’ or ‘deep’
according to a variety of criteria, such as the localization of the
donor/acceptor wavefunction [52], the relative magnitudes of
the carrier capture and emission coefﬁcients [53], or, most
commonly, the energetic position(s) of the defect charge
transition level(s) in the band gap [18, 44, 50]. Deep defects
typically exhibit localized electronic wavefunctions and charge
transition levels ‘deep’ within the band gap. Shallow defect
states, on the other hand, produce delocalized wavefunctions
with charge transition levels near or within the continuum
electron bands, thereby remaining innocuous with respect to
carrier lifetimes and PV performance.
2.2.2. What makes a material defect tolerant?
2.2.2.1. Orbital character
In an elemental semiconductor
such as Si, there is a bonding valence band maximum (VBM)
and an anti-bonding conduction band minimum (CBM), as
depicted in ﬁgure 6(a). A point defect, such as a vacancy, can
therefore produce non-bonding states at the center of the band
gap. Initially, defect tolerance was attributed to a change in
the bonding character of the band-edges [50, 54]. This
concept posited that the formation of shallow traps would be
favored if the VBM originated from anti-bonding interactions
and the CBM from bonding interactions. Non-bonding defect
states would therefore fall in the valence or conduction band
continua, rather than the band gap. This type of bonding is
often associated with the presence of d10 cations (e.g. Cu+),
and has been, for example, observed in Cu3N [55]. In Cu3N,
p-d orbital repulsion (due to the presence of ﬁlled Cu 3d
states) produces anti-bonding character at the VBM, with
similar interactions leading to a bonding-type CBM.
Analogously, a similar phenomenon has been observed
for LHPs, in which orbital repulsion between the halide anion
p states and cation s 2 lone-pair acts as the source of anti-
bonding interactions at the valence band-edge. However, in
LHPs, the hybridization of the Pb 6p and anion p orbitals
results in the formation of an anti-bonding state forming at the
CBM (as opposed to the bonding-character CBM of Cu3N),
with the bonding orbital forming within the valence band
[18]. This orbital arrangement is illustrated in ﬁgure 6(b), and
is conducive to shallow defect formation because the original
atomic orbitals (from which non-bonding defect states arise)
are close to the band-edges or within the continuum bands,
rather than deep within the band gap (ﬁgure 6).
A similar ‘defect-tolerant’ electronic structure can occur
in the case of substantial band-edge splitting and dispersion,
whether by spin–orbit or crystal-ﬁeld effects. Through
shifting and broadening the continuum electronic bands, the
band-edges are pushed toward (if not beyond) the atomic
orbital energy levels, in a manner analogous to that depicted
in ﬁgure 6. Likewise, this situation promotes the formation of
shallow defect states.

Charge-carriers may be

exponentially dependent on the energy separation between trap level
and band-edge.

Topical Reviewor short-range (orbital overlap and hybridization) potentials,
with the former dominating in ionic materials and the latter
more relevant for covalent compounds [56, 57]. In covalent
semiconductors, hybridization of dangling-bonds at a defect
center is thus a governing factor for the depth of the resultant
charge transition level [58–60], as alluded to in the original
defect tolerance concept above.
In the case of an anion vacancy, which is positively-
charged in the fully ionized state (e.g. VI
+ in CsPbI3), the
donor-type defect can trap a free electron by localizing it in
the unoccupied p orbitals of the surrounding cations. The
addition of an electron will cause these neighboring cations to
slightly contract, on account of Coulomb attraction, thereby
lowering the energy of the localized electron (due to increased
hybridization of the dangling p orbitals). The strength of this
electronic stabilization, relative to the strain energy from
nearby stretched bonds, determines the trapping energy of the
defect (i.e.depth of the defect transition level). If the orbital
hybridization is not sufﬁciently strong, this localized electro-
nic state will be unstable and the defect will instead adopt the
energetically-favored shallow hydrogenic donor state, with
the electron located at the defect-perturbed CBM.
The strength of this cation–cation interaction at the anion
vacancy site will be dependent on both the anion coordination
environment and the cation–cation distances, with low
coordination numbers and large inter-cationic distances
associated with weak hybridization and shallow defect levels.
Thus, the presence of large anions and bond lengths with low
anion coordination is predicted to aid defect tolerance,
particularly in the case of chalcogenides, halides and
chalcohalides, since anion vacancies are typically the primary
native donor defects in these materials [59, 60].
In [60], Kim et al provide an instructive example of this
behavior; employing an ‘inorganic frame model’ to decouple
the chemical and structural effects of halide substitution on
the anion-vacancy defect level for inorganic lead-halide
perovskites. They demonstrate that the halide vacancy (VX,
X=I, Br, Cl) transforms from a delocalized shallow state in
[PbI3]−and [PbBr3]−to a localized deep state in [PbCl3]−
(ﬁgure 7), as a result of lattice contraction (hence increased
hybridization) from the smaller anionic radius, alongside
band-shifting effects.
Analogous behavior could hypothetically occur for cation
vacancy sites, with the strength of anion-anion dangling bond
hybridization contributing to the depth of the acceptor defect
level. That said, to the knowledge of the authors, this
mechanism has not yet been ascribed to the formation of
shallow acceptor states in a defect tolerant material. One likely
reason for this is the fact that band-structure defect tolerance
effects (section 2.2.2.1) are not always independent of structural
effects. For instance, in the hypothetical cubic PbI2, tetrahedral
Pb coordination and shorter Pb–I distances strengthen the anti-
bonding orbital interaction at the VBM, yielding shallow cation
vacancies, as opposed to the deep states found in ground-state
layered PbI2 [61]. However, this coordination environment
implies greater dangling-bond hybridization, and deeper defect
states. The fact that, in this case, the energy upshift of the VBM
outweighs that of the dangling-bond defect states, results in
overall shallow cation vacancies.
In a similar manner, defect tolerance has been partially
ascribed to ionic bonding in certain perovskite materials
[57, 62, 63], with reduced covalency yielding lower energy
dangling bonds and hence shallower defect levels. However,
as mentioned earlier, long-range electrostatics may also
induce charge localization and hence deep defect formation
in heteropolar/ionic systems; the strength of this interaction
being mediated by the dielectric constant of the material [56].
Thus, one should be wary of suggesting decreased covalency
as an indication of potential defect tolerance in a candidate
material, as it is a delicate balance of several competing
effects (ion coordination, bond length, hybridization, bonding
character, crystal symmetry, oxidation state, Jahn–Teller
distortion, etc), which ultimately determine the energetic
position of the defect charge transition level.
These points serve to highlight the intricacy of the
physics governing the defect wavefunction, which must be
carefully maneuvered when attempting to construct robust
defect tolerance design principles.
2.2.2.3. Defect-carrier Coulomb interactions.
An electron or
hole in a semiconducting material may be attracted or repelled
from a charged point defect due to simple Coulomb
interactions, increasing or decreasing the carrier-trapping
rate relative to the neutral case. This electrostatic effect is
incorporated via the Sommerfeld enhancement factor á ñs ,
which for the attractive case is given by [64, 65]:

Depending on the dielectric and conductive properties of
the material, the Sommerfeld factor á ñs
can range from
anywhere between ∼0.1 and 20, therefore strongly inﬂuencing
electron–hole recombination kinetics and subsequent charge-
carrier lifetimes. From visual inspection of equation (1), it is
evident that several material properties can inﬂuence the
magnitude of this carrier-capture enhancement factor, thereby
contributing to the defect (in)tolerance of a material.
Enhanced dielectric screening: The dielectric constant
reﬂects the ability of a compound to screen an electrostatic
perturbation. Numerous material properties critical to the
physics of a PV device, such as the rates of carrier-capture
and ionized impurity scattering, the depth of shallow defect
levels and exciton binding energies, are dependent on the
dielectric constant [50]. For a given defect concentration, a
larger dielectric constant corresponds to stronger Coulombic

non-radiative recombination.
Oxidation states: The oxidation states of species in a
material determines the relative likelihood of different charge
states for a given defect [66]. For instance, in CdTe, cadmium
is formally in the +2 oxidation state, and so a cadmium
vacancy VCd can take on the neutral and −2 charge states;

relative to the neutral case (〈s〉∝|Q|). Thus, low oxidation-
state materials may be more likely to contain low-charge
defects with reduced carrier-trapping rates.

wavefunctions at defect sites can slow charge-carrier transport
and is associated with thermal losses. A small effective mass

Of
course, a small effective mass is also beneﬁcial for the carrier
mobility and electrical conductivity of the device, as well as
preventing the formation of small polarons [50].
2.2.2.4. Benign complex formation.
Another proposed technique
for the design of defect-tolerant materials is the passivation of
‘killer’ defect centers via the deliberate formation of benign
defect complexes [50, 63, 68]. In this case, defect-defect
interactions are leveraged to shift deep-levels closer to (or even
into) the continuum bands, ‘bleaching the gap’ of deleterious trap
states. The main adversary in this situation, however, is the
entropic cost associated with defect-complex formation, which
must be overcome either by an adequate enthalpy gain or the
creation of metastable arrangements via intelligent synthesis
strategies. Due to the inherent difﬁculty in engineering this state,
this strategy remains largely unexplored for the design of novel
defect tolerant materials.

Topical Reviewaccelerate the recombination kinetics as one might initially
expect, these extra levels often ‘self-inhibit’, reducing the
overall rate of recombination [69, 70]. In this situation, it is
likely that one of the defect levels is near a band-edge, far
from the gap center. Due to the exponential dependence of
charge-capture rate on the energetic separation of the defect
level and corresponding band-edge (i.e. the ‘depth’ of the
defect level), enormous imbalances in charge transition rates
can arise in this case, leading to defects becoming ‘stuck’ in
extreme charge states. Being near a continuum band, the near-
edge defect level efﬁciently captures and re-emits the
corresponding charge carrier (hole if near the VBM or
electron if near the CBM). However, as depicted in ﬁgure 8,
capture of the opposite charge carrier is exceptionally slow.
Consequently, the majority of defects adopt the extreme
charge
state,
exhibiting
sluggish
carrier
capture
and
recombination kinetics.
On the other hand, the highly recombination-active
charge states (which produce the mid-gap transition level)
have almost negligible concentration and thus minimal
overall recombination activity. Another way to conceptualize
this mechanism is to recall that the total recombination rate
for a given defect species is dictated by the slowest capture
process involved (section 2.2.1). Hence, the incredibly slow
capture rate of the extreme charge state introduces a
bottleneck in the recombination cycle, greatly diminishing
the overall recombination activity of the defect. Such
tolerance
can
similarly
occur
in
the
case
of
strong
anharmonicity, whereby transition rate imbalances are driven
by a lack of symmetry in potential energy surfaces and charge
capture barriers [70].
2.2.2.6.
Related

Crystal
structure: In any material, the crystal structure is a
governing
factor
in
the
resultant
electronic
structure.
Highly-symmetric crystal structures (viz. cubic phases such
as halites, CsCl-type structures and cubic perovskites) tend to
exhibit isotropic bonding and transport properties. Often, this
behavior produces a direct fundamental gap (though the
optical gap may still be indirect, due to strong selection rules)
and relatively disperse band extrema, resulting in low
effective masses [71, 72]. On the other hand, highly-
anisotropic compounds such as layered materials often
exhibit heavy effective masses and relatively ﬂat electronic
bands. More importantly, the crystal structure signiﬁcantly
inﬂuences the strength of both dangling-bond hybridization
(section
2.2.2.2)
and
orbital
repulsion
at
band-edges
(section 2.2.2.1).
Cation electronic conﬁguration: The electronic conﬁg-
uration of the cation is associated with a number of defect-
tolerant properties in a material. In halide perovskites, an
important case is the formation of the 6s2 lone pair
conﬁguration of Pb2+ in MAPbI3, which has a partially
oxidized valence electron shell relative to the fully-ionized
6s06p0 Pb4+ ion. The resulting large, polarizable cation
induces large Born effective charges (and thus a high
dielectric constant) alongside stronger SOC of the unoccupied
cation p states in the conduction band (hence increased band
dispersion, favoring shallow donor defects, and reduced
electron effective mass) [72, 73]. Moreover, ﬁlled s2 orbitals
can partially hybridize with the valence-band-dominated
anion p orbitals, introducing anti-bonding character in the
VBM (encouraging the formation of shallow acceptor
defects) and broadening the valence bandwidth (thus reducing
the hole effective mass).
This stable ‘N-2’ lone-pair oxidation state, and accom-
panying effects, is most commonly observed for the heavy
post-transition metals in the sixth row of the periodic table
(i.e.Tl+, Pb2+ and Bi3+), due to the relativistic contraction
(and consequent stabilization) of the valence s orbital
[74, 75]. Nonetheless, lighter cations (namely In+, Sn2+ and
Sb3+) may also adopt these oxidation states in PV materials
[72, 75, 76]. Moreover, strongly electronegative anions (F−,
Cl−, O2−etc) are more likely to fully oxidize the cations,
hence softer elements (S2−, Se2−, I−etc) are often required to
stabilize the cation lone-pair.
A salient point, regarding the valence band anion
p-cation s hybridization, is that the strength of this interaction
(hence degree of dispersion and anti-bonding character at the
band-edge) is dependent on the alignment and overlap of the
atomic orbitals. If the cation lone-pair is much deeper than the
higher-energy anion p orbitals, there will be minimal
interaction
between
these
states,
with
a
consequently
negligible contribution from the cation states to the band-
edge. Indeed, this has been observed for certain Bi3+ lone-
pair materials which were recently investigated as potential
solar absorbers, including BiI3 and Cs2AgBiBr6 [18, 42, 75].
This point provides an instructive example of the
speciﬁcity of certain defect tolerance mechanisms, which
unfortunately prevents the decoupling of elemental contribu-
tions to this phenomenon. Rather than simply searching for
materials with stable lone-pair cations, one must also consider
Figure 8. Energy level diagram of carrier capture and SRH
recombination at two defect levels in the band gap, demonstrating
‘self-inhibiting’ behavior. (More on charge transition levels in
section 2.3.3). Under the SRH model, the exponential dependence of
carrier capture rate Rn on the energy separation between trap level
and band-edge leads to a buildup of defects in the X+ state. This
defect charge state exhibits weak carrier capture kinetics, thus
suppressing non-radiative recombination.

2.2.3. Defect tolerance in lead halide perovskites.
There has
been much research on the atomistic origins of the strong
defect tolerance exhibited by lead-halide perovskites (LHPs)
[18, 50, 53, 60, 70–73, 77, 78]. Despite some disagreement in
the literature [70, 77, 78], likely due to the multi-faceted
origin of this phenomenon in LHPs, several material
properties
have
now
been
deﬁnitively
identiﬁed
to
contribute to the remarkable defect tolerance of these
materials.
2.2.3.1. Defect tolerant band structure.
Firstly, as depicted
for the valence band in ﬁgure 6, perovskites exhibit a unique
band structure in which interaction between the B-site cation
ns2 lone-pair and the anion p orbitals produces a dispersive,
anti-bonding VBM. As discussed above, this situation is
predicted to yield predominantly shallow acceptor-type
defects, such as cation vacancies, alongside small hole
effective masses and thus a decreased hole capture rate, per
(1) [18, 53, 72].
In addition, for a heavy cation, such as Pb2+ in MAPbI3,
strong SOC broadens the bandwidth of the CBM, reducing
the occurrence of deep donor defects in a similar manner to
the bonding-character CBM in ﬁgure 6. Greater conduction
band dispersion also lowers the electron effective mass, thus
decreasing the rate of electron trapping per (1).
2.2.3.2. Cationic lone pair.
The 6s2 electronic conﬁguration
of Pb2+ also aids defect tolerance in MAPbI3 through a
dramatic contribution to the dielectric properties of the
material [58]. Born effective charges, describing the ionic
polarizability, are enhanced by the presence of the Pb2+
cationic lone-pair. The resulting increase in mixed ionic-
covalent bonding character leads to a massively-increased
dielectric constant (εr>25), which is approximately three
times greater than that of other thin-ﬁlm solar absorbers, such
as CdTe and CZTS [50, 53, 73]. By effectively screening
charged defect centers and enhancing carrier mobility, the
highly-polarizable lone-pair emphatically suppresses non-
radiative
recombination
and
improves
photovoltaic
performance.
To illustrate the inﬂuence of a small effective mass m ,*
large permittivity εr and low absolute oxidation states (+1,
+2 and −1 respectively for the prototypical ABX3 perovs-
kite) on defect tolerance in LHPs, one can inspect the

defect in GaAs (e.g.

in [53].
2.2.3.3. Anion coordination environment.
Beyond the effects
of the valence s2 lone pair, the low coordination number (2) of
iodine, in conjunction with the expanded lattice constant from
the methylammonium A-site cation, gives rise to weak Pb–Pb
hybridization at the iodine anion vacancy center. This weak
interaction is insufﬁcient to create a deep bound state, further
aiding defect tolerance in this material [58, 59]. Despite the
presence of partial ionic character, long-range electrostatic
effects are also unable to localize charge in this case, due to
the small band gap and effective dielectric screening [56, 57].
The success of MAPbI3 in combining weak cation–cation
dangling-bond hybridization with a defect-tolerant electronic
structure (section 2.2.3.1) indicates that ternary or multinary
compounds may provide a fruitful search space for the
discovery of new defect-tolerant materials [61]. In particular,
materials which exhibit ‘pseudobinary’ behavior, containing a
spectator ion which does not contribute to the band-edge
states (see MA+ cation in MAPbI3), may be more likely to
simultaneously exhibit low ion coordination and orbital
repulsion at band-edges.
2.2.3.4. Inactive deep states.
On the other hand, the few
deep intrinsic defects that do still exist in LHPs, including
iodine antisites IPb and IMA, lead–iodine antisite PbI and
interstitial lead Pbi, have been shown to demonstrate weak
recombination activity [70, 79]. The physical reason behind
this inactivity has been debated. Initially, it was attributed to
large predicted formation enthalpies, which would result in
low concentrations with little to no adverse effect on carrier
lifetimes [18, 79].
Recently however, this ﬁnding has been challenged, with
‘self-inhibition’ (as a result of multiple intra-gap defect levels)
predicted to be the origin of slow recombination kinetics for
IPb and PbI antisites [70]. The authors suggest that both
anharmonic carrier-capture barriers and the presence of
additional near-edge defect levels introduce bottlenecks in
the non-radiative recombination cycle (vide section 2.2.2.5),
thereby rendering LHPs tolerant to these deep traps.
2.2.3.5. Low Schottky defect formation energies.
In addition,
theoretical and experimental investigations have found low
formation enthalpies of intrinsic Schottky-type defects (i.e.
cation
vacancy—anion
vacancy
complexes)
[63,
68],
suggesting high concentrations of benign defect complexes.
2.2.3.6. Self-healing.
Finally, the soft crystal framework and
relatively low melting temperature of LHPs points at the
possibility of appreciable ion diffusion and ‘self-healing’ of
defects at typical processing temperatures, resulting in fewer
recombination-active defect center [80, 81]. Moreover, this
leads to small phonon energies in MAPbI3, which also
contribute to a reduction in carrier capture rates [53, 82].
Evidently, the Pb2+ cation in lead-halide perovskites
plays a pivotal role in the exceptional optoelectronic proper-
ties of these materials. Through its effects on the electronic
band structure, dielectric screening and bonding behavior (as
discussed above), the ns2 cation contributes to an unfortu-
nately rare combination of defect tolerance characteristics.
This accomplishment has spurred extensive research efforts in
the ﬁeld of ‘perovskite-inspired materials’, which may be
12

Topical Reviewcapable of replicating the astonishing success of LHPs while
overcoming the barriers of toxicity and stability.
2.2.4. Target features for defect tolerance.
Through thorough
investigation and enhanced understanding of the physical
origins of defect tolerance in LHPs, it is hoped that general
design principles may be developed for ‘perovskite-inspired’
defect-tolerant materials.
Such target material features include: (i) band-edge
orbital repulsion (bonding character); (ii) large polarizable
cation(s) (aiding dielectric screening of charged defects, band
dispersion and anti-bonding valence band interactions—
assuming sufﬁcient spatial overlap and energetic alignment
with anionic states); (iii) low atomic coordination alongside
large ionic radii and lattice constants (reducing dangling-bond
hybridization); (iv) mixed ionic-covalent bonding character
(strengthening dielectric screening and suppressing dangling-
bond hybridization); (v) crystal anharmonicity and/or multi-
ple intra-gap defect levels (promoting ‘self-inhibition’); (vi)
low formation enthalpies for innocuous defect complexes;
and (vii) soft crystal framework (to allow ‘self-healing’).
There is a plethora of ongoing research focusing on the
implementation of these design principles as target features
for high-throughput materials screening, with the goal of
discovering next-generation defect-tolerant PV materials
which are capable of rivalling the performance of the LHP
prototype [18, 42, 53, 60, 70–73, 77, 78]. While there are
likely few materials that match the wealth of defect-tolerant
properties exhibited by lead-halide perovskites, with intelli-
gent discovery techniques driven by detailed understanding of
the underlying chemistry (as depicted in ﬁgure 9), one can
hope that further successful absorber materials may be
unearthed.
In the context of materials screening, some of these
material properties are relatively simple to predict a priori, for
example the cation electronic conﬁguration, bonding cova-
lency and ionic radii, while others, such as those involving
orbital
interactions
or
carrier-capture
kinetics,
can
be
tremendously challenging. For instance, accurate calculation
of the energetic alignment of cation lone-pair and anion p
states (to predict anti-bonding interactions at the VBM in a
perovskite-structured material) is often a computationally
taxing procedure, requiring a high level of theory. Identiﬁca-
tion of ‘self-inhibition’, whether by crystal anharmonicity or
multiple intra-gap levels, requires defect-speciﬁc, quantitative
investigations [70]. Likewise, prediction of benign defect
complexes is not readily amenable to high-throughput
computation, due to the enormous conﬁgurational space and
inherent complexity involved, on top of the substantial cost of
defect calculations. This point serves to reinforce the
importance of strategic organization of materials screening
steps, alongside the judicious selection of chemical descrip-
tors and success criteria, on the basis of relevance, cost,
accuracy and researcher-effort.
After applying these design principles at an intermediate
stage of the screening process (through the use of appropriate
chemical descriptors), explicit defect calculations may then be
performed on the most promising remaining candidates at the
bottom of ‘screening funnel’ (ﬁgure 2), in order to fully assess
their defect tolerance potential and to yield an accurate
performance ﬁgure of merit (SLME, Blank et al, TLC...). In
section 2.3, we provide a brief overview of the practical
calculation of relevant defect properties from ﬁrst-principles.
2.3. Ab-initio defect calculations
A wide range of defect properties (including formation
energies, equilibrium concentrations, charge transition energy
levels, carrier capture coefﬁcients, etc) are now accessible to
theoretical investigation, due in no small part to the afore-
mentioned advances in theory and computational capacity. By
elucidating the physical underpinnings of defect behavior in
solids, chemical models of improved accuracy may be con-
structed in order to better predict, describe and design defect-
related
material
properties.
Such
insights
can
enable

defects (e.g. for improved PV efﬁciency or battery lifetime
[50, 84, 85]).
The purpose of this section is to give a brief ﬂavor of the
practical implementation, frontiers and challenges of this
research. For a more detailed overview of the theory, state-of-
the-art and practical aspects of defect calculations, the keen
reader is directed elsewhere [52, 86, 87].
2.3.1. Supercell approach.
DFT has established itself as the
most powerful technique for ﬁrst-principles investigations in
solid-state
physics
[88,
89],
including
point-defect
calculations [86]. Within DFT, the most widely employed
method for defect calculations is, by far, the ‘supercell’
approach with a plane wave basis set [52, 86, 87]. This
involves placing a defect in an expanded crystal unit cell of
the ‘host’ material (termed a ‘supercell’) with anywhere from
∼50 to 200 atoms, which is then periodically repeated
through space. In doing so, researchers may exploit the power
and versatility of periodic DFT codes, while also guaranteeing
an accurate description of the host material in most cases.

cells have relied on the strategic manipulation of iodine
chemical potentials during crystal growth in order to suppress
non- radiative recombination channels [84].

Charge transition levels are crucial to the electronic behavior
of defects, as their energetic position within the host band
structure is a dominant factor in the recombination activity of
defect centers (vide section 2.2.1).
Employing the computational methods described in
sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, charge transition levels may be
theoretically predicted via equations (3), (4), as illustrated in
ﬁgure 11. Moreover, these levels may be experimentally
detected
via
techniques
such
as
Deep-level
Transient
Spectroscopy (DLTS) [86]. This highlights the importance
of these properties in defect investigations, as they allow for
the powerful combination of theory and experiment to yield
enhanced understanding of defect behavior. Through compar-
ison of theoretical and experimental results, computational

may be interpreted and understood in detail.
2.3.4.
Computational
overhead.
While
standard
DFT
methods (i.e. LDA/GGA) are capable of producing reliable
crystal structures (in most cases), systematic failures in the
prediction of band gaps (section 2.1.2) and charge localization
render them unsuitable for investigations of defect electronic
structure. These electronic properties are crucial to defect
behavior, determining the position of charge transition levels
in the host band structure and hence the nature of the defect
trap state. This issue is tackled via the use of ‘beyond-DFT’
methods, the most popular choice being hybrid DFT, which
inevitably entail signiﬁcant inﬂation of the computational
demand. This requirement of expensive, high-level electronic

supercells (section 2.3.1), is the primary culprit behind the
substantial
computational
cost
associated
with
defect
calculations.
2.3.5. Frontiers and challenges of defect modelling
2.3.5.1.
Automation
and
databases.
At present, defect
investigations entail exorbitant levels of manual researcher
effort, due to the large number of individual calculations
required. Fortunately, a number of computational packages
have been released (including PyCDT [92], PyLada [90],
COFFEE [93], sxdefectalign [94], CarrierCapture.jl [95],
CPLAP [96], SC-Fermi [97]...), which can assist with
efﬁcient pre- and post-processing of these calculations.
Through continued development of comprehensive, ﬂexible,
user-friendly
computational
tools,
researchers
hope
to
accelerate the efﬁciency of defect studies and expand their
applicability to high-throughput materials discovery.
Furthermore, powered by a rapid growth in computa-
tional power and availability of automation frameworks such
as AiiDA [98] and FireWorks [99], databases of material
simulations are being extended to include ab-initio defect
calculations. These invaluable resources will provide the
opportunity to gain powerful chemical insights, especially
when combined with machine learning (ML) models and data
science techniques.
2.3.5.2. Carrier capture.
A crucial step in the process of non-
radiative electron–hole recombination is the capture of
delocalized charge carriers by defect traps, via electron–
phonon coupling. Recent years have seen the development of
theory and computational tools to quantitatively model this
process [95, 100, 101], though further improvements in
efﬁciency, versatility, and reliability are necessary to extend
this approach to general application.
2.3.5.3. Additional hurdles.
Further challenges faced by defect
studies
include
transferability
issues
(due
to
inconsistent
realizations
of
electronic
structure
theory
and
ﬁnite-size
corrections), accurate treatment of ﬁnite-temperature effects
(demanding substantial computational and researcher effort
[86]) and modelling of diffusion/transport properties (limited

3. Classes of perovskite-inspired materials explored
Halide perovskites have the general formula ABX3, where A
is a monovalent organic or inorganic cation, B is an octa-
hedrally coordinated divalent cation, and X is a monovalent
halide such as Cl, Br, or I. Chemical substitution of Pb2+ for
alternative, less-toxic B-site cations has been widely explored.
However, the perovskite crystal structure can only be main-
tained if the cation has a +2 oxidation state and if the ionic
radius can ﬁt within the crystal structure. The latter is
described by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,

where r ,

B and rX are the ionic radii of the A, B, and X site
ions, respectively. Empirically, stable perovskite structures
have t ranging from 0.8 to 1.1 [102], which can only be
achieved by a limited number of compositions [103]. Sub-
stitution of Pb(II) for other metal Group 14 cations with
sufﬁciently large ionic radii (e.g. Sn2+ and Ge2+) can result in
t values within the required range, forming perovskite struc-
tures (i.e. ASnX3 and AGeX3), as shown in ﬁgure 12. An
alternative that allows metal cations without a stable +2
oxidation state to be used is to combine a monovalent and
trivalent cation (e.g. Ag+ and Bi3+), which occupy alternating
octahedra, to form double perovskites. But beyond identify-
ing materials with perovskite crystal structures, efforts have
also focused on the inverse design of defect-tolerant materi-
als, as described in section 2.
This section discusses the synthesis routes and optoe-
lectronic properties of several classes of PIMs considered,
including Sn- and Ge-based perovskites, double perovskites,
as well as other potentially defect-tolerant compounds
(A3B2X9, ABZ2, binary halides, and V–VI–VII materials).
Crystal structures and some important features of the PIMs
discussed here will be illustrated in ﬁgure 13 below and
table 2 at the end of this section, respectively.

Topical Review3.1. Sn-based perovskites
As with lead-halide perovskites, Sn-based perovskites can
have CH3
+
NH3
(MA), CH(NH2)2
+ (FA), Cs+ and other alkali
cations in the A-site. Though most Sn-based perovskites have
a perovskite structure with a high symmetry α cubic phase
(ﬁgure 13), some CsSnX3 perovskites may transform into the
γ orthorhombic phase with distorted octahedra at room
temperature [213], which is mainly due to their smaller tol-
erance factors.
Although many fabrication methods have been devel-
oped for LHPs, these methods are usually not directly com-
patible with their Sn-based counterparts. Sn-based perovskites
crystallize much faster than Pb-based perovskites due to the
lower solubility of SnI2 in typical solvents such as N,N–
dimethylformamide (DMF) [214]. Therefore, Sn-based per-
ovskite thin ﬁlms are often fabricated by modiﬁed solution
methods with the addition of reagents to the precursors.
The one-step solution method was ﬁrst developed by Hao
et al [215]. It has been found that replacing DMF with
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent can reduce the
crystallization rate of Sn-based perovskites by the formation
of the intermediate product SnI2:3DMSO (ﬁgure 14(a)),
leading to pinhole-free ﬁlms [214]. Film morphology has
been further enhanced using solvent engineering methods
(ﬁgure 14(b)). In this method, perovskite precursors are dis-
solved in mixed solvents, such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL)/
DMSO
[216]
and
GBL/1-methyl-2pyrolidinone
(NMP)
[217]. During spin-coating, a non-polar ‘antisolvent’ is
dropped. Common antisolvents include toluene and chlor-
obenzene, which the ionic perovskite precursors are insoluble
in. Dropping the antisolvent causes the intermediate phase to
nucleate and form. After annealing, a uniform thin ﬁlm can be
obtained. Faster reaction between precursors and following
nucleation can signiﬁcantly improves the uniformity of thin
ﬁlms. The morphology of fabricated thin ﬁlms is also strongly
related to the antisolvent used and how it is dropped onto the
spinning substrate.
Sn-based perovskites can also be fabricated by vapor
deposition methods [218, 219], which are advantageous for
depositing multiple layers of over large areas. For instance,
MASnI3 showing complete coverage over the substrate has
been grown through co-evaporation of MAI and SnI2 [220].
Vapor deposition can also be combined with solution
deposition to make ﬁlms with higher quality. For example,
low-temperature vapor-assisted solution processing (LT-
VASP) [221] has been developed to deposit ultrasmooth
MASnI3 thin ﬁlms (ﬁgure 14(c)). Two steps were involved in
this method. Firstly, SnI2 thin ﬁlms were spin-coated onto
mesoporous TiO2 substrates. Secondly, the substrates kept at
60 ℃were placed over MAI powder heated at 150 ℃and
MASnI3 ﬁlms would then form as MAI was evaporated onto
SnI2 ﬁlms.
In addition, some tin-halide additives such as SnF2 and
SnCl2 have been introduced into the above methods to pro-
mote the ﬁlm quality in many aspects. For example, SnF2
added in CsSnI3 can reduce the Sn vacancies and enhance the
stability of perovskites without changing the lattice para-
meters [222, 223]. On the other hand, SnCl2 may form an
ultrathin hole transport layer at the ITO/CsSnI3 interface and
improve the carrier extraction [121].
Similar to lead-halide perovskites, Sn-based perovskites
also have direct band gaps ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 eV with
high absorption coefﬁcients of around 104 cm−1 in visible
region [224]. Band gap tunability is crucial for the design of
tandem solar cells, where semiconductors with different band
gaps are stacked sequentially in order to absorb different
regions of the solar spectrum. It has been shown that different
X-site halides can greatly affect the band gap of Sn-based
perovskites [215, 225]. For instance, the band gap can be
tuned from 1.3 to 3.61 eV from by changing the X anion in
MASnX3 from I−to Cl−. Also, Sn/Pb hybrid perovskites
were found to exhibit signiﬁcant band gap bowing, where the
alloy band gaps are smaller than the band gap of both end
compounds. Recently, MA(Pb1−xSnx)I3 has demonstrated a
band gap below 1.2 eV at x=0.5 [226]. Goyal et al
showed through computations that this extraordinary feature
is primary due to the energy mismatch between the s and p
orbitals between Sn and Pb and their nonlinear mixing
(ﬁgure 15) [227].
Sn-based perovskites tend to become p-type due to the
self-doping. Although the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ should
release electrons (n-doping), the lower formation energies of
Sn vacancies [122] and some processes such as the reaction of
Sn2+ with O2 may create holes and lead to p-doping [213].
However, the mechanism behind p-type doping is not fully
understood yet. p-type self-doping leads to high mobilities
and metal-like conductivity of Sn-based perovskites. Rela-
tively small effective masses (0.01–0.11m0, m0: rest mass of
an electron) caused by the dispersive VBM further improve
their carrier transport. A hole mobility of 585 and 322 cm2
V−1 s−1 have been reported in CsSnI3 and MASnI3 poly-
crystalline ingots, respectively [110, 122], based on Hall-
effect and resistivity measurement. Interestingly, Stoumpos

perovskites with different B-site cations based on their ionic radii

16
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewet al claimed that the p-type character of Sn-based perovskites
is related to the formation of Sn4+ centers, which could be
suppressed by the introduction of a powerful reducing agent
(e.g. H3PO2). Eventually, they showed that n-type poly-
crystalline CsSnI3 and MASnI3 could be obtained and also
exhibit high electron mobilities of 2320 and 536 cm2 V−1 s−1
(from Hall-effect measurement), respectively [110].
The carrier lifetime has been reported to be 59 ps and 6.6
ns in FASnI3 thin ﬁlms with 20 mol% SnF2 additives and
CsSnI3 single crystals [117, 123], respectively. These relatively
short carrier lifetimes compared to their Pb-based counterparts
were mainly related to the electron recombination with large
background hole densities (1014–1019 cm−3) [122, 228].
However, the incorporation of ethylenediammonium (en) or
SnF2 in some Sn-based perovskites has been found to reduce Sn
vacancies and extend carrier lifetimes [111, 229]. For instance,
MASnI3 thin ﬁlms with 20 mol% SnF2 have shown a lifetime
longer than 10 ns, which is almost 5–10 times of that of pristine
MASnI3 [111]. Moreover, the addiction of ZnI2 could even
improve the carrier lifetimes of FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskites up to
∼1 μs [230]. The presence of these sub-gap defects also results
in the low PLQEs of Sn-based perovskites. As a result, the
PLQEs of mixed Pb-Sn perovskites under solar illumination
were typically less than 1% [231]. It is worth mentioning that

Topical Revieweven with such short carrier lifetimes, Sn-based perovskites can
still exhibit long diffusion length over 500 nm [111] mainly due
to their high mobilities.
Poor stability is one of the main issues of Sn-based
perovskites because Sn2+ is prone to oxidation into the more
stable Sn4+ after exposure to ambient air [19]. A signiﬁcant
reduction in PL lifetime was observed in FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 ﬁlms
after one-minute of air exposure [230], indicating that Sn-
based perovskites should be encapsulated immediately after
fabrication in order to maintain their performance. In addition,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that MASnI3
prepared in air would start to decompose at lower temperature
(∼150 ℃) compared to that prepared in a sealed tube or
solution (>300 ℃) [110], which is related to the presence of
Sn4+ and liberation of volatile SnI4. Nevertheless, both
decomposition temperatures are signiﬁcantly higher than the
range of testing temperatures for solar cells (25℃under
standard conditions, or 85 ℃for accelerated degradation

Topical Reviewtesting), indicating that MASnI3 is sufﬁciently thermally
stable for device applications. Further details on how the
stability of Sn-based perovskites could be improved for
applications in devices are discussed in section 4.2.
3.2. Ge-based perovskites
There have been few experimental reports of Ge-based per-
ovskites focusing on AGeX3 (A=Cs+, MA+, or FA+), in
which X=I−or a mixture of I−and Br−. The Ge-based
perovskites discussed here exhibit trigonal structure (ﬁgure 13),
where the distorted GeX6 octahedra are arranged in a corner-
sharing pattern with A cations align along the c-axis.
Solution-based methods are used to synthesize most Ge-
based perovskites. For example, MAGeI3−xBrx (x=0–0.6)
solution could be prepared by dissolving MAI, MABr, and
GeI2 in DMF [126]. On the other hand, various Ge-based
perovskite precipitates can be obtained by adding different
iodide salts (CsI, MAI, or FAI) into the solution containing
HI, H3PO2 and GeO2, where H3PO2 and GeO2 acts as the
reduction agent and Ge source, respectively [128, 232]. Ge-
based perovskite precipitates can be dissolved into DMF to
make solutions, and thin ﬁlms can be fabricated via one-step
methods [128] or by using solution engineering methods
[126] to improve the ﬁlm qualities. Unsatisfactory solubility
of the precursors in polar solvents is a limiting factor of
synthesizing Ge-based perovskites, which may lead to poorer
ﬁlm qualities [128].
CsGeI3, MAGeI3, and FAGeI3 have direct band gaps
varying from 1.6 to 2.35 eV with increasing A cation size
[128]. These Ge-based perovskites also have strong absorp-
tion in the wavelength range between 400 and 600 nm, along
with sharp edges. From thermogravimetric (TGA) measure-
ments, Ge-based perovskites were found to exhibit high
thermal stability since they tended to decompose at temper-
ature >250 ℃[128]. However, similar to Sn-based per-
ovskites, Ge-based perovskites also face stability issues in air,
which is attributed to the oxidation of Ge2+ to the more stable
Ge4+. The tendency of Ge2+ to oxidize is supported by x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, which
show the presence of Ge4+ in the Ge 2p orbital scan [128].
Under ambient conditions, it was shown the absorption of
MAGeI3 thin ﬁlms would drop by over 50% within one day.
Kopacic et al showed that the addition of Br into MAGeI3 can
improve its ambient stability [126], though the ﬁlms could
only maintain one third of its initial absorption after one day.
3.3. Double perovskites
Although In, Sb and Bi are promising low-toxicity substitutes
for Pb (see section 2), they tend to form a +3 oxidation state.
Direct substitution of these metal cations into the B-site in
perovskites would result in a non-perovskite crystal structure
forming. This issue can be solved by using a double per-
ovskite structure with the general formula: A2B′B″X6, where
A and X are monovalent cations and halides, respectively.
But two Pb2+ cations are replaced by a pair of monovalent B′
and trivalent B″ cations. This allows charge neutrality to be
maintained in a perovskite crystal structure, which is then
comprised of alternating B′
-
X65
and B″
-
X63
octahedra
(ﬁgure 13). Examples of B′ cations that have been commonly
used experimentally include Ag+ and Na+, which are paired
with In3+, Sb3+ or Bi3+ B″ cations. Although double per-
ovskites have a 3D crystal structure, in some cases, the
[B′X6]5−octahedra do not contribute to the density of states
at the band-edges and result in 0D electronic dimensionality
[71], which may lead to large indirect band gaps and hinder
carrier transport. Due to this reduced electronic dimension-
ality, effective masses for double perovskites usually display
anisotropic behavior, though most calculated values are still
small (between 0.1 and 0.5m0) [20].
Double perovskites can be synthesized through solution
processing methods. For instance, polycrystalline Cs2AgBiX6
can be obtained by dissolving AgX, BiX3, and CsX in
hydrohalic acid HX/hypophosphorous acid mixed solvents
[130]. Double perovskite thin ﬁlms can then be fabricated via
spin-coating or thermal evaporation of as-synthesized pow-
ders [233]. On the other hand, the synthesis of hybrid halide
double perovskites is more difﬁcult compared to that of
inorganic double perovskites owing to the low decomposition
and vaporization energies of the organic precursors. There-
fore, most hybrid double perovskites were synthesized either
by solid-state reaction or hydrothermal methods [141, 142],
though these two synthesis routes can apply to other inorganic
double perovskites as well [130, 138]. Apart from the bulk
crystals, double perovskites can be also synthesized as
nanocrystals through hot-injection methods. For example,
Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals would form when Cs-oleate is
injected into the organic solvent (oleic acid or oleylamine)
containing BiBr3 and AgNO3 at 200 ℃[234]. The impurities
can be reduced by introducing additives (e.g. HBr) as well as
controlling the injection temperature. Particularly, Cs2AgBiI6
nanocrystals could be obtained via anion-exchange process
by injecting TMSI to convert Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals into
the target material [235], even though Cs2AgBiI6 is expected
to be thermodynamically unstable compared to Cs2AgBiBr6.
Double perovskite solutions can be prepared by dissolving the
synthesized products in solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and ﬁlms are fabricated by spin-coating these
solutions following annealing processes. Annealing at high
temperature or under low pressure [236] (low-pressure
assisted annealing) can give crystalline ﬁlms without phase
impurities. Also, the utilization of antisolvents, such as IPA,
during spin-coating has been shown to improve ﬁlm quality
and reduce the root-mean square roughness [131]. The main
challenge for preparing double perovskite samples is the high
temperature requirement involved in dissolving some inso-
luble precursors [237] (e.g. AgCl), solid-state reaction [238],
or annealing process [239]. This challenge may limit the
application of double perovskite devices on substrates intol-
erant to high temperature (e.g. ITO glass) or their compat-
ibility with other materials.
Most double perovskites have low absorption coefﬁcients
(102–104 cm−1 in visible region [133]) at the band-edge due
to an indirect band gap (e.g. Cs2AgBiBr6 or MA2AgBiBr6) or
a parity forbidden band gap (e.g. Cs2AgInCl6 [240]), which
21
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewlimits their SLMEs. For example, Cs2AgBiBr6, which is the
most common double perovskite explored experimentally,
has an SLME of 7.9% [42]. Band gaps of double perovskites
range from around 2 to 3.4 eV [235], which are too large for
PV applications. Band gap engineering is therefore important.
Doping or elemental substitution can tune the band gaps. Tran
et al demonstrated that the band gaps of Cs2Ag(SbxIn1−x)Cl6
can decrease with increased Sb content and experience a
transition from direct to indirect character [241], which stems
from the dominant p-orbitals contributed by Sb3+ for the
hybridization at band-edges, as illustrated in ﬁgure 16. In
addition, Li, Kavanagh et al showed that band gap bowing
occurs in Cs2Ag(SbxBi1−x)Br6 [75]. The alloy double per-
ovskites exhibited a band gap value of 2.08 eV at x=0.9,
which is smaller than Cs2AgSbBr6 (2.18 eV) and Cs2AgBiBr6
(2.25 eV). The mechanism for band gap bowing is similar to
that of MA(Pb1−xSnx)I3 (refer to section 3.1 and ﬁgure 15).
That is, the lower band gap exhibited by the alloys of
Cs2Ag(SbxBi1−x)Br6 is due to the energy mismatch between s
and p orbitals from Bi and Sb cations, and their nonlinear
mixing.
The investigations of lifetimes and carrier mobilities for
double perovskites were mainly focused on Cs2AgBiBr6.
Though trap densities on the order of 1016 cm−3 are present in
Cs2AgBiBr6 bulk crystals [134], they can be reduced by
thermal annealing in N2 [135]. Annealed Cs2AgBiBr6 thin
ﬁlms have demonstrated long lifetimes of 1.4 μs [133], which
is approaching that of multi-crystalline Si used in commercial
solar cells [242]. However, the carrier transport of double
perovskites is limited by larger effective masses than in lead-
halide perovskites, as well as strong electron–phonon cou-
pling (Refer to section 3.9). Consequently, Cs2AgBiBr6 sin-
gle crystals were found to simply exhibit moderate mobilities
of 11.81 cm2 V−1 s−1 [135].
Cs2AgBiBr6 can maintain a stable phase in ambient air
(with a relative humidity of ∼60%) and in the dark for
3 months [135], though signiﬁcant surface discoloration can
be observed after 15 d of light exposure, which possibly
stems from the photosensitivity of silver [243]. TGA results
also showed that Cs2AgBiBr6 has higher thermal stability of
up to 430 °C, while (MA)2AgBiBr6 would decompose at
around 277 ℃[142] due to its organic A-site cations. Parti-
cularly, double perovskites such as Cs2InBiX6, Cs2CuInX6 or
Cs2AgInX6 that include Cu+, or In+ as B′-site cations have
been conﬁrmed theoretically to be relatively unstable owing
to the small ionic radii, higher d orbital levels, and redox
tendency of these B′ cations [244, 245].
3.4. Chalcogenide perovskites
Chalcogenide perovskites also have the ABX3 chemical
formula, but have the X-site anions replaced by S2−. Owing
to their stable crystal structure and smaller band gaps
(1.5–2 eV), BaZrS3, SrZrS3, LaYS3 are materials investigated
most among chalcogenide perovskites. Due to the small
electronegativity between B-site cations and sulfur, these
materials tend to have strong covalent B–X bonding elements,
which is beneﬁcial to narrowed band gaps and carrier trans-
port. The stronger Coulombic attraction between A2+ and
[BS6]8−can also enhance the ambient stability of chalco-
genide perovskites. For example, it has also been shown that
both BaZrS3 and SrZrS3 samples stored in air showed no
signiﬁcant degradation in structure and physical properties
after one year. It is worth mentioning that the −2 charge of
the X-site anion now allows B-site cations that are more
stable in +4 oxidation state to be used (e.g. Sn4+ and Ge4+).
As shown in ﬁgure 13, BaZrS3 exists in distorted perovskite
phase with corner sharing BX6 octahedra. SrZrS3 may form
similar distorted perovskite phase (b phase) or needle-like
phase with edge-sharing BX6 octahedra (a phase) at room
temperature depending on the synthesis routes. The crystal
structure of LaYS3 is different from 3D perovskite since the
oxidation states of A- and B-sites are both 3+. Therefore,
LaYS3 tend to form a 2D structure with [Y3S9]9−layers
extended in the [bc] plane and separated by La3+ ions.
Phase pure BaZrS3 can be obtained by sulfurization of
BaZrO3 with CS2 at 1050 °C for 4 h [246]. Alternatively,
heating the stochiometric mixtures of ground and cold-pres-
sed BaS and ZrS2 at 800 °C–1000 ℃for 15 h under high
vacuum can also make BaZrS3 product, though further pur-
iﬁcation will be required [247]. Niu et al also made BaZrS3
powders by heating BaS, Zr, and sulphur pieces with sto-
chiometric quantities in a quartz tube at 600 ℃for 60 h [210].
I2 was introduced in this method to act as a catalyst to
enhances the reactivity of transition metals. Experimentally,
BaZrS3 has direct band gaps of 1.75–1.85 eV [23, 247] with
large absorption coefﬁcients was on the order of 105 cm−1
from UV to visible range. Ti-alloying has been found to

Topical Revieweffectively reduce the band gap of BaZrS3 to 1.51 eV [248],
resulting a theoretical conversion efﬁciency up to 32%.
BaZrS3 was found to exhibit n-type characteristic with high
carrier density between 1019 and 1020 cm−3, which may arise
from excess electrons released when S vacancies form [208].
The Hall mobilities of BaZrS3 thin ﬁlms were reported to
range from 2.1 to 13.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 [208], which have been
comparable to those of MAPbI3 [249]. The higher mobilities
also correspond to larger grain size and better crystallinity of
BaZrS3 thin ﬁlms sulfurized at higher temperature. In addi-
tion, a PL at the wavelength accounting for the band gap and
a lifetime of around 400 ns were observed in BaZrS3 thin
ﬁlms [208, 210], indicating relatively lower defect density
within this material.
SrZrS3 can be synthesized via mixing SrS, Zr and sulfur at
stoichiometric quantities along with iodine as catalyst in a
quartz tube [210]. α-SrZrS3 and β-SrZrS3 would be obtained
after heating the mixture at 850 ℃and 1100 ℃for 60 h,
respectively. A similar synthesis process was conducted by
heating Sr, Zr powders and sulfur at 850 ℃and 1000 ℃for
3 weeks to prepare α-SrZrS3 and β-SrZrS3, respectively [211].
α-SrZrS3 and β-SrZrS3 individually exhibits a direct band gap
of around 1.53 and 2.05–2.13 eV, and both phases have large
absorption coefﬁcients on the order of 104–105 cm−1 in the UV
to visible range [23, 210]. Especially, polycrystalline β-SrZrS3
showed a high PL intensity comparable to that of single crys-
talline CdSe and InP and its highest EQE is even higher than
that of CIGS solar cells [210]. A high VOC was thus expected in
SrZrS3-based solar cells based on these features.
LaYS3 thin ﬁlms can be fabricated by the two-step pro-
cess [23]. At the ﬁrst step, La and Y atoms were deposited on
a substrate via co-sputtering in order to form LaY ﬁlms. The
second step is to sulfurize the deposited LaY ﬁlms at 950 ℃–
1000 ℃with a H2S ﬂow at atmospheric pressure. Crovetto
et al showed that the introduction of O2 at the ﬁrst step could
result in LaY ﬁlms with improved morphology and fewer
impurities. LaYS3 thin ﬁlms were found to display a band
gap of 2 eV with absorption coefﬁcients on the order of
-
10
10
4
5 cm−1 in the UV to visible range [23]. LaYS3 ﬁlms
also showed a PL intensity higher than that of high-efﬁciency
CZTS thin ﬁlms, implying their lower defect densities [23].
However, based on the time-resolved microwave conductivity
(TRMC) measurement, LaYS3 ﬁlms demonstrated a low
mobility of only 0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1 (lower limit) and a
relatively long carrier lifetime of 30 ns (upper limit) [212].
These results could be attributed to the presence of highly
localized defect states, which has been observed in spatially
resolved PL images [212]. Additionally, LaYS3 was found
to be an n-type material with a low doping density
(∼1014 cm−3) and similar band position with MAPbI3 [212].
Complicated processing and the high processing tem-
peratures are two of the main challenges for synthesizing
chalcogenide perovskites and integrating them with other
transport layers, where contact materials may diffuse into
active layers and form unwanted materials after heating [212].
Consequently, although many potential chalcogenide per-
ovskites have been predicted theoretically, most of them are
not yet realized experimentally.
3.5. A3B2X9 materials
Owing to the low toxicity and the similar electron conﬁguration
with Pb2+, Bi3+ and Sb3+ might serve as alternatives for the
B-site cations in perovskites. To satisfy charge balance, how-
ever, an A3B2X9 arrangement would be needed. These A3B2X9
materials can be considered as defect-ordered perovskites,
where only 2/3 of the B-site cations of the perovskites are
occupied, thus forming an A3B2,X9 structure. These A3B2X9
materials have been found to form two polymorphs. One is the
0D dimer-phase structure consisting of isolated bioctahedral
clusters, while the other is 2D layered structure, which forms
from general ABX3 arrangement with the removal of every
third B layer along the crystal axis (ﬁgure 13). While some
materials have a ﬁxed structure, other materials (e.g. Cs3Sb2I9)
have been found to capable of switching between 0D and 2D
structures depending on the processing and composition
[250, 251]. Several A3B2X9 materials have been investigated as
potential absorber layers in future PV devices. These include (i)
0D: MA3Bi2X9 (X=Cl, Br, I), FA3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, (ii) 0D/
2D:
Cs3Sb2I9,
(iii)
2D:
MA3Sb2I9,
Rb3Sb2I9,
and
K3Sb2I9, K3Bi2I9, Rb3Bi2I9, and (NH4)3Bi2I9.
Most A3B2I9 materials can be synthesized via solution
processing methods, which resemble those used for preparing
LHPs. For instance, MA3Bi2I9 solutions can be prepared by
mixing MAI and BiI3 in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents
[144, 154]. A3B2X9 ﬁlms can be fabricated through spin-
coating followed by annealing or solvent engineering meth-
ods [21, 151] to promote ﬁlm crystallization. Some modiﬁed
methods can be applied to further improve ﬁlm quality. For
instance, the PL lifetime of MA3Bi2I9 ﬁlms can be extended
by using vapor-assisted conversion, where high-quality
MA3Bi2I9 ﬁlms would form by exposing BiI3 ﬁlms to MAI
vapor [145]. Various A3B2X9 powders can also be prepared
by solid-state synthesis, where AX and BX3 powders can
react to form A3B2X9 product under ball-milling [146]. To
grow A3B2X9 single crystals, the Bridgman method is a
common synthesis route. In this method, precursors are sealed
in an ampoule and placed into in a two-zone furnace, where
raw materials would melt in the hot-zone and crystallize in the
cold-zone [252]. Other than these general methods, some 0D
phase materials can also be synthesized by different methods.
(NH4)3Bi2I9 single crystals would precipitate when heating
(NH4)I in a mix of BiI3/HI for 3 h. Also, high-quality
Rb3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 powders could be obtained by sol-
vothermal reactions [152]. Particularly, for materials that can
transform between the 0D and 2D phase, 2D polymorphs are
usually more desirable for optoelectronic applications since
their stacked planes can exhibit higher mobilities. Therefore,
although 0D Cs3Sb2I9 can be easily synthesized by simple
solution
processing
with
antisolvent
engineering,
more
researchers have worked on achieving 2D Cs3Sb2I9 via var-
ious routes. Singh et al employed a vapor-assisted solution
processing method to deposit 2D Cs3Sb2I9 ﬁlms [156], which
were annealed inside an enclosed bottle ﬁlled with SbI3 vapor
to prevent the decomposition of material, as illustrated in
ﬁgure 17. A similar synthesis was taken in 2D Rb3Sb2I9 ﬁlms
[161] as well. Umar et al also found that HCl could be used as
23
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewa coordinated additive to promote the formation of 2D phase
Cs3Sb2I9 [157]. Recently, another approach found to favor the
formation of the 2D phase of Cs3Sb2I9 was to alloy with Cl
[250]. In addition, by alloying with smaller halides, such as Cl
or Br, 0D Cs3Bi2I9 was found to be transformed into 2D
polymorphs [253, 254], where a complete anion ordering has
been shown in some work [253]. 2D Cs3Bi2I6Br3 has been
prepared by heating the DMF/DMSO mixture solvent con-
taining stoichiometric mixtures of CsI, BiI3, and BiBr3 [255].
On the other hand, 2D Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 ingots can be synthesized
via a stoichiometric melt reaction of CsCl with BiI3 at
750 ℃[254].
Although A3B2X9 materials generally have wide band
gaps larger than 1.9 eV, large absorption coefﬁcients of up to
105 cm−1 in the UV–visible region (wavelength <600 nm)
have been presented in some of them (e.g. Cs3Sb2I9 and
MA3Bi2I9 [144, 251]). In addition, materials in distinct phases
can also demonstrate different band gap characteristic. For
instance, it has been shown that 2D Cs3Sb2I9 exhibits a direct
band gap of 2.05 eV, while its 0D polymorph has an indirect
band gap of 2.4 eV [251]. In addition, 2D Cs3Bi2I6Br3 also
shows a reduced band gap of 2.03 eV compared with that of
0D Cs3Bi2I9 (2.2 eV), which is related to a transition in
crystal structures [255]. A gradual decrease in band gap from
over 2.6 to 2.06 eV has been observed in 0D Cs3Bi2Br9 when
alloyed with iodide (Cs3Bi2Br9−xIx). This in turn transformed
the 0D material into 2 D Cs3Bi2Br3I6 [253].
Apart from MA3Bi2I9 and (NH4)3Bi2I9 single crystals,
which have demonstrated a high mobility of 70 cm2 V−1 s−1
(hole mobility based on the Hall-effect measurement) and
213 cm2 V−1 s−1 (sum mobility based on the SCLC method),
respectively [147, 155], most A3B2X9 materials suffer from
poor carrier transport due to the strong electron–phonon
coupling (refer to section 3.9) and their low dimensional
crystal structures, where carriers can be trapped within the
isolated regions of materials. Not surprisingly, 0D A3B2X9
materials usually have lower carrier mobilities than the 2D
ones. For example, based on the space charge limited current
(SCLC) method, 0D Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals showed a hole
mobility on the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 [153], while 2D
MA3Sb2I9 single crystals were found to have an electron and
hole mobility over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 (or over 40 cm2 V−1 s−1
with Sn doping) [159, 160]. Similar differences can be
observed between 0D and 2D Cs3Sb2I9. It has been veriﬁed
by the SCLC method that 2D Cs3Sb2I9 thin ﬁlms have a hole
mobility of 6.81 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost double that in
0D polymorphs [157]. In addition, carrier transport in low
dimensional materials can experience signiﬁcant anisotropy
along different axes. For instance, estimated mobility-lifetime
(mt) product could vary by over two times under the photo-
conductivity measurement along b- and c-axis of MA3Bi2I9
single crystals [147]. Additionally, the low dimensionality
also leads to large exciton binding energies since excitons
could be trapped as well. The exciton binding energies in
most A3B2X9 materials have been estimated to vary from 70
to 270 meV [21, 144], which are signiﬁcantly larger than
those reported from Pb-based perovskites (25–50 meV)
[256, 257] and could make carrier extraction from these
materials relatively challenging.
Several A3B2X9 materials have shown promising carrier
lifetimes. Evaluating from its mt product, single crystalline
MA3Bi2I9 and (NH4)3Bi2I9 may have carrier lifetimes up to
40 and >51.6 μs, respectively [147, 155]. Also, a PL lifetime
of 271 ns was reported in MA3Sb2I9 single crystals [159]. The
different polymorphs of Cs3Sb2I9 were also found to have
different carrier lifetimes due to differences in their defect
densities. Based on the SCLC model, 2D Cs3Sb2I9 was found
to have a trap density of
´
1.1
1015 cm−3, which is almost
ﬁve times smaller than that of 0D Cs3Sb2I9 [157]. Further-
more, 2D Cs3Sb2I9 also shows a lower Urbach energy
(134 meV) in comparison with 0D Cs3Sb2I9 (162 meV),
which veriﬁes its less structurally disordered feature [156]
(although these values are still signiﬁcantly higher than that of
Pb-based perovskites (∼15 meV [258])). However, only a PL
lifetime of 6 ns has been reported in 2D Cs3Sb2I9 single
crystals [156], which is shorter than that of 0D Cs3Sb2I9 thin
ﬁlms (54.29 ns) [21]. This result may be related to the pre-
sence of deep-level states in 2D Cs3Sb2I9 [251].
A3B2I9 materials are found to be stable in air. The

Topical Review(NH4)3Bi2I9 hardly decomposes until 250 ℃and 240 ℃
[145, 154], respectively, indicating they are thermally stable
as well. However, though the PXRD patterns for Cs3Bi2I9 in
ambient atmosphere could maintain unchanged for a few
months, that of K3Bi2I9 could not keep well after a few hours,
which implies that the larger cation sizes may strengthen the
stability of crystal structures [152].
3.6. ABZ2 materials
ABZ2 materials here refer to ternary chalcogenides, where
A=Na, Ag, Cu and other cations with stable +1 charge
states, and B-site cations and Z-site anions are generally Sb/
Bi and S/Se. These materials are expected to be promising in
PV application due to their usage of earth-abundant and non-
toxic elements. In this section, we will mainly focus on the
discussion
of
NaBiS2,
NaSbS2,
AgBiS2,
CuSbS2,
and
CuSbSe2, which have been experimentally investigated.
Among these materials, NaBiS2, NaSbS2, and AgBiS2 have a
rock salt structure with mixed cations octahedrally coordi-
nated by anions (ﬁgure 13). Interestingly, different cation
ratios can lead to various superstructures known as ‘coloring
patterns’, which can change their crystal structures and band
gaps [22]. Instead of a rock salt structure, CuSbS2 and
CuSbSe2 exhibits layered orthorhombic structure composed
of SbZ5 units (ﬁgure 13).
NaBiS2 can be obtained by melt synthesis [259], in which
powders of S, Bi, and Na2S are mixed in a sealed tube, followed
by a series of heating steps at high temperature for very long
reaction time (∼9 d). The hydrothermal method [260] can
reduce
the
reaction
time
by
heating
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O,
L-cysteine and NaOH in an autoclave at high temperature for
around 3 d. Solution-based routes have also been used. For
instance, Rosales et al used S, NaH, and triphenylbismuth as
precursors, and NaBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) with different sizes
can be synthesized with different solvents and reaction para-
meters [22]. Particularly, NaBiS2 quantum dots (QDs) can be
synthesized by the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction
(SILAR) technique [166], where QD sizes can be controlled by
different concentrations of the precursor solution. NaBiS2 has
been found to have an indirect band gap of about 1.2–1.45 eV,
in agreement with computations [22]. Absorption measure-
ments of NaBiS2 QDs under different conditions showed that
their band gaps increase with the decrease of QD sizes,
implying the quantum conﬁnement effect of this material [166],
which occurs when QD sizes become comparable with the
excitonic Bohr radius of the material. Also, large extinction
coefﬁcients over 104 cm−1 M−1 in visible region [22] shows the
great potential of NaBiS2 NCs on PV application. On the other
hand, Zhong et al theoretically proved that NaBiS2 is a ferro-
electric material with a large polarization (∼33 μC cm−2) [261],
which
may
improve
the
carrier
separation
by
strong
induced ﬁeld.
NaSbS2 thin ﬁlms can be synthesized through spray
pyrolysis [169], where the precursor solution (Na2S and
Sb2S3 in water) is sprayed onto a substrate heated at 230 ℃to
reacted into products. Also, NaSbS2 QDs can be deposited on
the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes via Successive Ionic Layer
Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) followed by post-anneal-
ing procedure [262]. NaSbS2 has an indirect band gap of
around 1.5–1.8 eV along with large absorption coefﬁcients of
about 104–105 cm−1 in the visible range [169, 262]. Rahayu
et al showed that the overall band gap of QDs-coated TiO2
will decrease signiﬁcantly with the increase of SILAR cycles,
which is also a result of quantum conﬁnement effect [170]. In
addition, Xia et al used UPS and Hall effect measurements to
demonstrate that NaSbS2 is a weakly n-type material with an
electron mobility between 14 and 22 cm2 V−1 s−1 [169].
AgBiS2 has been synthesized via several methods in the
literature. Earlier reports were usually based on SILAR
methods [172] and spray pyrolysis [263]. In addition, AgBiS2
has been grown as nanocrystals (NCs) by hot injection
method [264] involving the rapid injection of a sulfur source
into the oleic acid solution containing bismuth and silver salts
at high temperature. However, hot injection needs to be
performed under vacuum, or within inert gas, which is
inconvenient and costly. Some researchers thus worked on
preparing AgBiS2 NCs at room temperature and under
ambient atmosphere. Pejova et al showed that AgBiS2 NCs
could be easily synthesized through dissolving AgNO3,
Bi(NO3)3, and Na2S2O3 in nitric acid, and NC sizes could be
reduced under high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation [265].
Recently, Akgul et al used air-stable precursors such as AgI
and BiI3 dissolved in amines, and AgBiS2 NCs would form
after quickly injecting another sulphur-amine solution [266].
AgBiS2 has been found to have indirect band gaps of about
1.15–2.7 eV, and exhibits high absorption coefﬁcients of
around 104–105 cm−1 from visible to near-infrared range
[264]. Similar to NaBiS2, tunable band gaps have been
observed in AgBiS2 QDs with different sizes [172]. This
tunability is also ascribed to the quantum conﬁnement effect
when QD sizes approached the excitonic Bohr radius of
AgBiS2 (4.6 nm [267]). AgBiS2 also displays disperse band-
edges and hence small effective carrier masses [267], which
should favor carrier transport. However, only a small carrier
mobility less than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a short diffusion
length of 150 nm were reported for AgBiS2 NC thin ﬁlms by
the TRMC method [173]. These poor performances may be
resulted from the presence of deep-level defects, which has
been predicted to arise from the minor off-stoichiometry of
AgBiS2 NCs [268]. Nevertheless, an extremely long carrier
lifetime up to 1.67 ms was still seen in AgBiS2 QD thin ﬁlm
based on photoconductivity measurement [174], implying
that the defect physics of this material is not yet fully
understood.
CuSbS2 thin ﬁlms can be fabricated by many techniques
including thermal evaporation [269], sputtering [270], che-
mical bath deposition (CBD) [271], electrodeposition [272],
ALD [273], solvothermal synthesis [274] and so on. On the
other hand, solvothermal [275] and hot injection methods
[276] can be also applied on the synthesis of CuSbS2 nano-
particles. This material has been shown to have large
absorption coefﬁcients over 104 cm−1 in the visible region as
well as direct band gaps ranging from around 1.4–1.9 eV,
depending on various deposition processes [178–180]. DFT
calculation also predicted that CuSbS2 tends to exhibit p-type
25
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewcharacteristic owing to the presence of dominant Cu vacan-
cies [277] acting as electron acceptors. It also exhibits small
carrier effective masses of around 0.3 m0 [277], leading to a
high hole mobility of 64.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 [181]. Yang et al’s
work also demonstrated that CuSbS2 may be defect tolerant
owing to higher formation enthalpies for deep-level defects
and the shallow transition level of Cu vacancies [277].
However, CuSbS2 thin ﬁlms were found to have a carrier
lifetime of only 0.7 ns even after the improvement on ﬁlm
quality via thermal treatment [182, 278].
CuSbSe2 thin ﬁlms can be deposited through evaporation
[279], co-sputtering of Cu2Se and Sb2Se3 [184], sulfurization
of Cu-Sb alloy [180], and electrodeposition [280]. Particu-
larly, Yang et al also fabricated CuSbSe2 by the hydrazine
method, which involved the preparation of precursors such as
Cu2S, Sb2Se3 in hydrazine with speciﬁc stoichiometry [185].
In addition, it has been shown that CuSbSe2 single crystals
could also be synthesized by the hot-injection technique
[281]. One main challenge within these methods is that sev-
eral competitive phases may occur concomitantly, making
pure phase CuSbSe2 can be obtained only under strictly
controlled environment [185, 186]. CuSbSe2 has direct band
gaps of 1–1.2 eV [185], which is close to the optimal band
gap for single-junction solar cells. Moreover, Tiwari et al
showed that CuSbSe2 also exhibits large absorption coefﬁ-
cients up to
´
6.6
106 cm−1 in the visible region [282],
indicating its potential as a solar absorber. Similar to CuSbS2,
a p-type characteristic caused by Cu vacancies is also
observed in CuSbSe2 with a high hole concentration over
1017 cm−3 being reported [184]. However, the larger effective
hole mass (0.9m0 [187]) of CuSbSe2 may lead to a lower Hall
mobility of 20.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 [188] compared to CuSbS2.
Though Xue et al predicted that CuSbSe2 would have benign
defect properties [188], Welch et al indicated that Se vacan-
cies could serve as deep-level defect states that may inﬂuence
the carrier lifetime, which has been conﬁrmed by a short
carrier lifetime of 190 ps measured via transient THz
spectroscopy technique [186].
In terms of stability, it has been claimed that AgBiS2 and
NaBiS2 are stable in air for at least several weeks [22, 264].
No obvious degradation issues have been reported in the lit-
erature for other ABZ2 materials, but Peccerillo et al believed
that Cu-related instability resulted from ions migration under
continuous DC operation may occur in Cu-based ABZ2
materials [283].
3.7. Binary halides
Binary halides are compounds made from heavy metals and
halides, which contain cations with valence s2 electrons,
making them promising for potentially exhibiting defect tol-
erance (refer to section 2). InI, BiI3, and SbI3 have been
investigated most as PV materials among all binary halides,
and we will focus our discussion on them. InI has an
orthorhombic crystal structure with layers stacked along the
b-axis [191] (ﬁgure 13), and every two atom sheets are
staggered in this structure, making In atoms bonded more
closely with adjacent In atoms. On the other hand, BiI3 and
SbI3 exhibit layered structures [26, 193] with each layer
composed of edge-sharing metal-halide octahedra bonded
together by van der Waals interactions.
InI ﬁlms can be deposited by thermal evaporation [107],
or fabricated from the melt [18], where the In metal-I pellets
mixture was placed into a quartz ampoule and heated at
400 °C for 12 h to ensure the complete reaction into InI.
Alternatively, Shah et al used the Bridgman method to grow
InI single crystals by placing puriﬁed InI into a vertical fur-
nace kept at 450 ℃but with a sharp temperature drop at the
bottom, where melted InI can crystallize as molten InI moved
down [284]. InI has a direct band gap of around 2 eV, which
has been veriﬁed in calculation and experiment [107]. It has
been reported that InI can exhibit reasonably long PL lifetime
over 6 ns [18] and large mobility-lifetime products corresp-
onding to a diffusion length of around 16 μm [107]. Defect
calculations also suggest that the main vacancies and anti-site
defects do not have transition levels resonant within the band
gap, or have high formation energy transition levels that
involve a large gradient change (which would have a low
capture cross-section) [285]. However, In is not stable in the
+1 oxidation state and tends to oxidize to the +3 oxidation
state. InI ﬁlms have been found to decompose under ambient
conditions within 3 h [107].
BiI3 thin ﬁlms have been synthesized by physical vapor
transport (PVT) [194], physical vapor deposition (PVD)
[286], and solution processing [287]. On the other hand, BiI3
single crystals can be obtained by the vertical Bridgman
method [288] similar to that was described in InI section.
It is worth noting that BiI3 tends toward dissociation at
250 °C–300 ℃[289, 290], which limits its synthesis to some
extent. BiI3 has indirect band gaps of around 1.7–1.8 eV with
large absorption coefﬁcients (>105 cm−1 above 2 eV) [194,
288]. BiI3 single crystals have demonstrated the electron
mobility as high as 260 cm2 V−1 s−1 (or 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1
with Sb doping) [195, 291], though the hole mobility was
estimated to be much lower due to relatively large effective
hole mass (2.01m0). Furthermore, a long electron diffusion
length of 4.9 μm estimated from the large mt product as well
as a PL lifetime of 1.3–1.5 ns was obtained from BiI3 single
crystals [194], indicating the potential of BiI3 as a great PV
material. BiI3 ﬁlms are also stable in air. For instance,
Hamdeh et al have demonstrated that they could stand against
oxidation for several months or withstand several hours of
annealing without degradation [287]. In addition, Du et al’s
work showed that the large Born effective charge of BiI3
could result in its large dielectric constant of around 54 [292],
which can Coulombically screen charged defects.
SbI3 single crystalline plates could be grown from vapor
phase [197] directly or by Bridgman method [293]. Particu-
larly, SbI3 microcrystals could be obtained by the incor-
poration with Y-zeolite faujasites via sublimation [293]. In
addition, Mohan et al also fabricated SbI3 ﬁlms by iodizing
evaporated Sb ﬁlms [294]. Kepinska et al showed that SbI3
has a temperature dependent indirect band gap [197], which is
around 2.1 eV at room temperature. Virko et al proved that
this band gap would be blue-shifted when the deposited SbI3
clusters
became
smaller,
which
implies
the
quantum
26
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewconﬁnement effect of this material [293]. BiI3 also demon-
strates rather large absorption coefﬁcients in visible region on
the order of 105–106 cm−1 [197]. However, SbI3 single
crystals were found to have an Urbach energy over 200 meV
at room temperature [197], indicating that several defect states
may exist within the band gap.
3.8. V–VI–VII materials
V–VI–VII materials are materials made from elements of V,
VI, and VII group, which may be Bi/Sb, O/S/Se, and
halides, respectively. Similar to binary halides, V–VI–VII
materials also have antibonding orbital character at the band-
edges along with strong SOC, which are therefore promising
for potentially exhibiting defect tolerance. At present, BiOI,
BiSI, and SbSI are the compounds studied the most. Both
BiOI and BiSI have a layered structure (matlockite tetragonal
system [199, 200]), where I–Bi–O/S–Bi–I layers are stacked
along the c-axis and linked by weak van der Waals interac-
tions (ﬁgure 13). On the other hand, SbSI has a needle-like
crystal structure with long chains growing along the (001)-
axis [295]. Strong anisotropy can be seen in V–VI–VII
materials due to their low dimensionality and may be reﬂected
in many features. For example, the effective hole mass can
differ by over 3 times as along different axes of BiOI [200],
which also leads to the anisotropy in its carrier transport.
BiOI polycrystalline thin ﬁlms can be fabricated by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [201, 296] or the SILAR
technique [297]. Owing to the 2D structure, BiOI thin ﬁlms
exhibit a textured morphology. For example, CVD BiOI
grown on solution-processed NiOx have a {012} preferred
orientation. It was recently shown that this could be con-
trolled through the vaporization temperature of the BiI3 pre-
cursor and the growth temperature, which inﬂuence whether
growth is nucleation or kinetically-dominated [298]. The
preferred orientation of BiOI ﬁlms can then be changed from
a/b-axis to c-axis, which results in a denser morphology.
BiOI has an indirect band gap of 1.8–1.9 eV with
absorption coefﬁcients larger than 104 cm−1 from UV to
visible range [201, 299]. Computed defect diagrams showed
that the defects with the lowest formation energy have shal-
low transition levels [201], which was consistent with
experiments. It has been showed that the electronic structure,
PL intensity and charge-carrier lifetime are robust against
percent-level defects [300]. Furthermore, a high dielectric
constant of 45 was found through computations [201], and
this can help to screen charged defects. The PL lifetime
measured was 2.7 ns [201]. Although this is sufﬁcient for
further exploration in solar absorbers [18], it is shorter than
the lifetime of lead-halide perovskites. Recently, photo-
induced current transient spectroscopy measurements showed
that BiOI ﬁlms have deep traps located at 0.3 and 0.6 eV from
the band-edge [300], but their origin have not yet been
identiﬁed. BiOI has improved air stability over lead-halide
perovskites, with no change in phase over the entire 197 d
testing period [201].
BiSI polycrystalline thin ﬁlms can be synthesized by
various methods such as single-precursor solution processing
[202], spray pyrolysis [301], asynchronous ultrasonic spray
pyrolysis (APUSP) [302], hydrothermal [303] and sol-
vothermal methods [304]. APUSP here used two ultrasonic
humidiﬁers to deliver two nebulized solution onto a hot
substrate subsequently to improve the ﬁlm morphology. On
the other hand, BiSI single crystals can be synthesized by a
gel process [305] or the sublimation of BiSI polycrystals
[203]. One key challenge of depositing BiSI ﬁlms is the
competition from other Bi–S–I phases [306], which is veriﬁed
from the isothermal section of this ternary system. BiSI has a
nearly direct band gap of around 1.6 eV with absorption
coefﬁcients of around 104 cm−1 in UV and visible range
[301]. Though the effective electron mass is small for BiSI
[202], Sasaki et al have shown that this material may exhibit
an electron drift mobility of only 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the c-
axis [203]. Moreover, Hahn et al also estimated a mean hole
diffusion length of only
´
-
5
10 6 cm [301], which arises
from its larger hole effective mass (0.95m0 [203]). In addition,
a short PL lifetime of about 1.03 ns was also obtained from
BiSI thin ﬁlms [202], implying the presence of deep-level
sulfur vacancies. BiSI is also a semiconductor exhibiting
ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity and photoconductivity, and
hence is an appealing material in various ﬁelds [307].
SbSI ﬁlms can be prepared by hydrothermal methods
[308] or simple solution processing methods [309]. In addi-
tion, SbSI single crystals can be synthesized via the vertical
Bridgman technique [310] or CVT [311]. Due to the aniso-
tropy of SbSI, it is still difﬁcult to fabricate large-area and
uniform single crystalline samples. SbSI has indirect band
gaps of around 2 eV [309, 312], which may be blue-shifted
when the temperature decreases [310]. The ferroelectricity of
SbSI also leads to the large static dielectric constant of the
order of 104 at 292 K [313], which is beneﬁcial for screening
charged defects. In addition to the ferroelectricity, SbSI also
has high photoconductivity and piezoelectricity [314] and is
as appealing as BiSI.
3.9. Strong electron–phonon interactions and self-trapped
excitons
Although Sn-based perovskites have demonstrated high
mobilities exceeding 500 cm2 V−1 s−1 in single crystals
[249], the mobilities of other PIMs are more modest. This is
partly due to reduced band dispersion in many cases, parti-
cularly in compounds with layered, 1D or 0D structures.
Another important factor, however, is electron–phonon cou-
pling. Charge carriers can couple with phonons (quanta of
lattice vibrations) via polarization of the lattice ions, inducing
a localized structural distortion. Meanwhile, the movement of
charge carriers can be constrained by these distortions, and
the term ‘polaron’ is used to describe the charge carrier
coupled to the crystal vibrations. It has been veriﬁed that
strong electron–phonon coupling occurs in A3B2X9 materials
[252], double perovskites [124, 315], and binary halides
[316]. Owing to the polar nature of these materials, Fröhlich
interactions are expected, in which charge-carriers couple to
longitudinal optical (LO) phonons [317]. Optical phonons
involve out-of-phase lattice movements, resulting in electric
27
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewﬁelds which interact with the charge-carrier via polarization
effects [318]. The strength of this electron–phonon coupling
is described by a dimensionless coupling constant, α, which is
given by equation (5) [319]:

In equation (5), q is the charge of an electron, the
reduced Planck constant, c the speed of light, mb the effective
mass of the charge-carrier in the absence of lattice interac-
tions, ωLO the rotational frequency of the longitudinal optical
phonon mode, and ε∞and ε0 the optical and static dielectric
constants, respectively [319]. A coupling constant larger than
2 is considered to be strong, with larger coupling constants
yielding increased polaron (carrier) effective masses, thereby
signiﬁcantly limiting the mobilities. In Cs2AgBiBr6 for
example, the Fröhlich coupling constant has been calculated
to be 2.54 for electrons and 2 for holes [315], showing the
presence of strong electron–phonon coupling in this double
perovskite material. This electron-lattice interaction can also
be quantiﬁed through the Huang–Rhys factor, S, which
indicates the average number of vibrations emitted after an
optical transition between excited and ground states [315].
The Huang–Rhys factor for Cs2AgBiBr6 has been measured
to be high, at 11.7–15.4 [315, 320]. As a result, the mobilities
of Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals have been measured to only
reach 11.81 cm2 V−1 s−1, well below lead- and tin-based
perovskites [133, 249]. Beyond reducing the mobility, Fröh-
lich interactions also result in a temperature-dependent
widening in the photoluminescence peak [317].
Similar to polarons, excitons are also quasiparticles that
can arise in semiconductor crystals, and which can have
signiﬁcant effects on optoelectronic behavior [321, 322].
Excitons are Coulombically-bound electron–hole pairs which
are produced by band-edge excitations. The attraction of the
oppositely-charged electron and hole results in a stabilization
of the excitonic state relative to that of free charge carriers,
termed the exciton binding energy (Eb).
The exciton binding energy (Eb) and diffusion length
(LD) are two closely-related parameters which are often used
to characterize excitonic behavior in materials [321–324].
Excitons with low Eb (on the order of kT) are termed Wan-
nier–Mott (or free) excitons and are relatively mobile in the
crystal, thus exhibiting large exciton diffusion lengths. On the
other hand, Frenkel excitons are those which exhibit high Eb
(approx. 100–1000 meV), extremely short diffusion lengths
and are typically conﬁned to a single unit cell, drastically
inhibiting charge transport.
For photocurrent applications (such as PV, photo-
detectors and photocatalysts) [325], excitons must ﬁrst be
dissociated into ‘free’ charge carriers to allow charge
extraction and current generation to occur [323, 326]. In
contrast, for photoluminescence applications (i.e. LEDs),
excitons can beneﬁt device performance by facilitating efﬁ-
cient radiative recombination [321]. Therefore, low binding-
energy, Wannier–Mott-type excitons are desirable in PV
devices (being readily dissociated into free carriers by thermal
energy), and these have been observed as the dominant
excitonic species in 3D lead-halide perovskites and silicon,
and co-exist with free carriers [326–328].
For PV materials with large Eb, such as organic semi-
conductors and low-dimensional perovskites, strategies to
overcome poor charge separation and transport must be
employed
in
order
to
maintain
device
performance
[322, 323, 329]. Often, the introduction of heterojunctions, to
facilitate exciton dissociation, and use of extremely thin
devices, to counteract the extremely-short LD, are necessary.
Beyond these effects, excitons can also affect absorption
properties, with highEbmaterials exhibiting an excito-
nicpeak in the optical absorption spectrum below the band
gap of the material.
While excitonic behavior has been well-studied in the lead-
halide perovskites, with low binding energies of a few meV at
room temperature observed, initial investigations of excitons in
PIMs have indicated larger binding energies in these systems,
primarily due to reductions in carrier effective mass, structural
dimensionality and/or dielectric screening. For instance, inves-
tigations of A3B2X9compounds with 0D crystal structures have
reported Eb values in the range of 170–370 meV, attributed to
carrier localization within the isolated [B2X9]3−bi-octahedra
[21, 254, 330, 331]. Lower binding energies of approx.
100–120 meV are witnessed for A3B2X9 materials exhibiting
two-dimensional crystal structures, e.g. K3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9
[21]. Wannier–Mott binding energies on the order of 100 meV
have also been calculated for vacancy-ordered double perovskites
(A2BX6materials)—speciﬁcally K2SnI6 in this case, which have
strong band dispersion despite being crystallographically zero-
dimensional, due to close-packing of the lattice [332, 333].
As with polarons, excitons may also interact with pho-
nons. This coupling is similar to electron–phonon coupling
discussed earlier in this subsection. Such interactions can
result in the exciton localizing in the lattice in the absence of
defects due to distortions in the lattice [334] (e.g. Jahn–Teller
distortions [124]). This is referred to as intrinsic self-trapping
(ﬁgure 18(a)). These self-trapped excitons (STEs) can be
considered to be defect states, but unlike lattice defects, STEs
are only created after excitation. Moreover, if the exciton
occurs in the vicinity of a permanent defect, it will form an
extrinsic STE that is trapped at different energies compared to
those of intrinsic STEs. Schematic images of three trapping
conditions are displayed in ﬁgure 18(a). As discussed above,
this behavior limits mobilities and acts as a loss channel for
photogenerated carriers. Multiple excited states relative to the
ground state will be also generated as coupling occurs, as
illustrated in ﬁgure 18(b). These excited states will exhibit a
large equilibrium position offset relative to the free exciton
(FC) state, and this offset is proportional to the Huang–Rhys
parameter. As a result, a broadband white light emission with
large Stokes shift is usually observed in the materials
[124, 335].
Beyond Cs2AgBiBr6, strong coupling has also been
identiﬁed in A3B2X9 materials. For example, Cs3Sb2I9 was
found to have a Huang–Rhys factor as high as 42.7. It is
proposed that this strong electron–phonon coupling resulted
in the formation of STEs and in turn gave the broad PL peaks

Cs2(Ag0.6Na0.4)InCl6 double perovskite [124] and observed
that its PL showed a linear dependence on the excitation
power with the PLQEs almost unchanged. This result veriﬁed
the existence of STEs since permanent defects will encounter
the saturation effect, where none of carrier transitions occurs
after all defect states are ﬁlled at high power excitations. They
also demonstrated that though Na ions could break the
inversion symmetry of Cs2AgInCl6 and improve the PLQE to
some extent, too many Na ions might force the excited states
to cross ground state, leading to non-radiative recombination
through phonon emission. Other important features regarding
white light emission have been investigated in low-dimen-
sional perovskites. For instance, Cortecchia et al indicated
that the white light emission intensity will increase at lower
temperature due to the thermal energy is not comparable to
the de-trapping energy (Ea,detrap in ﬁgure 18(b)), but it will
decrease when the temperature is down to below ∼80 K since
the thermal energy is even less than self-trapping energy
(Ea,trap in ﬁgure 18(b)). These materials featuring white light
emission with large Stokes shift will not suffer PL self-
absorption and thermal quenching, which are suitable for the
white light LED applications.
4. Engineering of photovoltaic devices—strategies
and challenges
Two common device structures are used: n-i-p and p-i-n. In
the n-i-p structure, the active layer is grown over an electron
transport layer (ETL) covering the transparent conducting
oxide. A hole transport layer (HTL) and a high-work function
top electrode is deposited over the active layer (vice versa for
p-i-n). These device structures can be divided into planar and
mesoporous structures. The planar structure only needs a
compact ETL, but the mesoporous structure uses a meso-
porous scaffold (typically comprised of TiO2 nanoparticles)
deposited on a thin compact ETL (TiO2 thin ﬁlm). The active
layer will then incorporate into the mesoporous scaffold,
which improves carrier transfer. These device structures are
illustrated in ﬁgure 19.
The stability of PV devices is a critical consideration for
commercial applications. However, publications usually lack
consistency in terms of testing procedures and parameters
reported. To resolve this issue, protocols have been developed
for stability testing. For commercial silicon solar cells, the
protocol IEC (International Electrochemical Commission)
61215-1-3:2016 is commonly used (refer to the Introduction)
[336]. At the lab level, protocols developed by the Interna-
tional Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) are
commonly used [337]. These were initially developed for
organic solar cells, but were more recently adopted for per-
ovskite solar cells as well. The ISOS protocols are categorized
into 5 stress conditions (dark storage testing, outdoor testing,
light soaking testing, thermal cycling testing, light-humidity-
thermal cycling testing). Additional testing procedures spe-
ciﬁc to perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as light-dark
cycling and testing under continuous bias in the dark, have
been added to these protocols. It is suggested that the stability
of PIM-based solar cells can be evaluated according to similar
protocols as well to resolve the large discrepancies in testing
procedures that are present in the literature.

Topical ReviewIn this section, we will ﬁrst brieﬂy review the progress of
lead-halide PSCs before focusing the discussion on PIM-
based photovoltaics. We discuss the architectures used in PV
devices of each class of PIMs, and the device performance
and stability achieved. Finally, an overview of the current
challenges and limiting factors will be presented.
4.1. Lead-halide perovskites
As mentioned in section 1, lead-halide PSCs have made
enormous progress, demonstrating rapid increases in PCE
after only a decade of research [6]. One of the factors driving
the rapid learning rate demonstrated in perovskite PVs is the
rapid evolution in device architecture.
In 2009, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 were used in a dye-
sensitized solar cell conﬁguration, with the halide perovskite
thought of as a replacement for the dye. These devices used a
liquid electrolyte solution (LiBr and Br2 dissolved in acet-
onitrile) [6]. However, this conﬁguration was hardly used
later due to the poor stability of lead-halide perovskites in
contact with the liquid electrolyte. Kim et al proposed a
mesoporous MAPbI3 PSC with a solid 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-
di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobiﬂuorene (spiro-OMe-
TAD) HTL [338]. This device not only showed an enhanced
PCE of 9.7%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V
and short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17 mA cm−2, but
also improved stability, with minimal change in the PCE after
500 h illumination under 1-sun in air. In the same year (2012),
Lee et al surprisingly found that a hybrid MAPbIxCl3−x PSC
with PCE over 10% can be achieved when replacing the
mesoporous TiO2 with an insulating mesoporous Al2O3
scaffold [339]. Their work indicated that electrons diffuse
faster in MAPbIxCl3−xthan in TiO2 and fewer sub-gap defect
states exist in Al2O3, which enables improvements in the JSC
and VOC of the device. Later, due to the discovery of fast
carrier transport and long diffusion lengths within lead-halide
perovskites [340], PSCs fabricated in either a p-i-n or n-i-p
structure with thicker (∼500 nm) perovskite layers were
intensively investigated. In 2013, Liu et al used dual-source
evaporation to fabricate a planar MAPbIxCl3−x PSC that
demonstrated a PCE of 15.4%, a VOC of 1.07 V, and a JSC of
21.5 mA cm−2 , indicating that the mesoporous scaffold is not
completely necessary for efﬁcient PV devices [341]. More
recently, in 2019, Yoo et al reported a solution-processed
(FAPbI3)0.92(MAPbBr3)0.08 PSC with a mesoporous scaffold,
and with the surface of the 3D perovskite passivated with a
layered perovskite, which resulted in PCEs of 23.4% along
with a record low VOC loss of only ∼0.34 V [342]. On the
other hand, Tang et al adopted [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM)/C60 and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-
1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) as the ETL and NiO nanocrystals
as the HTL to reduce the scattering loss in p-i-n MAPbI3
PSCs, which led to a PCE of 15.47%, a VOC of 1.06 V, and
JSC of 19.41 mA cm−2 [343]. It is worth mentioning that
although the lead-halide PSCs have shown comparable PCEs
to that of silicon solar cells, there is still signiﬁcance space for
further improvements in PCE.
To further increase the PCEs and overcome the SQ limit
for single-junction PSCs, perovskite-based tandem photo-
voltaics have gained attention. A perovskite tandem combines
one PSC as the top cell with another device as the bottom cell.
The bottom cell absorber needs to have a lower band gap Eg
than the perovskite used in the top cell (Eg of 1.55–1.8 eV
usually), and examples include crystalline Si (Eg of 1.1 eV)
[13, 344], copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) (Eg of
1.2 eV) [345, 346], PbS colloidal quantum dots (Eg∼
0.5–1.3 eV) [347, 348] or another lower-bandgap PSC
(Eg∼1.25 eV) [349, 350]. These devices allow higher PCEs
compared to single PSCs since the bottom cells can absorb
the photons with lower energy in the solar spectrum that
cannot be absorbed by lead-halide perovskites. The two sub-
cells can either have the top-cell mechanically stacked over
the bottom-cell (four-terminal tandem) or integrated together
into one device (two-terminal tandem). Since their ﬁrst report
in 2014 [351], perovskite-based tandems have made rapid
progress in terms of efﬁciencies. Chen et al reported four-
terminal Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45/Si tandems with
Figure 19. Illustration of the most common device structures used for perovskite-inspired materials.

Topical Reviewimproved surface morphology on the perovskite layer, and
achieved a PCE of 28.2% [347]. A PCE of up to 29.15% was
also reported in a two-terminal perovskite/Si tandem in
2020 [7].
Although perovskite
tandems have presented great
potential in terms of PCEs, the multiple layers incorporated in
these cells also lead to severe optical losses, such as due to
unwanted reﬂection between layers with large differences in
refractive index [352]. Therefore, light management techni-
ques, which are well-established in the modern semiconductor
industry, have been applied to perovskite/Si tandems. A
micron-scale pyramidal structure can be formed on the sur-
faces of the silicon bottom cells via chemical etching in order
to reduce reﬂection losses. This texturing can be adopted in a
two-terminal tandem by growing the perovskite top-cell
conformally over the textured silicon bottom cell, such as
through thermal evaporation [344]. Tandems textured on one
side or on both sides have been adopted and demonstrated
signiﬁcant improvement in efﬁciencies over planar tandems
[13, 344, 353]. Optical losses in tandems can also be achieved
through the use of light management foils (e.g. viscous lac-
quer fabricated by UV nanoimprinting lithography) or by
depositing anti-reﬂection coatings (e.g. LiF or MgF2) on the
front side of the top cell with optimal thickness. The appli-
cation of light management foils or antireﬂection coatings on
planar tandems has led to improvements in the PCE by 1.1%
and photocurrents by over 10% [354, 355].
It should be noted that the PCE of perovskite solar cells
has been shown to be dependent on the test method used (e.g.
scan direction and speed in the measurement of an I–V curve)
[356, 357]. One of the main causes of these deviations is the
facile ion conductivity of lead-halide perovskites, which
strongly contributes to hysteresis in I–V curve measurements.
Some of the factors inﬂuencing the degree of hysteresis
include the device architecture, thickness of TiO2, and scan
rate [356]. The origin of hysteresis of PSCs is still under
debate, but it has been shown that a bad solar cell can be
‘made to look good’ simply through improper testing meth-
ods (e.g. by taking fast reverse scans) [356, 358]. There has
therefore been signiﬁcant effort to identify how to reliably
measure the correct efﬁciency of a PSC, and to standardize
measurement and reporting protocols. For instance,
1. The stabilized power output should be recorded by
tracking the maximum power point of the device over
several minutes of continuous illumination.
2. The JSC calculated by integrating the incident photon to
current efﬁciency (IPCE) spectrum should not deviate
from the measured JSC by more than 20%.
3. Biasing a PSC at a voltage higher than VOC before a
J–V scan could lead to large measurement errors and
should be avoided.
It is worth mentioning that PV devices based on PIMs
may face similar issues as PSCs, and many researchers have
adopted the best practices developed for lead-halide per-
ovskite PSCs.
The toxicity of lead in lead-halide perovskites remains as
a potential issue for commercialization. We note that although
photovoltaics are exempt from the Restriction of Hazardous
Substances directive, the lead in perovskites is present in a
soluble form that may be easily accessible. To reduce the lead
leakage when modules are damaged or penetrated by water,
encapsulation may be the most widely employed approach. It
has been shown that perovskite modules encapsulated by
epoxy resin can effectively reduce the lead leakage rate down
to 0.08 mg h−1 m−2 under simulated sunny weather condi-
tions [359]. Alternatively, coating lead-adsorbing materials,
such as ﬁlms of P,P′-di(2-ethylhexyl)methanediphosphonic
acid (DMDP) on each side of PSCs, can also sequestrate more
than 96% of leaked lead [360]. In addition, recycling lead-
containing liquid solvent generated during PSC fabrication
has been shown to be a viable strategy. For instance, iron-
incorporated hydroxyapatite exhibits a strongly charged sur-
face that can effectively absorb lead ions in solvent, and the
magnetism introduced by iron enables the easy collection of
lead-absorbed products [361]. As a result, 99.7% of leaked
lead can be recycled.
4.2. Sn-based perovskites
PV devices with Sn-based perovskites have been fabricated in
the n-i-p (planar and mesoporous) and p-i-n structures. For the
planar structure, although the diffusion length of Sn-based
perovskites can be very long, it is still challenging to make
devices based on this structure owing to the requirement of
high ﬁlm quality (compact ﬁlm morphology and low pinhole
density). Trimethylamine (TMA) was found to be an additive
that can improve the ﬁlm quality of FASnI3, and a PCE of
4.34% with a VOC of 0.31 V, and a JSC of 21.65 mA cm−2 in
planar FASnI3 solar cells was achieved [362].
On the other hand, the most common architectures used in
Sn-based perovskite PV devices is the mesoporous structure.
The so-called hollow solar cells based on mesoporous structure
were found to demonstrate improved performance over planar
devices [113, 363]. In these devices, ethylenediammonium
(en) was incorporated to replace parts of A-site cations in Sn-
based perovskites, which would create several SnI2 vacancies
and change the electronic structures of perovskites. As a result,
hollow solar cells could demonstrate better ﬁlm morphology
and lower defect densities (estimated from the trap-ﬁlled lim-
ited voltage from SCLC measurement) compared to neat solar
cells, leading to an improved PCE and VOC. Consequently,
hollow {en}FASnI3, {en}MASnI3, and {en}CsSnI3 solar cells
have shown the highest PCE of 7.23%, 6.63%, and 3.79%,
respectively among mesoporous PV devices [113, 363].
Several p-i-n Sn-based perovskite solar cells have
demonstrated high PCEs. Shao et al fabricated p-i-n FASnI3
solar
cells
with
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-
styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the HTL and BCP as the
ETL, achieving a PCE of 9% with a VOC of 0.53 V, and a JSC
of 24.1 mA cm−2 [364]. Jiang et al also proposed p-i-n mixed
2D/3D PEAxFA1−xSnI3−x (PEA=C6H5CH2CH2NH3
+) solar
cells with indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) and PEDOT:PSS as
the ETL and HTL, respectively [119]. They showed that the
use of ICBA, which exhibits a lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) closer to the vacuum level compared to
31
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical ReviewPCBM, could effectively increase the VOC. Introducing
NH4SCN as an additive to the perovskite can help to reduce
defect densities as well. As a result, their champion device
showed a record PCE of 12.4% and VOC of 0.94 V along with
a JSC of 17.4 mA cm−2. It should be noted that simpler
devices without hole transport layers have also been reported.
For instance, HTL-free p-i-n CsSnI3 solar cells (with SnCl2
added to the perovskite to improve ﬁlm quality) demonstrated
a PCE of 3.56%, along with a high ﬁll factor of ∼70% [121].
The efﬁciency for Sn-based perovskite solar cells is
limited by nonradiative recombination (with carrier lifetimes
<1 ns for most thin ﬁlm samples) and unmatched band
alignment with common transport layers [19]. Other than
poor ﬁlm morphology during processing, the high recombi-
nation rate of Sn-based perovskites is mainly due to the
creation
of
Sn
vacancies
from
self-doping
(refer
to
section 3.1). Recently, it has been shown that the incorpora-
tion of additives such as enI2 and PEAI [229, 364] or using
high-impurity precursors might help to decrease the density of
these background recombination centers. On the other hand,
Sn-based perovskites have larger band mismatch to common
ETLs and HTLs compared to MAPbI3, as shown in ﬁgure 20.
This mismatch may impede the carrier extraction and cause
the recombination loss at the interface of the transport layers
and the perovskite layer, which will reduce VOC signiﬁcantly.
Searching for transport layers with suitable band-edges is
therefore important as fabricating Sn-based perovskite solar
cells.
Sn-based perovskite solar cells are unstable in air owing
to the oxidation of Sn2+, as discussed in section 3.1. Typi-
cally, neat Sn-based perovskite solar cells may completely
lose
their
initial
PCEs
in
air
within
a
few
hours
[229, 365, 366]. In addition to processing under an oxygen-
free or hydrazine-based atmosphere, many works have been
attempted a wide range of strategies to improve the stability
of Sn-based perovskites. For instance, the hollow structures
incorporated with en [229] or using TMA as additives have
been shown to enhance the air stability of FASnI3 [362].
Incorporation of the nonpolar guanidinium cations (GA+)
with 1% ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) as an addi-
tive can also enhance the moisture tolerance of FASnI3 [367].
Devices based on this hybrid Sn-based perovskite showed
almost no decrease in PCE after storage without encapsula-
tion in air with 20% relative humidity for 170 h. Furthermore,
an improvement in PCE was achieved when stored in a
N2-ﬁlled glovebox for 2000 h. Recently, solar cells composed
of 2D Sn-based perovskites were found to exhibit improved
ambient stability than their 3D counterparts. For example,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
PCE
of
2D
layered
(BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13
(BA:
butylammonium)
solar
cells
demonstrated less degradation than 3D MASnI3 in air [366].
However, the PCEs for most Sn-based perovskite solar cells
decrease signiﬁcantly after a few days in air unless proper
encapsulation is employed. By encapsulating devices with
glass and epoxy or glue under inner gas atmosphere, the
encapsulated cells could extend their device lifetimes up to a
few months [368].
4.3. Ge-based perovskite
Ge-based perovskite PV devices have been fabricated in the
mesoporous and p-i-n structures. Krishnamoorphy et al fab-
ricated various mesoporous Ge-based perovskite solar cells
by using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL [128]. However, the
PCEs of mesoporous CsGeI3 and MAGeI3 solar cells are
limited by their low VOC in the mV range, which is far below
the band gaps.
Champion Ge-based perovskite solar cells were based on
the p-i-n structure with PEDOT:PSS as HTL and PC70BM as
ETL. Kopacic et al showed that the efﬁciency and stability of
Figure 20. Energy diagram of Sn- and Pb-based perovskites along with some common ETLs and HTLs. Unit is in eV. The energy levels are
estimated from Tauc plots and photoemission spectroscopy in air. [19] John Wiley & Sons. © 2018 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

32
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewp-i-n structured MAGeI3 solar cells could be improved with
the substitution of a few percent of bromine [126]. Conse-
quently, the optimal device with MAGeI2.7Br0.3 demonstrated
a record PCE of 0.68% along with an improved VOC of
460 mV.
There are currently few reports of Ge-based perovskite
PV devices mainly due to their limited stability, as discussed
in section 3.2. Even MAGeI2.7Br0.3 solar cells with improved
stability still lose two-thirds of their initial performance in air
within a few hours after preparation [126]. It has also been
claimed that the formation of 2D perovskites with the addition
of bulky cations such as PEA+ [365] could be a promising
solution to address this issue.
Ge-based perovskite PV devices also suffer from low VOCs,
which limits PCEs, and which are arise in part due to the high
density of defect states during the oxidation of Ge2+. Improved
synthesis methods would be needed to address this issue, but the
poor solubility of some precursors in most polar organic solvents
is also a challenge that needs to be overcome. Krishnamoorthy
et al proposed that preparation methods without the addition of
hypophosphorous acid as well as the strict control of synthesis
environment and precursors may help improve the quality of
fabricated Ge-based perovskite ﬁlms [128].
4.4. Double perovskite
Most double perovskite solar cells investigated have used
Cs2AgBiBr6, while most groups reported only ∼1% PCE in
PV devices based on this material. However, the ﬁrst report of
this material in photovoltaics by Greul et al led to higher
PCEs of 2.43% and external quantum efﬁciencies (EQEs)
reaching 60% [239]. This was achieved through careful
optimization of the ﬁlm quality. Recently, Yang et al intro-
duced an N179 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(iso-
thiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′ dicarboxylato) ruthenium
(II)) interlayer between the active layer and spiro-OMeTAD
HTL, which could improve hole transfer and enhance light
absorption.
As
a
result,
the
optimized
mesoporous
Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cell exhibited a record PCE of 2.84% with
a VOC of 1.06 V and a JSC of 5.13 mA cm−2 [136]. On the
other hand, Gao et al showed that p-i-n Cs2AgBiBr6 solar
cells could also deliver a PCE of 2.23% with a VOC of 1.01 V
and a JSC of 3.19 mA cm−2 after using IPA as the anti-solvent
during ﬁlm synthesis [131], which resulted in smooth and
uniform
ﬁlms
with
micron-sized
grains.
In
addition,
Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells have demonstrated improved stability
in ambient air over Sn-, Ge- and Pb-based perovskites. The
stability of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells have been tested by storing
cells in the dark under ambient condition (temperature:
20 °C–30 °C, relative humidity: 40%–60% [236]), which is
actually consistent with the dark storage study in ISOS pro-
tocols (ISOS-D-1). Eventually, the optimal Cs2AgBiBr6 solar
cells showed no PCE degradation for at least 30 d.
As mentioned in section 3.3, the performance of double
perovskite devices is still signiﬁcantly limited by their
intrinsic optoelectronic properties (large band gaps and poor
carrier mobilities) and synthesis challenges (low solubility
precursors).
4.5. A3B2X9 materials
MA3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 are the two A3B2X9 materials that are
most commonly investigated in reports of defect-ordered
perovskite PVs. MA3Bi2I9 devices are generally based on the
mesoporous structures with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL.
Most PV devices, however, have demonstrated very low
PCEs, which are believed to be related to the poor ﬁlm
morphology of MA3Bi2I9, in addition to the high exciton
binding energy and large effective masses. Many investiga-
tors have worked on improving the ﬁlm morphology. Zhang
et al fabricated MA3Bi2I9 ﬁlms via a two-step approach with
the BiI3 ﬁlms evaporated under high vacuum and transformed
into MA3Bi2I9 ﬁlms under a low vacuum MAI atmosphere
[369]. Their MA3Bi2I9 solar cells consist of the compact,
pinhole-free, and large-grained ﬁlms, demonstrating a PCE of
1.64% with a Voc of 0.81 V and a JSC of 2.95 mA cm−2. Jain
et al further optimized the MA3Bi2I9 ﬁlm quality via the
vapor assisted solution process by exposing solution-pro-
cessed BiI3 ﬁlms to MAI vapors, and replaced spiro-OMe-
TAD with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the
HTL [148]. A PCE of 3.17% with a VOC of 1.01 V and a JSC
of 4.02 mA cm−2 was achieved in their champion solar cells.
Similarly, most Cs3Bi2I9 PV devices were fabricated
based on the mesoporous structure as well. The PCEs of these
devices were also low due to their relatively low photo-
currents. Ghosh et al showed that the photocurrents of
Cs3Bi2I9 solar cells could be enhanced when the precursor
solution was prepared with excess BiI3, which may passivate
the deep-level defects of Cs3Bi2I9 [370]. They investigated
the inﬂuence of different structures (planar and p-i-n), along
with the mesoporous solar cells with different HTLs, while
none of the PCEs of these devices exceeded 1%. A PCE of
0.21% with a VOC of 0.49 V and a JSC of 0.67 mA cm−2 was
achieved in their best device. A breakthrough was made by
Bai et al [151]. They reported a dissolution-recrystallization
method to fabricate high-quality Cs3Bi2I9 ﬁlms. In this
method, the mixed DMF/CH3OH solvent, which can thor-
oughly dissolve Cs3Bi2I9 and evaporate, will be dropped onto
the annealed as-deposited Cs3Bi2I9 ﬁlms, and the ultrathin
Cs3Bi2I9
nanoplates
will
recrystallize
after
the
second
annealing. Eventually, the devices with CuI as the HTL
achieved a record PCE of 3.2% with a signiﬁcantly improved
JSC of 5.78 mA cm−2, which is ascribed to the smaller grains
and voids within fabricated ﬁlms.
Sb-based A3B2X9 material solar cells also drew the
attention of many researchers due to their higher dimension-
ality (2D) compared to Bi-based counterparts (0D), which
could lead to improved mobilities. In particular, Cs3Sb2I9 can
be 0D or 2D depending on the synthesis method (refer to
section 3.5). Cs3Sb2I9 solar cells have been fabricated based
on n-i-p or p-i-n structures. Umar et al deposited high-quality
2D Cs3Sb2I9 ﬁlms by using IPA as an antisolvent and intro-
ducing HCl additive into the precursor solutions, which can
decrease the reaction time and suppress the formation of Sb–
I–Sb clusters [157]. HTL-free planar Cs3Sb2I9 solar cells with
only TiO2 as the ETL were realized with a PCE of 1.21%,
VOC of 0.61 V and a JSC of 3.55 mA cm−2. By contrast, 0D
33
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical ReviewCs3Sb2I9 devices with a similar structure only obtained a PCE
of 0.43%. Sign et al fabricated p-i-n 2D Cs3Sb2I9 solar cells
with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as the ETL [156], achieving
a PCE of 1.49% with a VOC of 0.72 V and a JSC of
5.31 mA cm−2. On the other hand, p-i-n 0D Cs3Sb2I9 solar
cells exhibited a larger VOC (0.77 V) while much smaller
JSC (2.96 mA cm−2) and PCE (0.89%), which is mainly
ascribed to the larger band gaps of 0D Cs3Sb2I9. Alter-
natively, Peng et al demonstrated mesoporous 0D Cs3Sb2I9
solar cells with poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-isphenyl)
benzidine (poly-TPD) as the HTL [250] could only achieve a
low PCE of 0.24%. However, the incorporation of Cl was
found to convert 0D Cs3Sb2I9 into 2D Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x, and
mesoporous 2D Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x solar cells (with LZ-HTL-1-1
as the HTL) showed a signiﬁcantly improved PCE of 2.15%
with a VOC of 0.6 V and a JSC of 6.46 mA cm−2. Addition-
ally, some promising results have been obtained with
Rb3Sb2I9 solar cells. Weber et al deposited single crystallite
Rb3Sb2I9 thin ﬁlms by using the antisolvent vapor diffusion
crystallization method [165], where single crystals could
grow as the antisolvent was evaporated and condensed onto
the coated precursor solutions. A PCE of 1.37% and peak
EQE of 26% was achieved in their champion mesoporous
Rb3Sb2I9 with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. They also found
that the incorporation of Br led to a preferred orientation of
Rb3Sb2Br9−xIxﬁlms parallel to the substrate, which would
impede carrier transport. Recently, Li et al employed high
temperature annealing under SbI3 atmosphere to improve the
morphology of Rb3Sb2I9 ﬁlms and increase the grain size
[161]. Based on the planar structure with poly(N,N′-bis-4-
butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine
(poly-TPD)
as
the
HTL, optimized Rb3Sb2I9 solar cells from Li et al’s study
demonstrated a comparable PCE (1.35%) but a much higher
peak EQE (65.4%), which was attributed to the improved
mobilities and reduced defects in the devices.
As discussed in section 3.5, most PV devices based on
A3B2X9 materials are stable in air. For instance, the stability
of Rb3Sb2I9 solar cells have been tested by storing cells in the
dark under inert gas atmosphere, which is consistent with the
suggested protocol ISOS-D-1I for PSCs [337]. As a result, the
PCE of Rb3Sb2I9 solar cells could retain 84% of their initial
values after 150 d [165]. However, planar Cs3Bi2I9 solar cells
with CuI and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL were found to
maintain only 57% and 28% of their initial PCEs, respectively
after storing in a constant temperature-humid chamber
(temperature: 25 °C, relative humidity: 45%) for 38 d [151],
which implies that the device stability may be inﬂuenced by
the interactions between transport layers and active layers.
The factors limiting the performance of A3B2X9 material-
based devices are the wide band gaps, high exciton binding
energies, poor ﬁlm morphology, and the presence of deep
defects. As discussed in section 3.5, wide band gaps and high
exciton binding energies can lead to weak absorption and
poor carrier extraction, respectively. Though some works
have attempted to tune the band gaps by mixing different
halides with A3B2X9 materials at different proportions [144],
there are not yet sufﬁciently promising results reported. In
addition, high exciton binding energies are partly due to the
lower dimensionality of A3B2X9 materials, and synthesis
routes which can convert 0D structure into 2D counterpart for
some materials (e.g. Cs3Sb2I9) may help to address this issue.
Finally, many researchers have managed to resolve the latter
two issues via various processing techniques. Shin et al also
proposed a general method to fabricate compact thin ﬁlms of
most Bi-based A3B2X9 precursors [371], which involves the
use of solvent complexes to increase the solubility of Bi-
based precursors and a subsequently rapid nucleation process
via an antisolvent dripping. It should be noted that ﬁlm
orientation should be taken into account as well when
developing synthesis routes since strong anisotropy can be
seen in A3B2X9 materials.
4.6. ABZ2 materials
ABZ2-based PV devices can be fabricated as n-i-p or p-i-n
structures. Nanocrystals of ABZ2 could also be mounted onto a
mesoporous scaffold, giving a sensitized structure. At present,
devices based on CuSbS2, CuSbSe2, and AgBiS2 are investi-
gated most. Although some early progress has been made in
NaBiS2 and NaSbS2 quantum dot sensitized solar cells
[166, 168, 170], investigations into both materials are still rare.
CuSbS2 PV devices were largely fabricated based on the
p-i-n and mesoporous structures. p-i-n CuSbS2 solar cells
typically used Mo as the HTL and ZnO as the ETL with a
CdS buffer layer between CuSbS2 and ZnO to form a type-II
staggered heterojunction and promote carrier separation
[277]. Septina et al prepared puriﬁed CuSbS2 ﬁlms with the
precursors preheated before sulfurization, fabricating p-i-n
CuSbS2 solar cells achieving a PEC of 3.1% with a VOC of
0.49 V and a JSC of 14.73 mA cm−2 [178]. Banu et al
demonstrated p-i-n CuSbS2 solar cells prepared from hybrid
inks [179]. The cells they made showed a record PCE of
3.22% with a VOC of 0.47 V and a JSC of 15.64 mA cm−2.
Mesoporous CuSbS2 solar cells were found to exhibit com-
parable PV performance compared to that of p-i-n solar cells.
Chio et al fabricated mesoporous CuSbS2 solar cells with
poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]
dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)) (PCPDTBT) as
the HTL, achieving a PCE of 3.1% with a VOC of 0.34 V and
a JSC of 21.5 mA cm−2 [372].
On the other hand, almost all the CuSbSe2 solar cells
were built in the p-i-n structure by using Mo or Mo/MoOx
and ZnO (with CdS buffer layers) as the HTL and ETL,
respectively. Although there are fewer reports of CuSbSe2 PV
devices than CuSbS2 devices, CuSbSe2 PV devices have
achieved higher performance. Yang et al optimized the
morphology and crystalline orientation of hydrazine solution
processed CuSbSe2 ﬁlm by tuning the annealing temperature
[185]. However, CuSb(Se,S)2 usually occur due to the reac-
tion with competitive phases. As a result, the optimal
CuSb(Se0.96S0.04)2 solar cells only showed a PCE of 2.7%.
Welch et al controlled the evaporation ﬂux ratio of Sb2Se3
and Cu2Se to form pure phase CuSbSe2 ﬁlms, but found a
trade-off between JSC and VOC exists in CuSbSe2 solar cells
[186]. It has been shown that as the Sb2Se3/Cu2Se ratio
34
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewincreased, the JSC would be enhanced due to the extended
depletion width, while the VOC would be suppressed owing to
the reduced hole concentration (and hence the reduced quasi
Fermi level splitting). Consequently, the highest PCE of 4.7%
along with a VOC of 0.336 V and a JSC of 26 mA cm−2 were
achieved in their devices.
In addition to competitive impurity phases and the
JSC-VOC trade-off for CuSbSe2 solar cells, lower JSC arising is
a common challenge for CuSbS2 and CuSbSe2 solar cells.
This could be attributed to the strong absorption losses of CdS
buffer layer [283], which leads to a signiﬁcant drop in the
short wavelength range below 520 nm. Moreover, CdS layers
are known to have some detrimental effects, such the intro-
duction of deep hole defects [373]. Nevertheless, none of PV
devices with CdS being replaced by other materials have
shown promising performance to date.
Most AgBiS2 solar cells were fabricated as the planar
structure with ZnO as the ETL and P3HT or poly[[4,8-bis[(2-
ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-
ﬂuoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]
(PTB7) as the HTL. Bernechea et al displayed AgBiS2
nanocrystal solar cells achieving a PCE of 6.3% with a VOC of
0.45 V and a JSC of 22 mA cm−2 [264]. The cells in this work
also demonstrated high stability in air with the PCE almost
unchanged under ambient condition for up to four months.
Recently, Burgues-Ceballos et al have shown that the AgBiS2
nanocrystal sizes can be enlarged by using the double-step
hot-injection technique [177], making thin ﬁlms with higher
carrier mobilities and lower defect densities. As a result, their
champion AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cell exhibited a PCE of
6.4%, a VOC of 0.46 V along with an improved JSC of 22.68
mA cm−2, which can be ascribed to better carrier extraction in
this device.
Incomplete current collection is one of the main chal-
lenges for AgBiS2 solar cells, which could be conﬁrmed by
the nonlinear dependence of JSC of on light intensity [264].
Improvements in the ligands used or the surface passivation
of the nanocrystals would be needed to suppress the trap
recombination during carrier transport.
4.7. Binary halides
Apart from BiI3, binary halides have not yet been investigated
much into PV devices. Most BiI3-based PV devices were
fabricated based on the planar structure. Hamdeh et al used
TiO2 and V2O5 as the ETL and HTL [287], respectively, and
found that the devices processed in air showed better per-
formance than those in a glovebox, which is attributed to the
facilitated hole transport due to the formation of BiOI layers.
Moreover, solvent vapor annealing could also improve ﬁlm
quality and boost the PCE of PV devices. A PCE of 1.02%
with a VOC of 364 mV and a JSC of 7 mA cm−2 were dis-
played in their work. Tiwari et al showed that using HTLs
with higher ionization potential such as poly(9,9-di-noctyl-
ﬂuorenyl-2,7-diyl) (F8) can exhibit better match to the VBM
of BiI3, raising the VOC of PV devices [196]. As a result, their
champion planar BiI3 solar cell demonstrated a slightly
improved PCE of 1.21% along with a record VOC of 0.607 V.
Additionally, hole extraction also plays an important role in
determining PCEs of BiI3-based PV devices, which could be
seen from the substantial inﬂuence of the HTL on device
performance. Searching for HTLs with matched energy levels
is thus crucial for BiI3-based PV devices. Furthermore, the
softness of the material makes it challenging to handle
without scratching the ﬁlm and causing pinholes to occur
[374]. Finally, BiI3 devices have exhibited improved stability
over Sn-, Ge- and Pb-based perovskites. It has been veriﬁed
that mesoporous BiI3 solar cells stored in ambient air with a
relative humidity of 50%, which is also consistent with the
test requirement of the protocol ISOS-D-1, can retain above
90% of their initial PCEs for over 30 d [375]. In addition,
these cells could also maintain ∼70% of their initial PCEs and
showed mineral change in their J–V curves after the heat
stress (temperature: 100 ℃in ambient air, similar to the
environment requirement of the protocol ISOS-D-2 with a
higher temperature) for 2 h and light-soaking test (by a solar
simulator, consistent with the environment requirement of the
protocol ISOS-L-1) for 20 min, respectively [375].
Recently, planar InI solar cells with CdS and P3HT as the
ETL and HTL, respectively, were reported by Mitzi’s group
[107]. SnI2 was used as an interface modiﬁcation layer
between the CdS and InI layer to control the preferred
orientation of InI ﬁlms. Eventually, a PCE of 0.39% with a
VOC of 450 mV and a JSC of 2.14 mA cm−2 were demon-
strated in the champion cell. Although Brandt et al have
showed that InI predominantly forms shallow defects [18],
Dunlap-Stohl et al indicated that the weak PL emission from
InI-based PV devices suggests the presence of non-radiative
recombination centers [107]. In addition, signiﬁcant hyster-
esis was also observed in InI-based PV devices [107].
Improvements in the performance of InI devices will require
further understanding of the composition and role of defects
in this material, as well as control over the oxidation of In+ to
In3+.
4.8. V–VI–VII materials
V–VI–VII materials have been applied as photocatalysts
(refer to section 5.2), but have gained increasing attention for
solar absorber applications more recently. Owing to their
original application in photocatalysts, early BiOI solar cells
were fabricated as liquid-state sensitized architectures with
iodide redox couple as electrolytes. However, most devices
showed very low efﬁciencies. Zhang et al deposited BiOI
ﬂakes onto mesoporous TiO2 as the working electrodes, but
their devices only reached 0.38% efﬁciently [376]. Sfaelou
et al replaced mesoporous TiO2 with a compact layer of TiO2
and fabricated BiOI solar cells with a PCE over 1% and a VOC
of 0.61 V [297]. Recently, Hoye et al demonstrated solid-state
BiOI solar cells with a p-i-n structured comprising of NiOx
and ZnO as the HTL and ETL, respectively [201]. A record
PCE of 1.8% with a VOC of 0.75 V and a JSC of 7 mA cm−2
was achieved in the champion device. They showed that the
band bending caused by the energy level mismatch (ﬁgure 21)
between BiOI and the HTL could introduce unwanted energy
barriers to hole collection. From this, they claimed that future
35
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewprogress on performance could be made by ﬁnding HTLs
with deeper work functions [201]. Furthermore, BiOI has a
layered structure with anisotropic carrier transport. The CVD
BiOI grown on solution-processed NiOx by Hoye et al had an
{012} preferred orientation, which allowed the top and bot-
tom electrodes to be connected by the high-mobility planes.
This enabled effective charge extraction, with a peak EQE up
to 80% at 450 nm wavelength [201]. At the same time, the
ﬁlms had an open structure, which limited the shunt resist-
ance. It was later shown the preferred orientation of the BiOI
platelets grown by CVD could be controlled through the
temperature of the BiI3 precursor and the temperature of the
substrate [298], as discussed in section 3.8. Growing c-axis
oriented BiOI platelets resulted in compact ﬁlm morphology,
which improved the VOC from 0.7 V (a/b-axis oriented) to
0.9 V (c-axis oriented).
Owing to the n-type characteristic of BiSI, Hahn et al
combined BiSI ﬁlms with p-type CuSCN to make single
junction solar cells [377]. They tested the PV performance of
BiSI/CuSCN solar cells immersed in the electrolyte con-
taining iodide compounds and achieved a 0.25% PCE.
However, the poor charge separation and transport within
BiSI ﬁlms led to an abnormal I–V curve in their devices,
where dark currents increased slowly under reverse bias. In
addition, solid-state BiSI/CuSCN solar cells were also fab-
ricated, but a small PCE of only 0.012% was reached, which
was mainly ascribed to scattering losses from CuSCN layer as
well as non-radiative recombination within the BiSI layer. It
is worth mentioning that though they attempted to introduce
Se-dope BiSI ﬁlms to reduce the band gaps, this resulted in a
reduction in the performance, possibly due to increased defect
densities. Recently, Tiwari et al fabricated planar BiSI solar
cells with SnO2 and F8 serving as the ETL and HTL,
respectively [202]. A PCE of 1.32% with a VOC of 0.445 V
and a JSC of 8.44 mA cm−2 was obtained from their
optimized device. It was claimed that one key challenge is the
presence of other Bi–S–I phases in the ﬁlms [306]. Moreover,
BiSI devices also suffer from short carrier lifetime due to the
presence of deep defects [378] and poor carrier transport,
which arises from the strong anisotropy of BiSI ﬁlms [202].
Nie et al used CBD to fabricate mesoporous SbSI solar
cells which demonstrated a PCE up to 3.05% along with a
VOC of 0.58 V and a JSC of 9.11 mA cm−2 [309]. Their great
success was attributed to the use of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-
ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7
(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPBTBT) as the HTL, which can
not only transport holes effectively but also harvest light not
absorbed by SbSI. Mesoporous SbSI solar cells in this work
retained over 93% of their initial PCEs after 15 d of storage
under ambient condition in the dark. Similar stability could be
maintained even under highly humid condition (humidity:
60%). Choi et al demonstrated planar SbSI solar cells fabri-
cated by a simple solution processing method [206], which
may help resolve the issues of CBD-synthesized SbSI ﬁlms
such as the formation of impurity phases and an uncontrol-
lable Sb/S ratio. However, the best planar SbSI solar cell only
showed a PCE of 0.93% with a VOC of 0.548 V and a JSC of
5.45 mA cm−2. Recently, Nie et al proposed a vapor pro-
cessing method, where more uniform SbSI ﬁlms could form
when CBD-processed Sb2S3 were annealed under vaporized
SbI3 atmosphere [205]. As a result, a record PCE of 3.62%
along with a VOC of 0.6 V and a JSC of 9.62 mA cm−2 was
achieved
in
their
mesoporous
SbSI
solar
cells
(with
PCPDTBT as the HTL). Compared to the CBD-processed
solar cells, the vapor processed solar cells exhibited better
crystallinity (stronger XRD peaks), lower series resistance,
and better stability (vapor-processed cells could maintain 91%
of their initial PCEs while CBS-processed cells would lose
over 70% of theirs after 3 h under illumination) which is due
to the compactness of the fabricated ﬁlms. In this study, they

Topical Reviewalso used halide treatment on Sb2S3 ﬁlms to passivate surface
defects and form thin SbSI layers above (ﬁgure 22). It has
been claimed that these SbSI thin ﬁlms can exert an external
driving force to promote the carrier transport. The optimized
mesoporous SbSI-interlayered Sb2S3 solar cell demonstrated
a high PCE of 6.08% with a VOC of 0.62 V and a JSC of
14.92 mA cm−2.
4.9. Overview of perovskite-inspired materials in photovoltaics
Figure 23 illustrates the highest PCEs and corresponding VOC
reported in various PIM-based PV devices discussed in this
Review. For comparison, the highest values for Pb-based PSC
((FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05) reported in literature (not the
record value) is also plotted [342]. These are compared to the
SQ limit for different band gaps, along with the radiative limit
in the VOC. It can be seen from ﬁgure 23(a) that except for Sn-
based perovskites, all the other PIMs exhibited efﬁciencies
below 25% of SQ limit. Furthermore, the VOC of the PIM
devices are well below their radiative limits (ﬁgure 23(b)).
This is due to a combination of non-radiative recombination
(due to traps or possibly self-trapped excitons in some cases),
high Urbach energies, or shunting due to a sub-optimal
morphology. There is therefore great room for improvements
in PIM-based PV devices through the identiﬁcation of new
classes of materials that could tolerate defects and engineering
the quality of the thin ﬁlms grown.
Stability is always an important consideration for PV
devices, and several devices based on PIMs such as double
perovskites and V–VI–VII materials have shown improved
stability over Pb-based perovskites. Aside from the intrinsic
stability of PIMs, it has been shown that the adoption of
transport layers in these devices can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the stability of the device itself. Therefore, many researches
are now aiming to improve PIM device stability by introdu-
cing speciﬁc additives or through careful choice of the
transport layers. We are thus looking forward to seeing more
investigations on the PIM device stability by following spe-
ciﬁc protocols soon.
5. Broader applications of perovskite-inspired
materials
There is a strong overlap between the required properties of
solar absorbers with the ideal properties of materials in wide
range of other types of electronics. For example, strong
absorption of visible light, long transport lengths and low
dark currents are also needed in radiation detectors, photo-
catalysts and memristors. This section explores the opportu-
nities in applying lead-free PIMs beyond PVs and the new
insights into the materials that could be gained in doing so.

Topical Review5.1. Light-emitting applications
Luminescence is one of the critical properties that inﬂuences
the performance of materials in photovoltaics through the
open-circuit voltage [49]. It follows that efﬁcient photo-
voltaics with a direct allowed band gap are promising can-
didates
for
light-emission
applications.
This
has
been
particularly well demonstrated in III–V materials [379], and
more recently with lead-halide perovskites [380, 381]. There
are two common applications of emitters: (1) phosphors, in
which the active layer is optically excited and spontaneously
emits; and (2) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in which elec-
trons and holes are injected into the active layer, where they
radiatively recombine to give electroluminescence (EL). For
both applications, one of the most important properties of the
emitter is the photoluminescence quantum efﬁciency (PLQE),
which quantiﬁes the percentage of recombination events that
are radiative (refer to [381] for more details of the other
properties inﬂuencing the efﬁciency of LEDs). LHPs have
now achieved PLQEs approaching 100% across a variety of
emission wavelengths [382–384]. Green-, red- and near-
infrared-emitting perovskite LEDs have now also achieved
external quantum efﬁciencies (EQEs) >20% [380, 384, 385].
Critically, pure-halide perovskites have demonstrated low
Urbach energies <30 meV, and the FWHM of the PL and EL
peaks are <30 nm [49, 386]. This is narrower than achievable
in typical organic and inorganic emitters, and the high color
saturation, coupled with the ability to tune the emission over
the entire color gamut, makes both perovskite phosphors and
LEDs
highly
suited
for
ultra-high
deﬁnition
displays
[387, 388]. But there is a strong motivation to ﬁnd lead-free
alternatives for display and lighting applications, owing to
regulations limiting the lead content in electrical products
(e.g. to a maximum of 0.1 wt% by the European Restriction
of Hazardous Substances Directive [389]).
Lead-free perovskite-inspired materials, however, have
not been close in matching the performance and color-purity
of LHPs [381, 390–393]. One of the main reasons is the low
PLQEs of most lead-free materials, many of which have
indirect band gaps (refer to section 3). But an important
exception to the low luminescence in perovskite-inspired
materials are A3B2X9 nanocrystals. These include Cs3Sb2Br9
nanocrystals (46%–51.2% PLQE at 410 nm wavelength
[394, 395]) and Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals (19.4% PLQE at 410
nm wavelength [396]). The latter has been used as blue-
phosphors, optically-excited with a UV-emitting GaN LED.
These phosphors were combined with a broad-emitting
Y3Al5O2 (YAG) phosphor to achieve white-light emission,
with Commission Internationale de l’éclairage (CIE) coordi-
nates of (0.29, 0.30) (close to the (0.33, 0.33) coordinates for
pure white) and a cool color temperature of 8477 K [396]. An
important advantage of Cs3Bi2Br9 is that it forms a passi-
vating shell of BiOBr, which improves its stability against
moisture and acid. As a result, Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals could
be mixed with tetraethyl orthosilicate and react with HBr and
water to form a nanocrystal-silica composite. This composite
encapsulated the nanocrystals, resulting in improved stability
under UV lighting (retaining 72% of the PL after 16
continuous UV illumination), and under heat stress (retaining
75% of the PL after 16 h continuous heating at 60°C [396]).
Similar results were achieved with the vacancy-ordered per-
ovskite Cs2SnCl6. This perovskite is advantageous over reg-
ular tin-based perovskites because the tin cation is already in
the more stable +4 oxidation state. By doping with bismuth, a
PLQE of 78.9% could be achieved, with a blue emission
wavelength of 455 nm. Cs2SnCl6:Bi was combined with
yellow phosphors (Ba2Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ and GaAlSiN3:Eu2+)
and excited with a UV GaN LED, giving white emission with
CIE coordinates of (0.36, 0.37) and a color temperature of
4486 K [397].
Lead-free double perovskites have also been demon-
strated as white-light-emitting phosphors. The materials
investigated have been Cs2A(I)B(III)Cl6, in which A(I) is
Ag+ or Na+ (or a mixture of both), and A(III) is In3+ or Bi3+
or a mixture of both. White-light emission from these mate-
rials stems from broad luminescence below the optical band
gap. Cs2AgBiCl6 has a wide indirect band gap [130], whereas
Cs2NaInCl6 has a direct, parity-forbidden band gap [240],
across which absorption is forbidden but PL could still occur.
Alloying In into Cs2AgBiCl6 resulted in a broad orange
luminescence peak below the optical band gap of Cs2AgBiCl6
appearing. This was attributed to the formation of a lower
parity-forbidden band gap after alloying with In, from which
luminescence occurred with a PLQE up to 36.6% with 90%
In addition [398]. Sub-band gap emission in Cs2NaInCl6 was
attributed to self-trapped excitons. Undoped Cs2NaInCl6 has
no luminescence, which was believed to be due to the self-
trapped excitons being dark. Alloying with Ag+ improved the
PLQE to 31.1% [399]. Alloying Cs2(Ag0.6Na0.4)InCl6 with
0.04% Bi further increased the PLQE to 86±5%, with broad
emission centered at 570 nm wavelength [124]. On the other
hand, Cs2NaInCl6 alloyed with Bi3+ remained dark, with only
blue PL due to free excitons. But broad yellow emission was
achieved through alloying with Mn2+, with a PLQE of 44.6%
being achieved, and this was attributed to the dark self-trap-
ped exciton transferred to an excited state of Mn2+ [400].
Cs2(Ag0.6Na0.4)InCl6:Bi3+ was used as white-light phos-
phors, owing to its high white-light PLQE. With excitation
from a GaN LED, emission with CIE coordinates of (0.396,
0.448) was achieved with a color temperature of 4054 K.
Critically, the double perovskite was air stable, and even more
so when encapsulated with silica. As a result, the emission
was stable after 1000 h of illumination in air [124].
Currently, there is only a handful of reports of EL from
PIMs, and most are on Sn-based perovskites. Lai et al
reported near-infrared LEDs from MASnI3, which emitted at
945 nm wavelength, but with EQEs only reaching 0.72%
[401]. An important limitation was the low PLQE of 5.3%
[401]. Rand et al subsequently improved the EQE to 5.0% (at
917 nm EL wavelength) by alloying Pb with Sn and intro-
ducing a long-chain organoammonium iodide ligand to the
precursor solution. The inclusion of the ligand resulted in
smaller grains with passivated surfaces [402]. Ruddlesden–
Popper tin-based perovskites have also been investigated, but
an early investigation into 2D phenethylammonium tin iodide
resulted in inefﬁcient red-emitting devices (0.15 cdm−2
38
Nanotechnology 32 (2021) 132004
Topical Reviewluminance and 0.03cdA−1 current efﬁciency [403]). Sub-
sequently, Rogach et al investigated tin-based Ruddlesden–
Popper perovskites with bromide as the halide, and oley-
lammonium as the A-site cation. They were able to directly
inject into the self-trapped exciton, resulting in broad orange
sub-band gap EL (centered at 620 nm), with 0.1% EQE and
350 cdm−2 luminance [404]. Notably, a PLQE of 88% was
achieved in colloidal suspensions, and 68% in thin ﬁlms
[404]. Beyond these tin-based perovskites, there has recently
been a demonstration of Sb-based LEDs. Shan et al achieved
violet EL from Cs3Sb2Br9 (408 nm wavelength) with an EQE
of 0.2%. The PLQE of the Cs3Sb2Br9 quantum dots was
51.2%, and the quantum dots were stable against heat, UV
illumination and moisture. In particular, the LEDs retained
90% of their initial EL intensity after 6 h of operation at 7 V
(∼70 mAcm−2 current density [394]). This is more stable
than their Sn- and Pb-based perovskite counterparts. But the
FWHMs of all tin- and antimony-based emitters discussed
here are signiﬁcantly wider than their lead-based counterparts,
typically 50–100 nm [394, 401–403]. This makes them less
competitive for display applications, compared to quantum
dot, organic and inorganic LEDs already commercially

5.2. Photocatalysis
Leaves absorb sunlight to convert CO2 and water to sugar and
oxygen through photosynthesis. Similarly, semiconductors
can absorb sunlight to enable the production of fuels, pre-
cursors for value-added products, or the degradation of
organic contaminants through photocatalysis [405, 406]. The
production of H2 from water was ﬁrst achieved by Fujishima
et al in 1969, in which TiO2 was used to absorb UV light.
Holes generated in TiO2 oxidized water to O2 gas, while the
electrodes transferred to the Pt counter electrode reduced H+
to H2 [407, 408]. This spurred several decades of research
into semiconductor-based photocatalysis, and was motivated
both by the promise of the clean solar-to-chemical energy
conversion, as well as the limitations of TiO2 in only being
able to absorb a small part of the solar spectrum due to its
wide band gap [405, 406, 409]. The materials and devices
structures for photocatalysis, as well as the operating princi-
ples, are reviewed in [405, 406, 409, 410]. The requirements
for the semiconductor are: (1) good light absorption, (2) high
chemical stability in the presence of the electrolyte, (3) sui-
table band-edge positions for enabling the redox reactions
required, (4) efﬁcient charge transport, and (5) to be low-cost.
Requirements 1, 4 and 5 overlap with the requirements for
photovoltaic materials. Lead-halide perovskites have there-
fore been considered for photocatalysis, owing to their high
absorption coefﬁcients, strong overlap in their absorption with
the solar spectrum, and long diffusion lengths, coupled with
the ability to achieve high-quality ﬁlms when processed at
low temperature. But lead-halide perovskites are limited by
their low chemical stability [406]. This necessitates tailoring
of the solution to minimize degradation to the perovskite (e.g.
using a saturated halo acid solution for water splitting), or
encapsulating the perovskite to isolate them from the polar
solvent [406, 411–414]. But ensuring the long-term stability
of the photocathode or photoanode, as well as avoiding
potential lead contamination of the solution motivate the
investigation of lead-free and more stable alternatives.
In photocatalytic applications, the wider band gap of
most perovskite-inspired materials is advantageous. Murphy
et al found that the optimal band gap for solar-driven water
splitting is 2.03 eV, which would enable a theoretical max-
imum solar-to-hydrogen conversion efﬁciency of 16.8%
[415]. This is because the quasi-Fermi levels of the semi-
conductor determine the oxidation/reduction potential of the
photoelectrochemical cell. Therefore, in the case of water
splitting, the band gap needs to at least be equal to the dif-
ference in redox potentials for H+/H2 (hydrogen reduction)
and O2/H2O (water oxidation). This has a value of 1.23 eV,
but the semiconductor band gap needs to be larger in order to
account for thermodynamic losses (0.3–0.4 eV) and over-
potentials for fast reactions (0.4–0.6 eV). A band gap of
>1.9 eV therefore should be used [409], indicating that many
of the double perovskites, A3B2X9 compounds and V–VI–VII
compounds are suitable, particularly given their improved
environmental stability compared to lead-halide perovskites
(refer to section 3). The electronic band positions of these
perovskite-inspired materials compared to the redox poten-
tials for water splitting, as well as for CO2 reduction [406] are
shown in ﬁgure 24. It is noted that the redox potentials and
band positions are given on a relative hydrogen electrode
(RHE) scale. H+/H2 under standard conditions is typically
taken as a reference point (standard hydrogen electrode),
which occurs at pH 0 and has a value of 4.44 ± 0.02 eV
relative to vacuum level according to IUPAC [409]. But
according to the Nernst equation, the redox potential for
H+/H2, as well as O2/H2O, CO2/CO and CO2/CH4 all vary
with −0.059 pH [V] [406]. The potential across the Helm-
holtz double layer on the semiconductor surface also changes
with −0.059 pH [V]. The RHE scale is therefore used, in
which all potentials are given relative to H+/H2 at a given
pH [409].
Many recent works on lead-free perovskite-inspired
materials for photocatalytic applications have focused on
double perovskites, vacancy-ordered perovskites and A3B2X9
materials. These materials have been demonstrated to be more
phase-stable than methylammonium lead iodide in ambient
air [145, 234, 237, 420]. Groups have also demonstrated
Cs2AgBiBr6 to remain the same phase after illumination with
70 mWcm−2 white light for 500 h [234], while Rb3Bi2I9,
Cs3Bi2I9 and (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 was found to maintain the
same phase after 12 h of illumination with a UV lamp
(80.4 μWcm−2 [416]). Despite these promising stability
results, efforts have focused on the application of these per-
ovskite-inspired materials as photocatalysts under benign
environments (e.g. halo acid solutions or gaseous precursors),
rather than in photoelectrolytic devices in more aggressive
aqueous environments. Nevertheless, these works have found
the photocatalysts to be stable under operation. Many works
have focused on CO2 reduction to form CO or CH4 (or a
mixture of both), and most materials have suitable electron
afﬁnities to induce the reduction of CO2 (ﬁgure 24). Zhou

Topical Reviewet al synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite nanocrystals
through hot-injection [234]. However, the yield of CO and
CH4 were 5.5 μmolg−1 and 0.65 μmolg−1 respectively. This
was improved by washing the nanocrystals in ethanol to
remove the oleic acid and oleylamine ligands prior to the
application of the nanocrystals as photocatalysts, which
resulted in the yields improving to 14.1 μmolg−1 and
9.6 μmolg−1 for CO and CH4 respectively. However, the
external quantum efﬁciency was only 0.028% at 398 nm
wavelength. Nevertheless, the washed double perovskite
nanocrystals were found to not change in phase or surface
composition or agglomerate after 6 h operation, implying that
the nanocrystals were stable in the ethyl acetate solution the
CO2 was dissolved in [234]. Wang et al obtained comparable
product yields using SnS2 nanosheets decorated with Cs2SnI6.
This was achieved by reacting the SnS2 nanosheets with CsI
dissolved in ethanol. The improvement in photocatalytic
activity by forming Cs2SnI6 was attributed to the smaller band
gap of the vacancy-ordered perovskite (1.3 eV [420]), which
led to an increased population of photogenerated carriers
[418]. Higher product yields were obtained by Bhosale et al
using A3B2I9 photocatalysts, especially Cs3Bi2I9, which was
found to have high photocatalytic activity and gave yields of
78 μmolg−1 and 15 μmolg−1 for CO and CH4 respectively
after 10 h [416]. The Cs3Bi2I9 was synthesized as nanocrys-
tals with oleic acid and oleylamine ligands and dispersed in
trichloromethane after puriﬁcation. The trichloromethane had
a mixture of CO2 gas and H2O vapor introduced to it, and the
nanocrystals were illuminated with a UV lamp [416]. Yet
higher product yield was achieved using Cs3Sb2Br9 nano-
crystals, which reached 516 [417] μmolg−1 for CO after 5 h,
with illumination under 1 sun radiation. By contrast, CsPbBr3
nanocrystals produced only 53.8 μmolg−1 CO after 5 h
under the same conditions. The Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals were
synthesized by hot-injection, and were exposed to CO2 gas
dissolved in octadecene. The same nanocrystals were used
three times, and it was found that with each subsequent usage,
there was a decrease in the product yield. But after the third
usage, the yield was approximately 30% of that of the ﬁrst
usage. Despite this reduction in activity, the yield remained
higher than the yield of fresh CsPbBr3 nanocrystals [417].
Cs2AgBiBr6 and (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 have also been inves-
tigated for the photocatalytic reduction of H+ to H2
[421, 422]. H2 is an important clean fuel that combusts to
only produce H2O, is used for hydrogen fuel cells, and is a
convenient option for storing excess solar energy to com-
pensate for the intermittent nature of terrestrial solar radiation
[405, 423]. Wang et al synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 powder, and
a mixture of HBr and H3PO2 was used as the H+ source.
The Cs2AgBiBr6 photocatalyst was illuminated with white
light (300 W), and H2 was generated with a rate of
0.6 μmolg−1h−1, averaged over 10 h. The photocatalytic
activity was improved by 80 times to 48.9 μmolg−1h−1 by
adding reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to the double per-
ovskite. Moreover, it was found that the photocatalytic
activity of the composite remained stable after 12 cycles
(120 h total). It is believed that the improved catalytic activity
was due to (1) photogenerated electrons from the double
perovskite being injected to the rGO, which contains active
sites for H+ reduction, and (2) a reduction in the recombi-
nation rate because of the separation of the photogenerated
electrons and holes at the perovskite/rGO junction [421].
A higher H2 production rate of 169.2μmolg−1h−1 was
reported by Guo et al who used (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 powder
coated with Pt. The electrolyte was HI solution, and it was
found that (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 remained phase-stable in this
solution. While the energy of the photogenerated holes was
insufﬁcient to oxidize water, they were believed to oxidize I−
to

Topical Reviewsmall decrease in the catalytic activity [422]. Finally,
Cs2AgBiBr6 powders have also been used as a photocatalyst
for the degradation of ionic dyes in ethanol solution by
forming oxygen radicals from O2. The catalytic activity was
again enhanced by coating with Pt. The double perovskite/Pt
composites were observed to maintain their photocatalytic
activity and phase after ﬁve cycles, which each had a duration
of 1 h [424].
V–VI–VII materials have been investigated as both
photocatalysts and photoelectrodes before the work on lead-
halide perovskite photocatalysts began. These V–VI–VII
materials are appealing due to their strong absorption of
visible light. Two examples are BiOI and BiSI, which have
band gaps of 1.6–1.9 eV [201, 425] (ﬁgure 25), and have been
investigated as photocatalysts for degrading organic con-
taminants in water, such as methyl orange and crystal violet
[425, 426]. BiOI itself has been found to have low photo-
catalytic activity due to its short charge-carrier lifetimes
[426]. The photocatalytic activity has been improved through
heterostructures, such as BiOI/MoS2, BiOI/WO3, BiOI/AgI,
BiOI/Ag,
BiOI/Ag/AgI,
BiOI/Bi2WO6,
BiOI/Ag3PO4,
BiOI/Bi2MoO6,
BiOI/ZnSn(OH)6,
BiOI/BiOBr
[426].
Similarly, the photocatalytic activity of BiSI was improved by
forming a composite with MoS2 [425]. MoS2 forms a type II
heterojunction with both BiOI and BiSI, and this is thought to
improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes,
which can then take part in the photodegradation of the
organic contaminants [426]. High photocatalytic activity was
achieved from SbSI without needing to form a hetero-
structure. Tamilselvan et al demonstrated that micron-sized
urchin-shaped SbSI degraded 97% of methyl orange [427],
which is comparable to BiOI/MoS2 nanocomposites and
higher than BiOI alone [426]. Investigations found that SbSI
induced the degradation of methyl orange by forming oxygen
radicals through the oxidation of singlet oxygen with photo-
generated holes [427]. Wang et al achieved a slightly higher
degradation rate of methyl orange in aqueous solution (99%
within 1 min when illuminated with a 300 W xenon lamp)
through the use of SbSI nanocrystals at room temperature or
at 65°C [428]. However, they attributed the degradation of
methyl orange to the formation of singlet oxygen rather than
oxygen
radicals
[428].
For
all
materials
(BiOI/MoS2,
BiSI/MoS2, SbSI), it was found that the photocatalysts
maintained their activity after several cycles [426].
Defects in bismuth oxyhalides have been found to
enhance photocatalytic activity. For example, it was found
that oxygen vacancies in BiOBr and BiOCl led to an increase
in the product yield for the reduction of CO2 to CO or CH4
[430, 431]. It is believed that these oxygen vacancies act as
sites for CO2 adsorption, where they are activated to radical
ions that can be reduced with photogenerated electrons. It is
also proposed that the oxygen vacancies can trap electrons to
prolong their separation from photogenerated holes [430].
These oxygen vacancies were induced in BiOBr by modify-
ing the solvothermal synthesis, in which ethylene glycol was
used as the solvent instead of water (which gave stoichio-
metric BiOBr [430]). For BiOCl, Zhang et al induced oxygen
vacancies by illuminating for 5 h with a Xe lamp. But despite
the improvements in photocatalytic activity, the product yield
of CH4 in BiOBr and BiOCl remained lower than Cs3Bi2I9
[416, 430, 431]. Nevertheless, the materials were found to
maintain their activity after several cycles, and, in the case of
BiOCl, it was found that the oxygen vacancies could be
regenerated through illumination [430, 431].
Bismuth oxyhalides have also been investigated in pho-
toelectrochemical cells. BiOI was used in photoelectrochemical
cells with an I3
−/I−redox couple (0.53 V reduction potential
relative to the standard hydrogen electrode) in an acetonitrile-
based solution. Platelets of BiOI were grown by successive
ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and spray pyr-
olysis [297, 432]. Such cells can be used as photovoltaic
devices, but the performance was low, with PCEs of 1% or
below, and EQEs reaching only 60% [297, 432]. Possibly a
limiting factor was a non-compact structure of the BiOI pla-
telets, or a non-optimal arrangement. Subsequent work on
growing BiOI by chemical vapor deposition resulted in more
compact ﬁlms, with PCEs reaching 1.8% and EQEs reaching
80% (refer to section 4.7) [201]. Beyond photovoltaics, bis-
muth oxyhalides could be used for photo-assisted water con-
version. Bhachu et al synthesized thin ﬁlms of BiOI, BiOBr

Topical Reviewand BiOCl by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AA-
CVD) and performed photoelectrochemical testing in a
0.5moll−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH of 6.5), with a Pt counter
electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode [296], and with 1
sun illumination. BiOI was found to not give any photocurrent
at 0 V(RHE), suggesting that it would not reduce H+. How-
ever, the photocurrent was ∼0.1mAcm−2 at 1.23 V(RHE),
suggesting that the BiOI photoelectrochemical cells could
oxidize water. BiOBr was also found to be capable of oxidizing
water, with a photocurrent of ∼0.3mAcm−2 at 1.23V(RHE).
BiOCl showed very little photocatalytic activity. But all three
materials were found to be unstable in the electrolyte. For
example, the photocurrent from BiOBr at 1 V versus Ag/AgCl
(1.6 V(RHE)) was found to decrease by 23% after 1 h, whereas
BiOI at the same potential decreased after only 100s [296].
Moreover, the photocurrents were signiﬁcantly lower than
those achieved with Cu2O, which has a similar band gap. But
recent Cu2O photoelectrodes have used a heterojunction
structure, as a well as a surface catalyst to improve the pho-
tocatalytic activity [423]. Similar strategies could be investi-
gated for V–VI–VII materials.
5.3. Radiation detection
The detection of ionizing radiation (particularly x-rays and
g-rays) is important for a wide range of applications,
including security screening, medical diagnostics and the
characterization of materials [147, 433–435]. Furthermore, it
is important to be able to detect and quantify heavy charged
particles, such as a-particles, which are by-products from
nuclear reactions [436]. The key properties of radiation
detector materials are that they need to have a large: (1)
average atomic number (Zavg), (2) product of mobility and
charge-carrier lifetime (mt), and (3) resistivity (>109 Ω cm
[433, 434, 437]). A high atomic number is needed because the
attenuation coefﬁcient (a) of high energy photons is propor-
tional to Z4/E3, where E is the photon energy [135, 291, 438].
A large mt product is needed for the efﬁcient extraction of
charge-carriers because the thickness required to completely
absorb radiation is often at the millimeter scale or larger
[438]. The dependence of the photocurrent (I) from a radia-
tion detector to the mt product is given by the Hecht equation
[434]:

In equation (6), I0 is the saturated photocurrent, V the
applied bias, L the thickness of the radiation detector, and s the
surface recombination velocity. Typically mt>10−4–10−3
cm2 V−1 is needed [439]. If the mt product is low, a large
applied ﬁeld is needed to extract the carriers, but this can
increase the dark current, which reduces the signal-to-noise
ratio. A high resistivity is also needed to maintain a low dark
current to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (which gives high
image contrast), as well as the ability to detect lower doses of
radiation (i.e. reduced lowest detectable dose rate). This is
especially important for medical diagnostic applications and
security screening, in which a lower dose of harmful radiation
can be used, reducing the risk of causing cancer in the human
subject. The lowest detectable dose rate required for medical
applications is 50 mGyairs−1 [435], but there is motivation to
be able to detect lower doses down to 0.1 nGyairs−1, which is
the background radiation levels in the US [135], and also
because using lower doses improves the spatial resolution of the
detector [135]. Note that the unit Gy (gray) represents the
energy of ionizing radiation absorbed by a particular mass
(1 Gy=1 Jkg−1). The dark current can be reduced by
increasing the band gap, and at room temperature, the band
gap should be between 1.4 and 2.5 eV [429, 435, 437]. The
upper limit to the band gap is so that the electron–hole ioniz-
ation energy is small [437]. Another important parameter in
radiation detectors is the sensitivity (S), which is deﬁned as
S=(ION – IOFF)/(dose rate [155]). The sensitivity would
therefore depend on Z, mt product, as well as the dark current.
The spatial resolution, response speed (which determines the
duration of exposure to harmful radiation that is needed),
energy resolution, linear dynamic range, uniformity and stabi-
lity of the detectors are also important parameters [135, 434].
Often the materials used for radiation detectors are single
crystals. This is because the penetration depth of radiation
(from soft x-rays to hard g-rays) are on the millimeter to
centimeter scale. It is also because single crystals tend to have
a lower defect density and larger mt products than thin ﬁlms.
A common radiation detector is silicon. But silicon has a low

Topical ReviewZ value and low band gap. Thus, despite its high mt product,
it has low stopping power, low resistivity, low sensitivity and
a high lowest detectable dose rate (table 3). Silicon therefore
tends to only be used for soft x-ray (E<10keV) detection
and in portable detectors (e.g. for EDX or XRF [434]).
Amorphous selenium (a-Se) has a higher Z value and there-
fore stronger stopping power for radiation. a-Se is the most
common solid-state material for the direct detection of x-rays,
but has a low mt product. High applied biases are therefore
needed, which leads to low sensitivities (table 3 [434]). Other
alternatives contain toxic elements (CdxZn1−xTe and HgI2
[434]), or require liquid nitrogen cooling (such as high purity
Ge [429], which has a small band gap of 0.66 eV and needs
cooling to reduce the dark current [434]). Beyond direct-
conversion materials, radiation detection can also occur by the
use of scintillators to absorb and down-convert the radiation
to lower-energy photons that can be detected using standard
silicon-based photodiodes [438]. But common scintillators are
alkali halides doped with toxic Tl [434, 438], and have given
lower resolution for imaging and lower linearity in their
response to the radiation dose [429] than direct detectors.
Recently, lead-halide perovskites have gained attention for
radiation detectors, owing to their composition of high atomic
number elements, the high mt products achievable, their
widely tunable band gaps, and their facile processability from
solution [433, 435, 436, 438]. As a result, perovskite X-ray
detectors can operate at room temperature with improved
performance (in terms of sensitivity and lowest detectable
dose rate) over a-Se and CdxZn1−xTe have been demonstrated
(table 3). Furthermore, lead-halide perovskites have demon-
strated promising radiation hardness to protons and g-rays
[434]. Lead-halide perovskites, with high PLQEs to visible
light excitation, have also demonstrated reasonable x-ray
excited luminescence yields at room temperature, making
them suitable for consideration as scintillators [440]. The
price of each perovskite single crystal is estimated to be
US$0.5–1.0cm−3 based on the price of the precursors [433].
By contrast CdxZn1−xTe single crystals cost $3000 cm−3, in
part due to the low demand for these materials for radiation
detectors [434]. Despite these advantages, lead-halide per-
ovskites have limited stability in air [145], and can degrade
under continuous irradiation with high ﬂux-density x-rays in
air [17] for extended periods of time. In addition, the lead
content of perovskite single crystals signiﬁcantly exceeds the
limited imposed by regulations on hazardous elements [135].
Ion migration in lead-halide perovskites could also result in
drift in the dark current, which could increase the lowest
detectable dose rate [147]. It is therefore important to consider
perovskite-inspired materials for radiation detection.
Perovskite-inspired materials have many desirable prop-
erties for radiation detectors: the band gaps of most materials
are within the ideal 1.4–2.5 eV range, and they are comprised
of high atomic number elements (e.g. Bi and I). In particular,
many of these materials are stable in air, have low toxicity
and can be processed as single crystals using facile fabrication
methods. Prior to the work on lead-halide perovskites, BiI3
had
already
been
investigated
for
radiation
detectors
[449–452]. BiI3 has a band gap of 1.67±0.09 eV [288], and
can be grown as single crystals by the vertical Bridgman
method and physical vapor transport [291, 450] (refer to
section 3.7 for details). Owing to the high Zavg of 60.5 and
density (5.78 gcm−3), the mass absorption coefﬁcient is large
(6.746 cm2g−1 at 60 keV). In addition, BiI3 has a low
ionization energy (5.8 eV) that is comparable to CdxZn1−xTe
(5 eV) and lower than a-Se (45 eV). BiI3 can therefore easily
convert absorbed x-rays into charges through the photo-
electric effect [450]. For device characterization, BiI3 is used
in a photoconductor structure owing to its high resistivity
(109–1011Ωcm), in which its dark current is several orders
of magnitude smaller than its photocurrent. That is, BiI3 has
two ohmic contacts, usually Au or Pd [449, 450]. These can
be applied on the front and back surface of the single crystal
(planar) or both on the front surface (coplanar). Sun et al
found that the planar structure resulted in 1.8-2.5 times higher
sensitivities of ∼1.3×104 mCGy−1
air cm−2, which are com-
parable to MAPbBr3 and larger than CdxZn1−xTe or a-Se
[450] (table 3). This was attributed to a more uniform electric
ﬁeld in the planar conﬁguration [450]. Dmitriev et al used the
planar conﬁguration to measure an electron mobility-lifetime
product of 10−5 cm2V−1 [449] through photoconductivity
measurements.
By contrast, Cs2AgBiBr6, MA3Bi2I9 and (NH4)3Bi2I9 sin-
gle crystals are grown from solution [135, 147, 155]. Au
electrodes were used for Cs2AgBiBr6 and MA3Bi2I9 radiation
detectors [135, 147], whereas Ag was painted the (NH4)3Bi2I9
single crystal [155]. The ionization energies for these materials
are low: 5.61 eV for Cs2AgBiBr6 [135] and 5.47 eV for
(NH4)3Bi2I9 [155]. As-grown Cs2AgBiBr6 was reported to have
a trap density of 4.54×109cm−3 and mobility of 3.17cm2
V−1 s−1, as determined from space-charge limited current
measurements. By post-annealing the single crystals at 100°C
for 2h in N2, the trap density was reduced to 1.74×109cm−3,
whereas the mobility increased to 11.81cm2 V−1 s−1. This
resulted in the mt product increasing from 3.75×10−3 to
6.3×10−3cm2V−1, which is larger than a-Se and BiI3
(table 3). The surface recombination velocity was reduced by
washing the single crystals in isopropanol to remove surface
defect states, resulting in the resistivity increasing to 1011Ωcm.
Despite these promising properties, and despite Cs2AgBiBr6
having a higher Zavg than MAPbBr3, the sensitivity achieved
was
only
8mCGy−1
air cm−2,
which
increased
to
105m
CGy−1
air cm−2 after applying an electric ﬁeld of 25Vmm−1.
However, the larger resistivity led to a low dark current
(∼0.15nA cm−2 at 5 V) and therefore a small lowest detectable
dose rate of 0.0597μCGyairs−1 [135]. A smaller lowest
detectable dose rate and signiﬁcantly larger sensitivity were
achieved with MA3Bi2I9 single crystals, which have a 0 D
crystal structure (table 3 [147]). This may be due to the wide
band gap and high resistivity (1011Ωcm in the out-of-plane
direction) resulting in a low dark current of only 0.98nAcm−2
at 120 V bias [147]. Notably the activation energy barrier for
ion migration was found to be 0.31–0.46 eV [147], comparable
43

Topical Reviewto Cs2AgBiBr6 (0.35 eV) and larger than MAPbBr3 (0.19 eV
[155]). A higher activation energy barrier was found for
(NH4)3Bi2I9. (NH4)3Bi2I9 is a layered material, and the activa-
tion energy barrier was found to be higher in the [001] direction
(i.e. between planes; 0.91 eV see 0.72 eV along the [99]
direction [155]). Owing to the layered structure, (NH4)3Bi2I9
exhibited anisotropic transport properties, in which higher mt
products and sensitivities were obtained in the [99] direction
(1.1×10−2cm2V−1; 0.8×104 mCGy−1
air cm−2) than the
[001] direction (4.0×10−3cm2V−1; 803 μCGy−1
air cm−2).
However, the signal to noise ratio in the [001] direction was
found to be larger, leading to a smaller lowest detectable dose
rate of 0.055 mGyairs−1 (see 0.210 mGyairs−1 in the [99]
direction), which was attributed to reduced ion migration [155].
All three materials were found to be stable in ambient air and
withstand temperatures >200 °C [135, 147, 155].
Beyond the direct conversion of x-rays to electrical
energy, perovskites have also been investigated as scintilla-
tors. A recent work found CsPbBr3 nanocrystals to demon-
strate signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity than Bi4Ge3O12 (one of
the standard scintillator materials), and have a sensitivity to
x-rays on the same order of magnitude as CsI:Tl [453].
Recently, (C8H17NH3)2SnBr4 was demonstrated as a lead-free
perovskite scintillator. These had a PLQE of 98%. It was
suggested that the mechanism for x-ray induced emission
(radioluminescence) was photoelectric ionization, followed
by relaxation to the band-edge to form excitons that recom-
bine radiatively. The radioluminescence spectrum was found
to be almost the same as the PL spectrum. The emission peak
was centered at 596 nm, which is detectable by standard
CCDs. The tin-based perovskite was made into a composite
with PMMA. The radioluminescence was found to be linear
with the x-ray dose down to 104 mGys−1, which is a sufﬁ-
ciently low dose to be safely used in x-ray imaging. The
spatial resolution achieved with the perovskite scintillator/
CCD system was 200mm, which was lower than reported for
lead-based perovskite systems. The tin-based perovskite/
PMMA composite also demonstrated no decrease in radi-
oluminescence intensity after cycled x-ray exposure over
800 s [454].
In g-ray detection, the energy resolution of the detector is
an important parameter. This is because the detector needs to
accurately identify the characteristic spectrum of speciﬁc
radionucleotides. Although high energy resolution can be
achieved with high purity Ge and CdxZn1−xTe (table 4), these
materials are limited by their need to operate at cryogenic
temperatures or high cost, respectively, as discussed above.
Recently, He et al achieved high sensitivity g-ray detectors
using CsPbBr3 single crystals, which demonstrated an energy
resolution of 3.8%–3.9% (FWHM relative to the energy of the
peak) for the g-ray peak [455]. In perovskite-inspired mate-
rials, there has been extensive work on BiI3 for g-ray detec-
tion. The total attenuation length for photoelectric absorption
(the main process by which g-rays are converted to electron–
hole pairs) in BiI3 is smaller than CdxZn1−xTe (ﬁgure 25(b))
due to the higher Zavg for BiI3 [429] (table 4). But despite the
high Zavg and reasonable mt products demonstrated in x-ray
detectors, BiI3 capable of detecting moderate energy g-rays
(>100 keV) have only been recently demonstrated. The
limited performance has been attributed to the formation of
voids and defects in BiI3 during growth by the vertical
Bridgeman method [439]. The density of iodine vacancies
was found to be reduced through Sb doping, which led to
improved resistivities (from 1.45×108Ωcm for BiI3 to
2.63×109Ωcm for Sb:BiI3) and a four-order-of-magnitude
reduction in the leakage current in BiI3 single crystals [291].
The higher-quality Sb:BiI3 crystals demonstrated an energy
resolution of 2.2% for 137Cs (662 keV) radiation [439], sub-
stantially lower than reported for CsPbBr3 [455].
Beyond x-rays and g-rays, the detection of a-particles is
important because these are the byproducts of nuclear reac-
tions and nuclear decays [436]. mt particles are also used in
Table 4. Properties of direct g-ray and a-particle detectors.

Topical Reviewthe measurement of composition, such as in Rutherford
backscattering spectrometry. The energy resolution of the
a-particle detector is therefore an important factor. In testing
a-particle detectors, 5.5 MeV a-particles from an 241Am
source are commonly used [291, 429, 436, 452, 461]. Current
work on perovskite and perovskite-inspired materials for
a-particle detectors have not demonstrated energy resolutions
or mt
products matching industry-standard CdxZn1−xTe
(table 4). In fact, the defect perovskites (A3B2I9 materials) are
not able to resolve the a-particle peak, and have low mt
products. This was attributed to the low mobilities, which
limit the charge collection efﬁciency [429]. By contrast,
Sb:BiI3 single crystals were found to have electron mobilities
of 1000±200cm2 V−1 s−1, which are similar to the
mobilities of CdxZn1−xTe [291]. Sb:BiI3 demonstrated an
energy resolution of 66% to a-particles, which improved to
33% after applying an electric ﬁeld of 532Vcm−1 for 8 h,
and the improvement in resolution was attributed to reduced
leakage currents [291]. CsPbBr3 single crystals were also
found to be capable of resolving the a-particle peak,
demonstrating an energy resolution of 15%. An important
factor was the high mobilities of 63 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons
and 49cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes, leading to reasonable mt
products reaching up to 10−3 cm2V−1 [436]. Future efforts to
improve the performance of defect perovskites for a-particle
detection should focus on improving the mobility [429].
While the mobilities could be limited due to strong-electron
phonon coupling, defect perovskite x-ray detectors have
achieved mt products reaching 10−2cm2 V−1 s−1 (table 3),
and improved performance may be expected from these
materials for a-particle detection.
5.3.1. Electronic devices.
Two critical electronic devices are
thin ﬁlm transistors (TFTs) and memristors. The operating
principles of these devices can be found in review articles,
such as [28, 438]. TFTs are ubiquitously used in electronic
circuits, in which they are used as switches, for ampliﬁcation,
as well as for the fabrication of logic devices (particularly the
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor or CMOS).
Memristors are actively explored for next-generation terabyte-
scale non-volatile memory storage that can be operated with
low power. Historically, the materials considered for these
applications have been silicon or oxides [28, 438]. But more
recently, lead-halide perovskites have been actively explored
for these applications with promising results [28, 438]. As
with all other electronic applications, it will be important to
reduce the lead content used in these devices, as well as
improve the stability under operation.
In
TFTs,
tin-based
perovskites
have
been
widely
explored as a lead-free alternative. In fact, the ﬁrst organic-
inorganic perovskite TFT was a 2D tin-based perovskite
((C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 or (PEA)2SnI4), reported by Mitzi
et al well before lead-halide perovskites were actively
considered for photovoltaics. This TFT demonstrated p-channel
character with a ﬁeld-effect mobility of 0.6cm2 V−1 s−1 [462].
Signiﬁcantly higher electron mobilities have recently been
reported in lead-based perovskites, with ﬁeld-effect mobilities
exceeding 10cm2 V−1 s−1 demonstrated at room temperature
[463], which is comparable to the electron ﬁeld-effect mobility
of strontium titanate perovskites [28]. We note that an electron
mobility of 396 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been reported from MAPbI3
TFTs at room temperature [464], but there is uncertainty on
whether this was overestimated. Recently, tin-based perovskite
TFTs have been demonstrated with hole ﬁeld-effect mobilities
exceeding those of lead-based perovskites [463]. This was
achieved by Matshushima et al using the same material
previously reported by Mitzi et al Critical improvements were:
(1) the passivation of the surface of PEA2SnI4 with self-
assembled monolayers of NH3I-SAM, and (2) the development
of the top-gate, top-source/drain device structure (ﬁgure 26(a))
to ensure both surfaces are passivated. These led to minimal
hysteresis in the transfer curves (ﬁgure 26(b)), with the hole
ﬁeld-effect mobilities reaching 15cm2 V−1 s−1 [465] and on/
off ratios reaching 106. p-type TFTs are especially important
because CMOS requires both n- and p-type TFTs, and fewer
options
for
high-performing
p-type
TFTs

currently

Topical Reviewavailable. The hole mobility of MASnI3 single crystals has
been found to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the
ﬁeld-effect mobilities achieved thus far (refer to section 3), and
it is expected that the in-plane mobility of 2D (PEA)2SnI4 is
comparably high [465]. Thus, future improvements in the hole
ﬁeld-effect mobility could be expected. However, (PEA)2SnI4
has low stability, and TFTs have been found to degrade
quickly, even when they are in high vacuum or inside a
glovebox [466]. Improved stability was achieved by replacing
PEA

(4 Tm=2-(3″′,4′-dimethyl-[2,2′:5′,2″:5″,2″′-quaterthiophen]-
5-yl)ethan-1-ammonium). (4 Tm)2SnI4 perovskite TFTs were
found to retain their performance after storage in air for a
month. TFTs were made using a bottom gate, top-source/drain
structure, which gave a hole ﬁeld-effect mobility of 2.32cm2
V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 105–106. While the ﬁeld-effect
mobility is lower than that reported by Matshushima et al a
different structure was used; (PEA)2SnI4 TFTs made in the
same structure as the (4Tm)2SnI4 TFTs had a ﬁeld-effect
mobility of 0.15cm2 V−1 s−1, with an on/off ratio of
104–105 [466].
Memristors are devices with variable resistance states,
which depend on the applied voltage and current history
[467].
Such
devices
were
ﬁrst
proposed
as
a
fourth
fundamental circuit element in 1971 (along with resistors,
inductors and capacitors) [468], and realized in 2008 [469].
These variable resistance states can be used for high-density
memory storage, logical computations, as well as for
neuromorphic computing [467]. Such devices switch between
resistance states through the application of an electric ﬁeld.
As such, memristors have low power consumption and retain
their resistance states after the electric ﬁeld has been removed,
which contrasts to common commercial non-volatile memory
(e.g.
NAND
ﬂash
[470]).
The
key
requirements
for
memristors are (1) rapid switching between the high and
low resistance states, (2) low operating voltage (for set/reset
and read), (3) large ratio in resistance of the on and off states
(on/off ratio), (4) large endurance (number of switching
cycles in which the resistance states are maintained), and (5)
long retention time [438] of the resistance states after power
has been removed. Thin ﬁlm memristors are typically
comprised of an insulator sandwiched between two degen-
erate contacts (e.g. metal–insulator–metal structure). Wide
band gap oxides are commonly used for the insulator layer,
such as TaOx, HfO2 and SrRuO3, which have achieved on/off
ratios ranging from 10 to 103, endurances ranging from
103–1010 cycles, and retention times between 104 s and 10 y
[438]. Lead-halide perovskites (MAPbI3, CsPbBr3 and 2D
perovskites, among others) have recently been demonstrated
to exhibit resistive switching, with high on/off ratios reaching
107 and rapid switching between resistance states (640μs)
but lower endurances of up to 3000 cycles. Retention times
up to 105 s have been measured, but the set/reset voltages are
lower than their oxide counterparts (which commonly have
set/reset voltages with absolute values exceeding 1 V) [438].
But as with many other optoelectronic device applications,
the need eliminate toxic lead from memristors has motivated
the exploration of perovskite-inspired materials for resistive
switching [467, 470–472].
The
wide
band
gaps
of
many
perovskite-inspired
materials leads to a low dark resistance, which is advanta-
geous for achieving a high resistance in the off state. The
ability to process these materials using low temperature, facile
methods is also advantageous and makes the materials
compatible with ﬂexible substrates [470]. At the same time,
these materials have low formation energies for vacancies
(especially halides), which can act as conductive ﬁlaments in
resistive switching [471]. This ionic vacancy conduction
mechanism (known as valence change memory) has been
identiﬁed in MASnBr3, CsSnI3 and Cs3Sb2Br9 memristors
[467, 470, 471] using inert Au electrodes. For MASnBr3 and
Cs3Sb2Br9, the conducting ﬁlaments are attributed to bromide
vacancies [467, 471]. When a bias exceeding the set voltage
is applied, Br−accumulate at the anode, while bromide
vacancies form and accumulate at the cathode [467, 471]. The
Br−may be oxidized to Br atoms that are stored in the inert
electrode [467]. The bromide vacancies have a low activation
energy
barrier
to
migration
(0.22–0.57eV),
and
these
vacancies can form a conductive channel bridging the two
electrodes, resulting in the memristor switching from the high
to low resistance state. Composition and Raman measure-
ments have shown that the segregation of Br occurs. Applying
a negative reset voltage causes the Br atoms to diffuse away
from the electrode they were stored at and recombine with the
halide vacancies, causing the conductive ﬁlaments to rupture
and the memristor return to the high resistance state
[467, 471]. The conductive ﬁlaments for CsSnI3 has been
attributed to tin vacancies, which form and are removed in a
similar manner to bromide vacancies [470]. Valence change
memory has also been suggested as the mechanism for
resistive switching in BiOI memristors, which are believed to
form conductive ﬁlaments through oxygen vacancies [473].
An alternative to valence change memory for the
formation of conductive ﬁlaments is through electrochemical
metallization (ECM), in which a reactive metal anode (often
Ag) is oxidized when an electric ﬁeld is applied. The metal
cations are the conductive ﬁlament and migrate through the
solid ﬁlm electrolyte to the cathode, where they are reduced
and electrocrystallize to form the metal again. To reset the
device from the low to high resistance state, a negative bias is
applied, which results in the dissolution of the conducting
ﬁlaments through Joule-heating assisted dissolution [470].
This ECM mechanism was found to occur in CsSnI3 and
Cs3Cu2I5 memristors with Ag top electrodes. In both devices,
a layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was spin coated
over the perovskite-inspired materials to improve its stability
in ambient air, as well as preventing the reaction between Ag
and the iodide-based thin ﬁlm, which is important for
improving the endurance of the devices [470, 472]. The
PMMA layer did not act as a barrier to silver dissolution and
migration, allowing resistive switching to occur. Han et al
compared CsSnI3 memristors using Ag versus Au electrodes
to compare the ECM and VCM mechanisms. They found the
memristors operating based on ECM to give improved on/off
ratios (>1000) and low set/reset voltages of 0.13 and −0.08

memristors gave improved retention (104 s [470]).
To summarize the devices discussed in section 5, a
comparison of the state-of-the-art performance of perovskite-
inspired materials across all applications is given in table 5.
6. Conclusions and outlook
Lead-halide perovskites have developed at an unprecedented
rate in photovoltaics due to an ideal set of optoelectronic
properties. Among these properties is its tolerance to point
defects, which allows perovskite devices to achieve high
efﬁciencies despite being processed at low temperature using
simple fabrication methods that give rise to high densities of
point defects. This contrasts to traditional semiconductors,
such as silicon and III–V compounds, and has spurred efforts
to identify ‘perovskite-inspired materials’ that could replicate
the exceptional optoelectronic properties of LHPs, but which
are free from the toxicity burden of lead and which are also
more thermally and environmentally stable. The effort to
develop PIMs is a multi-disciplinary challenge involving
theorists, experimentalists and device engineers.
For theorists, the primary challenges have been: (1)
unveiling the origins of the tolerance of LHPs to point
defects, and (2) developing improved approaches to design
PIMs [474]. As discussed in section 2.2, defect tolerance is a
phenomenon that rarely originates from any single material
property. Indeed, there are several factors which can con-
tribute to the defect tolerance of a material, each with different
levels of efﬁcacy and rarity. To achieve the remarkable defect
tolerance of LHPs, successful PIMs will likely be required to
replicate the wealth of ‘defect-tolerant’ material properties
exhibited by LHPs (atypical band structure, strong dielectric
screening, anharmonic carrier capture etc). Through deeper
understanding of defect-tolerant properties and their inter-
relationships, as well as extending the materials discovery
abstraction pyramid (ﬁgure 2) to the explicit treatment of
crystal defects, the accuracy of predictions for next-genera-
tion, high-performance PIMs will be improved immensely.
For materials design, recent years have witnessed an
explosion in the popularity of data mining (materials informatics)
and ML procedures, which promise to revolutionize the materials
discovery process [30, 37, 474]. An inspiring, prototypical
example is the use of text mining and natural language proces-
sing to extract previously-hidden insights from the vast dataset of
materials science literature. In 2019, Ceder et alexempliﬁed this
concept by retrieving nearly 20 000 ‘codiﬁed synthesis recipes’
from over 50 000 paragraphs in the recent solid-state literature
[475]. In addition to pure data mining, the integration of

Topical Reviewphysics-based ML models into the high-throughput screening
process could signiﬁcantly augment the power and efﬁciency of
materials discovery. For instance, by implementing accurate ML
models of material stability and chemical descriptors as a pre-
screening step, before the application of expensive electronic
structure theory (i.e.DFT), the computational load could be
considerably reduced, thereby accelerating the process and
affording the use of expanded input compositional space [474].
Moreover, ML techniques may be leveraged to uncover subtle
chemical trends in successful candidate materials (e.g. defect-
tolerant material properties), which may not be initially apparent
to the ‘human eye’ [37]. Indeed, the ability to physically interpret
trained ML models and distinguish causation from correlation is
an ongoing area of research [476].
For materials scientists, chemists, physicists and engineers,
one of the main challenges has been to develop suitable fabri-
cation methods for each class of materials. A wide range of
methods have been investigated, from solution processing to
chemical and physical vapor deposition (which can be used at
scale), through to ‘hybrid’ methods that combine both solution-
and vapor-based processing. A series of dedicated efforts has led
to pinhole-free thin ﬁlms being achieved across a wide range of
materials, with methods to control the grain size and preferred
orientation demonstrated, which all have led to improvements in
the performance of the materials in devices. Furthermore, it has
been widely shown across many families of PIMs that the
materials are more stable thermally and in air compared to LHPs
(e.g. Cs2AgBiBr6 and BiOI). There are a handful of exceptions,
namely tin- and germanium-based perovskites, as well as InI
(owing to In being unstable in the +1 oxidation state). But the
incorporation of additives and developing 2D structures have
been utilized to enhance their ambient stability. Critically, defect
tolerance has been demonstrated computationally across several
materials, such as BiOI, CuSbS2 and CuSbSe2.
One of the challenges across many PIMs is their wide band
gaps, which are not suitable for single-junction photovoltaic
devices. Although these materials may be used as top-cells in
tandems, recent work has shown these materials to also hold
signiﬁcant promise in applications beyond PV. For example, in
light-emission applications, photocatalysis and radiation detec-
tors, wide band gaps of 2 eV or larger are advantageous, which
compounded with the stability of these materials, makes them
of practical interest for these applications. For example, inor-
ganic double perovskites have been demonstrated as efﬁcient,
stable white-light emitters, which will be important for solid-
state lighting. Many PIMs have suitable band positions to
reduce H+ or CO2, and Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals were demon-
strated to more efﬁciently reduce CO2 than CsPbBr3. In radia-
tion detectors, the wide band gap of PIMs results in low dark
current, which is important for them to achieve a high signal-to-
noise ratio, with a low lowest detectable dose rate, down to
0.6 nGyairs−1 in MA3Bi2I9. This is smaller than the lowest dose
detectable by MAPbBr3 as well as standard x-ray detectors,
such as a-Se and CZT, and will allow lower and safer doses of
x-rays to be used in security equipment or in medical screening.
Furthermore, the composition of PIMs of high atomic number
elements allows these materials to have high stopping power for
radiation, which in turn results in sensitivities to X-rays being
comparable to MAPbBr3 and orders of magnitude larger than
conventional Si, a-Se and CZT materials. The high resistivities
of PIMs owing to their wide band gap is also advantageous for
achieving a high resistance ‘off’ state in memristors, and on/off
ratios comparable to or larger than conventional oxide-based
materials have been reported. The exploration of PIMs in these
electronic applications is still in the nascent stages, but there are
already very promising signs of the potential of these low-
toxicity materials to give stable, efﬁcient performance.
However, an important challenge faced by the ﬁeld is the
limited mobility of some PIMs. Many PIMs either have a 0D
crystal structure (e.g. Cs3Bi2I9), or a 0D electronic structure
(e.g. Cs2AgBiBr6), which limits mobilities and drift/diffusion
lengths. Furthermore, these lower-dimensional materials have
higher exciton binding energies, as well as soft lattices and
strong
electron–phonon coupling.
These
factors
further
restrict mobilities due to the formation of excitons (which
need to be split to free carriers), as well as polarons or self-
trapped excitons. This limits the current densities and efﬁ-
ciencies in PVs, as well as the μτ product of PIM single
crystals, which are lower than in standard radiation detector
materials. The main exception to the low mobilities in PIMs
are tin-based perovskites, which have disperse bands. Indeed,
this has resulted in these materials achieving ﬁeld-effect
mobilities comparable to LHPs in p-type TFTs.
Many PIMs also have crystal structures based on low
dimensional networks (e.g. 1D and 2D connectivity), which
leads to certain crystallographic orientations having higher
mobility. This anisotropy in carrier transport necessitates careful
control over the preferred orientation of the materials in thin
ﬁlms, such that: (1) the high mobility directions connect both
electrodes in devices, while (2) also maintaining a compact
morphology that does not lead to shunting. For example, BiOI
has a layered structure, and a {012} preferred orientation is
desirable to connect the top and bottom electrodes in vertically-
structured PV devices. But this open structure leads to low
shunt resistances, which limits open-circuit voltages. New
device structures or strategies that allow high mobility and high
shunt resistance to be simultaneously achieved are needed.
Beyond these materials and fabrication challenges, further
efforts are needed to identify the cause of defect tolerance. While
some ns2 compounds have been found to be defect tolerant,
others have been found to have deep traps, e.g. BiI3 and SbI3. A
deeper understanding of defect tolerance will be necessary to
develop increasingly reﬁned, accurate, and comprehensive
design principles, and thus more efﬁcient, targeted screening
procedures. On the computational front, recent advances in
theory and technology have enabled both the qualitative and
quantitative descriptions of bulk and defect-related material
properties from ab-initio modelling. Overcoming the challenges
associated with complex defect calculations (section 2.3.5) will
facilitate accurate prediction and validation of promising can-
didate materials, alongside enhanced understanding of exper-
imental results and defect behavior.
Ultimately, for future research efforts in materials dis-
covery to be successful, consensus and consistency with
selection metrics will be immensely beneﬁcial, allowing
greater transferability and comparability between studies. For

Topical Reviewsimilar reasons, alongside the reduction of duplicate work, the
facilitation of sharing both data and methodologies should be
vehemently encouraged. Frameworks which automate this
process (e.g. AiiDA [98] for materials modelling), maintain-
ing data provenance and reproducibility, will be especially
advantageous in this regard. This effort should not be limited
to only computational data, but also experimental data (e.g.
optical and transport measurements) and synthesis details.
This will help to reﬁne computational models, as well as
providing ‘training’ datasets for more general ML models.
Overall, the future of PIMs research will require an inter-
linked, synergistic approach between theory and experiment
in order to identify further promising materials.
