The ionization potential distributions of hydrated hydroxide and hydronium are computed with the
many-body approach for electron excitations with conﬁgurations generated by ab initio molecular
dynamics. The experimental features are well reproduced and found to be closely related to the molecular
excitations. In the stable conﬁgurations, the ionization potential is mainly perturbed by solvent water
molecules within the ﬁrst solvation shell. On the other hand, electron excitation is delocalized on both
proton receiving and donating complex during proton transfer, which shifts the excitation energies and
broadens the spectra for both hydrated ions.

The nature of the solvation structures of hydroxide
(OH) and hydronium (H3Oþ) aqueous solutions is of
fundamental interest. It is the prerequisite to understanding
the mechanism of proton transfer (PT) through the
autoprolysis process in water, which is behind diverse
phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology [1–7].
Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) has recently emerged
as an important experimental technique in elucidating the
interactions between hydrated ions and surrounding water
molecules [6,8–10]. The state-of-the-art PES measurement
is now able to measure the energy required to remove an
electron from the solvated ions with respect to the Fermi
level, which has been successfully used to determine the
ionization potentials (IPs) of hydrated OH and H3Oþ [6].
To have an insightful understanding of the experiments,
there is a critical need for theoretical modeling, at the
atomic scale, which can unambiguously connect the IP
and its distributions to its solvation structures.
Given that the disordered structures of the liquids can
be simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
[11,12], the PES spectra can be computed by the electron
excitation theory such as Hedin’s GW self-energy approxi-
mation [13,14]. However, such a theoretical approach has
not yet been applied to the study of the PES spectra in ion
solutions. The difﬁculty lies in the fact that the quasipar-
ticle method scales unfavorably with the system size [14].
On the other hand, a proper simulation of disordered liquid
structure requires a large supercell modeling. The compu-
tational burden is even more severe when it is necessary to
take into account the statistical ﬂuctuations of solvation
structures both from the underlying H-bond network and,
more drastically, from the structural diffusion of PT. As a
compromise, the computationally efﬁcient static density
functional theory (DFT) [15] or the semiclassical approxi-
mation was used [6]. However, the static DFT designed for
ground state electron minimization strongly underesti-
mates the IP as an electron excitation property [6,14,15].
Because of the same difﬁculty, the precise assignment of
IPs for these hydrated ions has yet not been accurately
determined.
To address the above issues, in the current work, we
generate the liquid structures of solvated hydroxide and
hydronium in water by AIMD simulations and then com-
pute the PES spectra within many-body formalism for
electron excitation. In particular, we adopt a recently
implemented methodology treating the inhomogeneous
electronic screening of the medium [16–19], in which the
maximally localized Wannier functions [20] are used to
greatly increase the computational efﬁciency. The IPs of
hydrated hydronium and hydroxide are determined by the
real-space projection of the quasiparticle density of states
on these solvated ion complexes. The resulting IPs and their
distribution are in quantitative agreement with experiments
in both position and broadening. The IPs of hydrated ions in
liquid solutions are associated with the molecular excita-
tion, however, strongly inﬂuenced by thewater molecules in
the ﬁrst solvation shell. During the PT, the structural diffu-
sion results in a delocalized defect eigenstate. As a result,
the IPs of hydrated ions are broadened and shift into the
main feature of bulk water. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst time that GW based quasiparticle theory has
been applied to the PES spectra of ion solutions.
Ion solutions are generated by two equilibrated AIMD
trajectories containing either one hydroxide or hydronium
with 63 surrounding water molecules [21]. An elevated
temperature of T ¼ 330 K is used, which has been found
to approximately capture the structural softening of a H
bond in liquid water due to the quantum nuclear effect [24].
Electron excitation calculations are completed using the
static Coulomb hole and screened exchange approach
combined with electron screening effects from the inho-
mogeneous medium within the Hybertsen-Louie ansatz
[16–19], in which the experimental dielectric constant of
liquid water 0 ¼ 1:8 [25] is used as an input parameter.
In Fig. 1, we present our theoretical PES spectra of both
ion solutions based on a quasiparticle density of states.

 2013 American Physical SocietyIt can be seen that the overall PES spectra of both hydro-
nium and hydroxide solutions are dominated by three
features belonging to bulk water, which have 1b2, 3a1,
and 1b1 characteristics with decreasing excitation energy
as shown in Figs. 2(a)–2(c), respectively. The IP is asso-
ciated with the valence electron excitation of a solvated ion
in water. Although embedded in the water solution PES
spectra, it still can be identiﬁed by the real-space projection
of the quasiparticle density of states onto the hydrated ions
in the energy range [26]. The resulting IP distributions of
hydrated hydroxide and hydronium are also shown in the
shaded areas of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. It can be
seen that the main feature of the IP of hydrated OH is
represented by a narrow distribution, whose peak is cen-
tered at 9.99 eVand close to the low energy edge of the 1b1
feature of bulk water. The spectrum signal is much less
obvious in the 3a1 region and almost absent in the 1b2
region of bulk water. As far as the IP of hydrated H3Oþ is
concerned, the most prominent feature is a broad peak
centered at 19.01 eV close to the high energy edge of the
1b2 feature of bulk water. Much less signal is found in the
3a1 region, and almost no signal is found in the 1b1 region
of bulk water. Strikingly, current theory accurately repro-
duces the experimental measurement [6], in which the IPs
of hydrated hydroxide and hydronium are found to be
centered at 9:2 and 20 eV, respectively. In both experi-
ment [6] and current theory, the spectrum distribution of
solvated hydronium is found to be much broader than that
of solvated hydroxide. In stark contrast, the previous
studies based on DFT calculations revealed that the IPs
of solvated OH and H3Oþ were located at 12 and
5 eV, respectively, which underestimated the experimen-
tal value over 50% [15]. This is because DFT, as a ground
state theory, strongly underestimates the optical band gap
properties. For a direct comparison with PES experiments,
the electron excitation process can be more appropriately
described by the GW self-energy approximation [27].
The accurate quasiparticle predictions now enable a
more precise assignment of the IPs of hydrated ions. In

087801-2functions (QWs) for the main features, which are located
close to the 1b1 region of bulk water for hydrated OH and
close to the 1b2 region of bulk water for hydrated H3Oþ.
The typical QWs of less prominent features are also shown
in Fig. 2, whose energies are in the 3a1 region of bulk water
for both ion solutions. For comparison, the three lowest IP
energy states of the OH and H3Oþ monomers are also
presented. The similarity of the electron excitation in ion
solutions and that in gas phases indicates that the IPs
should be attributed to molecular ionization, however,
strongly perturbed by the solvation structures of the sur-
rounding water molecules.
Clearly, the main feature of the IP in hydrated hydroxide
at 9.99 eV should be assigned to the ﬁrst valence electron
excitation of the OH monomer. This is due to the resem-
blance of the electron excitations between the gas phase and
the liquid solution. In the aqueous solution, the typical
QWof the main feature is a well-localized hydroxide defect
state of clear lone pair character, as shown in Figs. 2(g) and
2(i). It originates from two degenerate 1 bonds of the OH
monomer. The degeneracy is broken by the disordered
liquid structure and results in an excitation distribution
instead of one single ionization energy. It can be expected
that the spectrum distribution is largely dependent on the
solvation structure and will be different with or without PT.
In the absence of PT, the current AIMD simulation ﬁnds
that solvated hydroxide adopts the most stable conﬁgura-
tion in such a way that OH accepts four H bonds with the
possibility of donating one [1]. The four water molecules
donating the H bond are approximately in one plane.
Consistently, this lone pair QW is mainly localized on the
OH itself, however, with a signiﬁcant weight on the water
molecules within the ﬁrst solvation shell. Thus, without PT,
the IP is mainly affected by the ﬂuctuating ﬁrst-shell sol-
vation structure embedded in the H-bond network of liquid
water. During PT, the OH exchanges one proton with a
neighboring water molecule. Our current simulation indi-
cates that the PT mechanism is consistent with the dynami-
cal hypercoordination scenario proposed by Tuckerman
et al. [1]. The structural diffusion is initiated by breaking
one of the four accepting H bonds and followed by a proton
exchange along the shortest H bond. Intriguingly, the struc-
tural diffusion is accompanied by a nontrivial change in the
electronic state. The lone pair QW is now localized on both
proton donating and proton receiving molecules, as shown
in Fig. 2(i), instead of its main localization on OH only
before the PTin Fig. 2(g). The delocalized QW facilitates its
hybridization with surrounding water molecules. As a
result, the IP exhibits a blueshift towards the main feature
of the bulk water spectra accompanied by a broadened
distribution as illustrated in Fig. 3(a).
In a similar scenario, we assign the main feature of the
IP distribution of hydrated hydronium to the second va-
lence excitation of two degenerate p orbitals of the H3Oþ
monomer. The degeneracy is again broken by the disor-
dered molecular environment. Without PT, the excited QW
has a similar characteristic as the 1b2 orbital in liquid water
and is mainly localized on the so-called Eigen complex
(H3Oþ), as shown in Fig. 2(l). In particular, a large orbital
amplitude is also found on the three water molecules along
the direction of donated H bonds by H3Oþ. The QW then
decays rapidly to zero in the second solvation shell and
beyond. As a result, the excitation is a hydronium defect
state with 1b2 character that is localized on the H9Oþ
4
complex, which is also the so-called strongly solvated
Eigen cation [28]. In the process of PT, the current simu-
lation is consistent with the widely accepted Grottuss
diffusion mechanism [1]. The proton exchange takes place
by the interconversion between the Eigen and Zundal
(H5Oþ
2 ) complex [1]. Not surprisingly, the locality of the
QW also swifts from the Eigen to the Zundal complex
during PT, as shown in Figs. 2(l) and 2(n), respectively.
Interestingly, a signiﬁcant weight is also found to be cen-
tered on the transferring proton connecting both the proton
receiving and donating structures, which gives a unique
signal for PT in the electronic structure. Similar to the PT
process of hydrated OH, the delocalized H3Oþ defect
state is much more easily hybridized with solvent H2O
molecules. As a result, in Fig. 3(b), we observe a redshift of
the IPs into the 1b2 region of bulk water which gets
broadened simultaneously.
Interestingly, a comparison of the IPs between these two
ion solutions reveals that the main feature of hydrated
H3Oþ has a much broader distribution than that of OH.
We attribute it to the difference in orbital characters. For
the hydrated H3Oþ excitation with the 1b2 characteristic,
the covalent orbital on an OH bond is easily perturbed
by the H-bond network of liquid water. On the other hand,
the excitation of hydrated OH is of lone pair character
and only centered on oxygen atom, which will be much
less affected by the embedded H-bond network. This is
also consistent with the observation that the 1b1 peak is
also narrower than the 1b2 peak in liquid water [29].
Besides the main features, the excitations of hydrated
ions are also found in Fig. 1 within the 3a1 region of bulk
water for both solutions. However, the signals are much
weaker and broadly distributed. Nevertheless, the IPs of
hydrated ions should still be assigned to the molecular
excitation of the same 3a1 symmetry, which are the second
and ﬁrst excitation of OH and H3Oþ monomers, respec-
tively. In Figs. 4(a) and 4(d), we present the typical QW
densities of 3a1 excitations as a function of distance from
the solvated OH and H3Oþ, respectively. For compari-
son, the same quantities of the main feature are also shown
in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). Clearly, in both ion solutions, the
less prominent IPs of 3a1 character originate from rela-
tively delocalized QWs, in which a large orbital amplitude
falls into the second solvation shell and beyond. On the
contrary, QWs of the main features of both hydrated
ions are defect states strongly localized within the ﬁrst
solvation shell. As a result, the total integrated charge
density converges to one electron much more rapidly as a
function of increased distance from the ions, as shown in

087801-3Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). The delocalized QWs indicate a
stronger hybridization with the water solution and result
in the observed broader and weaker ion excitations.
Finally, we draw our attention to the energy range where
the least IP signals have been found. They are the 1b2 and
1b1 regions of bulk water for hydrated OH and H3Oþ,
respectively. Again, this can be understood by the symme-
try of electron excitation of both ions at the monomer level.
The electronic conﬁgurations of OH and H3Oþ ions are
intrinsically different from that of a single water molecule.
For the OH monomer, the three lowest allowed valence
excitations are the two degenerated excitations of 1b1
character, followed by one of 3a1 character, in which the
1b2-like orbital in water is not allowed by symmetry. On
the other hand, the three lowest valence excitations in
H3Oþ ions are ones with 3a1 character, followed by two
degenerate states with 1b2 character, in which a 1b1 orbital
is forbidden. These symmetry restrictions result in the
absence of electron excitation for hydrated ions in the
above energy range.
In conclusion, the IP distributions of hydrated OH and
H3Oþ are studied by accurate quasiparticle theory. The
excitations of solvated ions can be assigned to molecular
electron excitation, however, strongly perturbed by the
solvation structures. Although the main features of IPs
are determined by their stable conﬁgurations, the proton
transfer does introduce a change of position and distribu-
tions of electron excitation in both hydrated ions. We
suggest that the excitation change due to PT can be
detected by isotope effects in future PES measurements
on solvated H3Oþ and D3Oþ [30]. Finally, we comment
that the leftover mismatch between experiment and
theory could be further reduced by more accurate liquid
structures considering both dispersion force [31–33] and

[26] Individual IPs were calculated by projecting the QWs onto
a real-space sphere of 1.5 A˚ [15] centered on the O atom
while in a stable complex and centered on the transferring
proton during PT. Conﬁgurations are considered to be in a
proton transfer event when a single Hþ could not be
associated with any oxygen molecules. The IPs of hy-
drated ions are ampliﬁed by a factor of 10 in order to
increase their visibility. The identities of both the OH
and the H3Oþ are determined by counting the number of
Hþ inside a covalent radius of 1.17 A˚ for each oxygen
atom in a given conﬁguration. Those oxygens containing
one or three H atoms within their covalent radius are
referred to as O and determine both OH and H3Oþ,
respectively.
[27] We want to stress here that the IPs for both solvated ions
are averaged over 100 conﬁgurations, weighted to include
both PT and non-PT conﬁgurations, and sampled during
the 25 ps equilibrium trajectory. PT conﬁgurations account
for 10% of the total OH conﬁgurations and 16% of
the H3Oþ conﬁgurations.

[38] The static GW is found to slightly overestimate the IP
[14,36], which can be corrected by frequency dependence
in the GW method.

riencing a PT (in its stable conﬁguration) are deﬁned by

as  ¼ jROH  ROwHj, where ROH and ROwH are the

likely to produce a PT, and  ¼ 0 indicates that the shared
