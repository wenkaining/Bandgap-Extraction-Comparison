Volume shrinkage, grain growth, and their interaction are major events occurring during free sintering of ceramics. 
A high temperature sintering dilatometry curve is influenced by these both phenomena. It is shown that the 
continuum theory of sintering can be utilized in the format enabling the extraction of the maximum amount of 
information on the densification and grain growth kinetics based on a simple dilatometry test. We present here the 
capability of such a fast approach (Dilatometry based Grain growth Assessment DGA) utilized for the modeling of 
sintering and grain growth of zirconia. 
Keywords: sintering; grain growth; dilatometry; densification kinetics; regression method 
I. Introduction 
During free sintering of ceramics the grain growth usually occurs at the final stage of processing when relative 
density is close to 90 %. When grain growth starts, it affects the densification kinetics because the grain size has a 
direct influence on the length of the diffusional path and on the capillary forces that govern sintering. In 
consequence, the grain growth slows down the densification of the powder specimen at the final stage of sintering. 
Conversely, the sintering has also an influence on the grain growth kinetics given that the porosity or the segregation 
of impurities may reduce the grain growth rate [1,2]. Previously it was shown that taking into account the grain 
growth improves the final density predictions by a sintering model describing spark plasma sintering experiments 
[3,4]. Accurate assessment of the grain growth, highly active at the end of sintering, is of great importance because 
grain growth favors residual porosity and may reduce the mechanical properties of the processed material. In other 
advanced sintering approaches, controlling the grain growth/densification behavior (also called sintering trajectory) 
is the key issue. These approaches include the two-step sintering method which prescribes the optimized processing 
thermal history to reduce the final grain size, the pressure and/or field assisted sintering, such as spark plasma 
sintering, which highly improves the retention of the small grain size microstructures [5,6]. The modeling of both 
densification and grain growth is therefore of high interest for these techniques. In the present study, the full 
extraction of the densification and grain growth constitutive parameters is conducted based on a simple free 
sintering dilatometry curve for zirconia. Such an analysis is made possible due to the developed specific formulation 
based on the continuum theory of sintering [7] adopted for the description of the material constitutive behavior at the 
intermediate and final stages of sintering. 
II. Theory and method 
Free sintering can be modelled analytically via the following equation of the continuum theory of sintering [7]: 
 =

where  is the sintering stress whose expression is detailed in the third term, () is the material viscosity,  is the 
bulk modulus,  is the porosity,  is the surface energy and  is the grain radius. 
This equation can be reformulated to extract the temperature dependent viscosity () and the surface energy  for 
the intermediate sintering stage using the regression equation: 
 =  (

where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, " and # are the Arrhenius pre-exponential viscosity 
constant and activation energy, respectively. 
At the final sintering stage, when the grain growth occurs, the interaction between the sintering stress  and grain 
growth slowdowns the sintering kinetics [4]. Based on this assumption and using a specific formulation of the 
continuum theory of sintering, it is possible to estimate the grain size evolution during the final stage of sintering via 
the middle term of the following equation (knowing

where, % is the grain diameter, 6" and #3	are the grain growth Arrhenius preexponential constant and activation

parameters (6" and #3). Knowing the estimated grain size at the final stage of sintering, it is finally possible to 
determine the grain growth kinetic parameters using the new regression equation:

III. Experimental procedure 
The sintering in air of Tosoh zirconia (TZ-3YS-E, 50 nm) powder has been carried out in the dilatometer (Unitherm 
model 1161, Anter Corporation). The sintering curves have been calculated using the sampleâ€™s shrinkage and tooling 
thermal expansion curves (see Figure 1a). A 5 K/min ramping cycle up to 1700 Â°C is chosen to ensure the sintering 
up to high density and with the pronounced grain growth. The sample has been prepared by cold isostatic pressing at 
400 MPa without binder to ensure a good initial packing of the powder. 
IV. Results and discussion 
The densification curve reported in Figure 1a shows, as expected, the sintering slowdown that appears in the 87-
95 % (relative density) region. Assuming that the densification deceleration, that happens earlier than the full 
density is achieved, is caused by the grain growth interaction with the densification, the sintering constitutive 
parameters can be determined using the following step by step procedure. At the first stage, the densification 
parameters are determined through the regression equation (2) for the kinetic curve region not influenced by the 
grain growth (between 55 and 87% of the relative density). The regression graph Y vs 1/(RT) reported in Figure 1b 
gives values of Ao = 22.67 Pa m2 s K-1 J-1 and Q = 220.1 kJ/mol. The resulting densification model without grain 
growth (reported in Figure 1c) explains well the densification behavior at the intermediate stage of sintering, but the 
sintering slowdown during the final stage is not reproduced. The strategy of equation (3) is to estimate the grain 
growth accounting for the difference between the relative density at the sintering final stage predicted by the 
classical model and the experimentally obtained relative density value (which is lower). This gives the graph of the 
estimated G vs T (Figure.1b) via equation (3). Finally, knowing G and %, it is possible to determine the grain growth 
parameters (6" and #3) using the regression equation (4). The regression graph YG vs 1/(RT) (reported in Figure 1b) 
exhibits two trends of the grain growth behavior. In the temperature range of 1700-1850K (zone 1) we obtained3 
 
6" = 1.100E+25 m4/s and #3 = 1879 kJ/mol, while in the temperature range of 1850-1973K (zone 2) these values 
evolve to 6" = 2.741E-14 m4/s and #3 = 514.4 kJ/mol. The values of QG in zone 2 are close to the grain growth 
activation energy earlier reported (520 kJ/mol [8], 584 kJ/mol [9]). This seems to show the two mechanisms of the 
grain growth: in zone 1 the grain growth is disturbed by the high level of porosity and shows the higher activation 
energy than the second mechanism in zone 2 where the activation energy matches the literature data [8,9]. 
Finally, the new sintering constitutive model (Figure 1c) describes well the densification during the initial, 
intermediate and final stages of sintering. The modeling of the grain growth reported in Figure 1d shows a good 
agreement between the two calculations approaches: one based on equations (1) and (3) and the other one based on 
the combination of equations (1) and (4). 
IV. Conclusions 
The developed approach shows that the identification of the major sintering and grain growth constitutive 
parameters can be conducted concurrently using a simple dilatometry curve. This becomes possible due to an 
optimized analysis of the intermediate (densification only) and final (densification and grain growth) sintering 
kinetics. The sintering/grain growth modeling successfully predicts the significant reduction of the densification rate 
during the final stage of sintering due to the grain growth. The grain growth exhibits two distinct stages: a transient 
stage for the high level of porosity, and the final stage (that appears after 91 % of the relative density is reached) at 
which the grain growth impacts the regular sintering kinetics. It should be noted that the developed method 
identifies the grain growth kinetics specifically during the final stage of sintering; therefore, the determined 
constitutive parameters are restricted to this small experimental domain. Nevertheless, the simplicity of this 
approach makes it useful for the refinement of the densification model for the final stage of sintering where the 
densification slowdown due to the grain growth is very common. This method can be also applied to obtain the grain 
growth kinetics from the dilatometry data.
