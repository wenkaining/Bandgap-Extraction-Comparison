In this paper, strain transfer efﬁciencies from a single crystalline piezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-
lead titanate substrate to a GaAs semiconductor membrane bonded on top are investigated using
state-of-the-art x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and ﬁnite-element-method (FEM) simulations. Two
different bonding techniques are studied, namely, gold-thermo-compression and polymer-based SU8
bonding. Our results show a much higher strain-transfer for the “soft” SU8 bonding in comparison to
the “hard” bonding via gold-thermo-compression. A comparison between the XRD results and FEM
simulations allows us to explain this unexpected result with the presence of complex interface structures
between the different layers. V

I. INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials have gained importance in terms
of reversibly transferring strain to other materials, especially
semiconductors, for the purpose of tuning the electrical and
optical properties.1,2
The magnitude of strain induced in this way is directly
proportional to the electric ﬁeld applied across the piezoelectric
material, making use of the converse piezoelectric effect.3 In
the past several years, devices using this approach have been
extensively studied to tune the optical emission spectra of
direct band-gap semiconductors.2,4–10 The design of these devi-
ces has become more and more reﬁned, which ﬁnally allows
the choice of the preferred orientation of the transferred
strain.8,9,11 The techniques used to bond the semiconductor on
the piezoelectric substrate are mostly gold-thermo-compression
or bonding mediated by a comparatively “soft” polymer.
One of the major issues for an efﬁcient strain transfer
between the piezoelectric substrate and the semiconductor
membrane seems to be the stiffness of the bonding interlayer
which is mainly determined by the material’s Young’s modu-
lus. In this regard, a good choice is to bond the membrane
with a gold interlayer by gold-thermo-compression bonding.12
However, relatively high mechanical pressures of about
10 MPa are usually required to ensure a good bonding quality.
This is especially relevant when working with fragile sub-
strates or complex device layouts where mechanical pressures
in the order of only 1 kPa would be desirable (see Ref. 8). A
convenient “soft” approach is based on polymer-based SU8
bonding with a relatively high Young modulus in the order of
about 5 GPa when thermally treated at temperatures above
180 C. In addition, the SU8 polymer is commonly used as
a photoresist for many processes involving lithography and
bonding.13–16
Here, we investigate the strain transfer capabilities of
gold and SU8 bonding interlayers by x-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements on 330-nm-thick GaAs membranes bonded on
single crystalline piezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead
titanate (PMN-PT) piezo-actuators. The strain transfer is ana-
lyzed by simultaneously acquiring the XRD reciprocal space
maps (RSMs) of the bonded semiconductor ﬁlm and the
underlying single crystalline PMN-PT for different electric
ﬁelds applied to the PMN-PT substrate. The results presented
in this work provide in-depth understanding of the assets
and weaknesses of the gold-thermo-compression and SU8
bonding techniques for an optimized exploitation of hybrid
semiconductor-piezoelectric devices.
II. SAMPLE LAYOUT AND FABRICATION
The investigated devices are composed of a stack of three
individual parts and share a common layout. The ﬁrst layer is a
gold-plated AlN chip carrier for electrically contacting the
device, followed by the piezoelectric actuator consisting of a
225-lm-thick PMN-PT substrate and, as a third layer, the
330nm thick GaAs membrane on top; cross-sections of the
devices can be seen in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.
The piezoelectric material PMN-PT with the composition
of [Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3]0.71-[PbTiO3]0.29 is used due to its high
piezoelectric coupling coefﬁcients, compared to other com-
monly used ferroelectrics, such as lead-zirconate-titanate
(PZT) and lead-zirconate-niobate (PZN).17,18 It also presents
good piezoelectric response at cryogenic temperatures, which
is very interesting for fundamental studies.19,20 The single
crystalline PMN-PT in general has a perovskite structure,21
and in the composition that was used, x-ray diffraction meas-
urements showed that the material was in a monoclinic phase22

JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 121, 135303 (2017)with measured lattice constants of a ¼ b ¼ 5.68 6 0.01 A˚ and
c¼ 4.03 6 0.01 A˚ .
The ﬁrst fabrication step is the metallization of the
PMN-PT substrate on both sides by depositing a [Cr (10 nm)
- Au (100 nm)] bi-layer for electrical contacting. The mem-
brane is part of a multilayer structure [GaAs[001] substrate -
Al0.7Ga0.3As(50 nm) - GaAs (330 nm) membrane], which is
epitaxially grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and then
coated by thermal evaporation with the same [Cr (10 nm) - Au
(100 nm)] bi-layer. This layer serves both as a bonding layer
and for protection of the membrane during the processing. In
addition, the metallization of the semiconductor layer increases
the spectral emission efﬁciency by acting as a mirror, which is
important for optical measurements.
The next step is the bonding procedure, where the multi-
layer structure containing the GaAs membrane is bonded on
the PMN-PT substrate via gold-thermo-compression or SU8
bonding. In the case of gold-thermo-compression bonding,
the semiconductor layer and the piezoelectric substrate are
pressed together with a pressure of 10 MPa and is simulta-
neously heated up to 300 C for 30 min to enhance inter-
diffusion of the gold layers and thus to form a uniform
bonding layer between both parts. For the SU8 bonding, the
semiconductor sample is coated with a 500 nm thick SU8
polymer by spin-coating and baked for 5 min at 90 C to
evaporate solvents present in as-spinned SU8. Speciﬁcally,
we have used SU8-2000.5 from Micro Resist Technology
GmbH with a viscosity of 2.49 cSt and a density of 1.070 g/ml.
Then, the semiconductor is pressed against the PMN-PT sub-
strate by applying a comparatively small mechanical pressure
of about 10 kPa while keeping a temperature of about 220 C
for 15 min. This step is conducted above the glass-transition-
temperature23 and hardens the SU8 for an efﬁcient bonding. It
should be mentioned that a void-free bonding layer is expected
when using SU8, as all possible gaps between the gold-coated
piezoelectric- and semiconductor-layers are ﬁlled during the
bonding process, while the SU8 is still “liquid” before the ﬁnal
baking step.
After bonding, the GaAs membrane is released from the
grown multilayer structure onto the PMN-PT substrate by
back-etching. This process consists of three steps: (i) rough
non-selective chemical etching of most of the GaAs sub-
strates with H3PO4: H2O2 (7:3); (ii) removal of the remain-
ing GaAs substrate down to the Al0.7Ga0.3As sacriﬁcial layer
by selective etching with citric acid: H2O2 (4:1); and (iii)
etching of the Al0.7Ga0.3As layer by dipping in hydroﬂuoric
acid (HF - 49%). More details on the device fabrication can
be found in Ref. 9.
Finally, the PMN-PT with the bonded GaAs membrane
on top was glued with silver paint onto an AlN chip carrier
(for the ﬁnal sample, see Fig. 1(c)). Cross sections of the dif-
ferently bonded samples are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). To
operate the piezoelectric device, it is necessary ﬁrst to pole the
piezoelectric substrate properly. This is done by applying a
voltage on top of the substrate progressively in steps of 1 V up
to a total voltage of 150 V. This leads to a ferroelectric order-
ing of the polarization in the PMN-PT domains. After poling,
the applied electric ﬁeld can either be parallel to the net-
polarization of the piezoelectric domains or it can point in the
opposite direction (anti-parallel). Since the piezo actuator is
processed in such a way that it is working in the longitudinal
extension mode along the [001], respectively, the z-direction,
an electric ﬁeld parallel to the net-polarization results in an
expansion perpendicular to the surface and an in-plane con-
traction. Applying the electric ﬁeld in the opposite direction
results in a contraction along the z-direction and an in-plane
expansion, as long as the coercive ﬁeld (2 kV/cm for the
used material) is not exceeded. To avoid such unintentional
re-poling, all experiments were carried out in the ﬁrst conﬁgu-
ration with the electric ﬁeld parallel to the polarization direc-
tion, i.e., inducing compressive in-plane strains.

monochromator.
The
sample
was
mounted on a 6-axis diffractometer (manufactured by Huber
diffraction GmbH) with the possibility to apply high voltage
to the sample during XRD measurements. All experiments
were performed in co-planar scattering geometry with a high
incidence and low exit angle to achieve a small beam foot-
print on the sample. The CuKa1line was used with the corre-
sponding wavelength of k ¼ 1.5406 A˚ . A ﬁnal shaping of the
beam was achieved by using adjustable slits, resulting in a
beam size of 0.5  0.5 mm2.
Reciprocal space maps (RSMs) around the [004] and
[224] Bragg peaks of GaAs (on-top) and the [002] and [113]
Bragg peaks of PMN-PT underneath were recorded using a
position sensitive detector (Bruker VANTEC 1). Details on
reciprocal space and XRD can be found in Ref. 24. All
reﬂections were recorded without changing the geometry or
moving the sample in the beam. This offered the advantage
that a direct comparison of the strain induced in the PMN-PT
and on the corresponding area on top, in the GaAs mem-
brane, could be measured simultaneously. For each voltage
(corresponding to a certain electric ﬁeld applied across the
piezo), RSMs of the GaAs and PMN-PT reﬂections were
recorded. Then, the voltage was increased in a range between
0V and 200V with a step size of 25V. After each voltage ramp
(e.g., 0V–25V at 1V/s), there was a break of about 20min,
which was needed to limit drifting effects of the PMN-PT25 that
could result in a blurring of the Bragg-peaks.
To extract the lattice parameters and hence the strain in
each material (GaAs or PMN-PT), the ﬁrst step was a tilt
correction applied to all RSMs by shifting the symmetric
peak positions to the x ¼ 2h/2 condition. For this purpose,
the center-of-mass (COM) position (~
QCOM) from the sym-
metric RSMs [004] and [002] was calculated, as described
by the following equation:
~
QCOM ¼ 1

Ii ~
Qi:
Itot is the total integrated intensity of the RSM and the vector
~
Qi is one deﬁned position in the RSM with the corresponding
intensity Ii and the index i counting all measured positions
in the q-space. The angle between the calculated ~
QCOM posi-
tion for the sym. RSMs and the crystalline direction (~Qjj
[001]) was used as a x-offset. This calculated offset was also
applied to the asymmetric [224] and [113] RSMs, respec-
tively. After the tilt correction, a second COM calculation
was performed for the asymmetric RSMs [224] and [113] to
ﬁnd the Q-in-plane component, which was ﬁnally used for
evaluation of the in-plane lattice parameters and the corre-
sponding in-plain strain values. Fig. 2 shows RSMs of GaAs
and PMN-PT and the corresponding calculated ~
QCOM posi-
tions for different voltages applied.
Due to inhomogeneities in terms of pre-strains (see Ref. 9)
and tilts after bonding (which can be seen in the RSMs as
peak-broadening, distortions, or side maxima), using the
COM calculation was necessary to reproducibly track the
parts in the RSMs which are related to strain changes upon
bias variations. This is especially true for the RSMs of the
thin GaAs membrane on-top, where most of the inhomoge-
neities are induced during the bonding procedure. The
peak-broadening in the RSMs measured for PMN-PT is
attributed to the presence of multiple domains with a small
but ﬁnite angular orientation distribution (“mosaicity”) in
the order of 0.2 within the illuminated area(see Fig. 2).
Peak-width effects are the main contribution to the error of
the measured strain component. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images taken from the polished PMN-PT surface
are discussed in detail in Section IV and conﬁrm the pres-
ence of these domains.
IV. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND SIMULATIONS
Summarizing the results from the XRD measurements,
in Fig. 3 the changes of the in-plane strain component for
both bonding techniques and different electric ﬁelds applied
can be seen. The strain changes in the bonded GaAs mem-
brane are for both bonding techniques lower than the ones
measured in the PMN-PT actuator which indicates that the
strain transfer is not perfect, i.e., the ratio of the strain
changes is smaller than 100%. By calculating a linear regres-
sion for each set of data-points, a characteristic slope (De/F)
can be obtained which makes it possible to quantify the
strain transfer rates. The calculated slopes with their corre-
sponding errors and the transfer efﬁciencies (TEs) (strain
induced in the PMN-PT actuator equals 100%) are given in
Table I. Interestingly, the sample bonded via the SU8 coating
shows a much higher transfer efﬁciency (69%) than for gold
thermo-compression bonding (25%) although the Young’s
modulus of hardened SU8 (2–4 GPa26) is about 20 times
lower than the modulus of a thin gold layer (60–70 GPa27).
This seems counterintuitive in the ﬁrst place, as one might
think that a harder layer results in a higher strain transfer,
while the opposite is observed here. The bonding efﬁciency
is actually very sensitive to the interface properties which
will be discussed below and just looking at the material
parameters is not sufﬁcient to understand and model the
strain transfer correctly. We note that an almost complete
strain-transfer was previously reported for epoxy-glued sam-
ples in Ref. 1, although the reached strain levels were about
an order of magnitude lower than those achieved here.
Finite-element-method (FEM) simulations for different
materials used as bonding layers and various interface-
structures were performed to allow a deeper understanding
of the strain losses. The ﬁrst step was to transfer the device
to an idealized model by rebuilding each individual layer
using the appropriate elastic material constants and preserv-
ing the original length scales of the device. The material
parameters were taken for: PMN-PT from Ref. 28; the poly-
mer SU8 from Ref. 23; the thin gold layers from Ref. 27, and
the GaAs layer from Ref. 29. All materials used were
assumed to be linear-elastic.
Interestingly, the choice of the material mediating the
bonding process (gold or SU8) had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the simulated strain transferred from the piezo to the
semiconductor, assuming perfectly bonded interfaces. The
strain transfer is always 100%. Even for much softer
135303-3
Ziss et al.
J. Appl. Phys. 121, 135303 (2017)hypothetic bonding materials such as rubber-like silicone
polymers30 (Young’s Moduli of about two orders of magni-
tude lower than the Modulus of SU8), no signiﬁcant strain
losses could be observed in the FEM simulations. This, on
ﬁrst sight counter-intuitive, behaviour can be understood
considering the dimensions of the structure in terms of
length scales. If the layer-thickness is much smaller than
the lateral dimensions of the structure (which is the case
here, since layer thicknesses are in the range of 107 m
while lateral dimensions are about 103 m), the elastic
strain induced and transferred by the individual layers has
no possibility to relax except in the edge regions of the
structure. Hence, only at the edges (on length scales similar
to the top layer thicknesses) signiﬁcant strain losses are
observed due to elastic relaxations, whereas in the sample
center the strain is transferred without any losses from the
piezo carrier to the semiconductor membrane, regardless of
the materials used for bonding. Strain relaxation is thus rel-
evant only close to structure edges31 or for structures with a
high aspect ratio.10 This is of course true only within the
elastic limit, i.e., if no plastic relaxations or crack forma-
tions occur. For Au bonding, this should be the case for the
material constants and strain ranges in the order of 0.1%.
For SU8, we will discuss this limit below.
In Fig. 4, simulations of the strain transfer efﬁciency
(TE) for the in-plane strain component along the surface can
be seen. The edge effect is clearly visible, whereas the bulk
is strained uniformly. The strain transfer efﬁciency is quanti-
ﬁed by color-coding the relative difference of a strain com-
ponent (eyy) in the GaAs and PMN-PT which is given by

eyy(Simulation) is the simulated strain value and eyy(PMN-
PT) the strain induced in the PMN-PT substrate. For the
maximum of 100% strain transfer, eyy(Simulation) equals
eyy(PMN-PT).
In contrast to the simulations, the measured strain losses
for the bulk are considerable and can be explained by a more
complicated interface structure. For this purpose, AFM
measurements of the PMN-PT surface before and after gold
coating were performed and revealed a domain-like structure
even though the PMN-PT is purchased as a single crystalline
material. This domain-like structure appears after the surface
of the piezo material is polished to reduce the initial rough-
ness and is also responsible for the mosaicity observed in
XRD. The metallization of the piezo crystal does not bury or

duces the PMN-PT surface texture on the surface of the 100-
nm-thick gold layer, as shown in Fig. 5. The lateral size of a
single domain is in the range of 1 lm with a peak-to-valley
height of about 4–6 nm. This could lead to void areas, when
the two Au-coated surfaces are brought into contact during
the bonding process, resulting in a bonding surface area sig-
niﬁcantly below 100%. SEM images of cross-sections
through gold bonded devices fabricated in the same way
can be found in Ref. 4 and clearly conﬁrm the presence of
void areas where no bonding could be established. Thus,
qualitative simulations on imperfect bonding interfaces were
performed to explore the effect of strain losses due to void
areas. In Fig. 6, simulations of a rough surface and its effect
on the transfer efﬁciency can be seen. The rough surfaces
have been qualitatively reproduced replacing the perfect
bonding-layers by a regular pattern of truncated pyramids on
both bonding faces. The top areas of the truncated pyramids
from the gold-coated piezo and the mirrored ones from the
gold-coated semiconductor are assumed to be in perfect con-
tact, whereas the area between the truncated pyramids repre-
sents the voids. By changing the size of the top facets of the
truncated pyramids, it is possible to continuously simulate a

ator and the GaAs membrane versus electric ﬁeld, for gold bonding (a) and
SU8 bonding (b). The areas marked in red represent the loss in strain. The
error for the given strain values is around 0.02% and is mainly dominated by
the ﬁnite peak widths in the RSMs due to mosaicity in the piezo actuator
and the bonded GaAs.

strain from the PMN-PT piezo carrier to the GaAs membrane on-top are
observed in the edge regions. The effect of strain loss is observed for all
edges but only the strain component (eyy) along the y-axis is plotted which
explains the asymmetry. For a perfectly bonded device, as shown, the
observed losses along the edges are only a few tenth of a percent, see colour
scale. The piezo actuator was set to a compressive strain of 0.1%, which
was the maximum measured strain (at 200 V applied bias).

Ziss et al.
J. Appl. Phys. 121, 135303 (2017)global bonding ratio between 100% (perfect bonding, whole
area in contact) and 0% (no bonding established). The void
parts or inhomogeneities introduced with the pyramid-like
surface pattern create “micro-edge” effects on every imper-
fect bonding domain and allow a partial relaxation of the
induced strain. That is why the presence of defects or inho-
mogeneities is crucial for the relaxation of strain and hence
to explain the losses in transferred strain. The effect of bond-
ing inhomogeneities on the transferred strain can be seen in
Fig. 7, which reveals that the transfer efﬁciencies are directly
correlated with the bonded area. Based on our experimental
ﬁndings, enhanced gold-bonding quality should be possible
by decreasing the surface roughness of the PMN-PT sub-
strate before bonding, i.e., the height difference between the
individual domains. In principle, this could be achieved by
employing polishing liquids presenting pH factors of 2 as
recently demonstrated.32 Other approaches may be viable,
such as performing the mechanical polishing of an already
poled PMN-PT substrate.
Hence in the case of gold-bonding, the losses in strain can
be very well explained by a reduction of the effective bonding
area due to the intrinsic domain structure of the piezo carrier
and a possible additional roughness induced during gold depo-
sition. The efﬁciency of strain transfer for a particular sample
depends, however, on the particular details of the bonding sur-
faces and cannot be easily predicted quantitatively.
For the SU8 bonded samples, the domain structure of
the piezo substrate should not have any inﬂuence because
the liquid SU8 could compensate the surface roughness by
ﬁlling up all gaps, qualitatively explaining a higher strain
transfer. However, also for SU8 bonding, the strain transfer
is signiﬁcantly below 100%, i.e., also in this case, the bond-
ing layer cannot be homogeneous and continuous. Taking a
closer look at the stress components in the bonding layer for
measured values of strain induced in the piezo material, one
can see that the elastic limit of the SU8 (65–100 MPa33) is
exceeded at the sample edges or “defects” in the interface.
We believe that any such defects or inhomogeneities must
trigger plastic deformation or the formation of small cracks,
i.e., lead to a certain degree of plastic relaxation. This most
probably occurs already during the ﬁrst poling of the device,
which needs to be done after the high temperature bonding
step where the Curie-temperature TC  127 of PMN-PT20
is exceeded. Afterwards, the partly plastically relaxed SU8
layer behaves elastically. I.e., during cycling the applied
voltage several times over the full range the same strain state
is reached for the same applied bias reproducibly. A direct
conﬁrmation of this assumption, e.g., by SEM inspection of
cross-section specimen is difﬁcult since the interfaces are
hard to access while the devices are working. Further investi-
gations are currently in progress.
FIG. 6. Simulations of the in-plane strain (eyy) transfer efﬁciency (TE) for a patterned bonding layer with an array of truncated pyramids mimicking a rough
surface. In the simulation shown in the left panel, only 10% of the total area contributes to the bonding. The size of one bonding element in this simulation is
about 1 lm  1 lm, which is in the range of the measured domain-sizes; the total lateral model size was reduced due to limited computing power. The reduc-
tion of the lateral dimensions leads, as expected, to very prominent edge effects visible along the y-direction for the simulated strain component eyy.
Nevertheless, also in the centre of the structures an overall reduction of the transferred in-plane strain can be observed.
FIG. 7. Average strain transfer obtained from a volume-integration in the
GaAs layer over the region (12 lm  12 lm) marked in the inset which is
not affected by the edge effect. The plot is normalized to 100% strain
transfer at 100% bonding area to further eliminate any remainder of edge
relaxation effects. The plot conﬁrms that a reduction of the bonding area
due to domain-like bonding elements leads to substantial losses in trans-
ferred strain.

X-ray diffraction measurements clearly show that the
devices fabricated with SU8 as the bonding layer show a supe-
rior efﬁciency in terms of strain transfer compared to the devi-
ces fabricated with gold-thermo-compression. Considering the
different material constants, the measurements seem to be
counter-intuitive: a “softer” bonding layer leads to higher
transferred strains. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that
the measured strain transfer rates of 70% for the devices
with the “soft” SU8 bonding layer are higher than the transfer
rates reported for semiconductor-layers epitaxially grown on
PMN-PT substrates (17%;34 40%35), and in the same range as
for epitaxially grown La0.335Pr0.335Ca0.33MnO3 (34 nm thick)
layers (71%36). This comparison highlights the capabilities
of the SU8 bonding technique, since even epitaxially grown
layers with a thickness 10 times lower than the GaAs mem-
brane used in this work do not show signiﬁcantly higher
strain-transfer efﬁciencies.
Simulations on differently modelled bonding-layer-sur-
faces revealed that the interface structure is actually more
important than the material parameters of the bonding layer.
These imperfect interface structures can explain the mea-
sured losses in the transferred strain even if detailed quantita-
tive simulations are not possible due to the interface
complexity. Nevertheless, these simulations still allow a
deeper understanding of processes involved during the bond-
ing and reveal the reasons for losses in transferred strain.
Each of the studied devices is, of course, individually
fabricated, and simpliﬁed simulation on these devices cannot
fully predict their behaviour. Therefore, for determining the
exact amount of strain transferred, direct strain measure-
ments via independent methods such as x-ray diffraction are
obligatory.
