We have studied the electronic and magnetic structures of the ternary iron arsenides AFe2As2 (A = Ba,
Ca, or Sr) using the ﬁrst-principles density functional theory. The ground states of these compounds
are in a collinear antiferromagnetic order, resulting from the interplay between the nearest and the
next-nearest neighbor superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions bridged by As 4p orbitals. The
correction from the spin–orbit interaction to the electronic band structure is given. The pressure can
reduce dramatically the magnetic moment and diminish the collinear antiferromagnetic order. Based
on the calculations, we propose that the low energy dynamics of these materials can be described
eﬀectively by a t–JH–J1–J2-type model [arXiv: 0806.3526v2, 2008].

Introduction
The recent discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO
by partial substitution of O with F atoms below 26 K [2]
has stimulated great interest on the investigation of the
physical properties of iron-based pnictides.
This type
of quaternary compounds consists of alternative tetra-
hedral FeAs and LaO layers along the c-axis. The LaO
layers act mainly as a charge reservoir. The supercon-
ducting pairing occurs in the FeAs layers.
More re-
cently, it was reported that the ternary iron-based ar-
senides AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) become supercon-
ducting upon hole or electron doping [3–6]. Similar as in
LaFeAsO [7, 8], these ternary iron arsenides also exhibit
a spin-density-wave-like anomaly and a structural tran-
sition from the tetragonal I4/mmm to the orthorhombic
Fmmm group at some temperature between 140 K and
200 K [9, 10]. Furthermore, it was found that the high
pressures can drive these undoped ternary iron arsenides
to be superconducting [11–13].
To investigate the mechanism of superconductivity in
these materials, it is commonly believed that one needs
to understand ﬁrst the electronic and magnetic struc-
tures of the parent compounds. It has been shown that

151
there is an essential similarity of electronic states near
the Fermi level in AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) and
LaFeAsO by studying the nonmagnetic state [1, 14].
Moreover, the density of states at the Fermi energy is
only weakly doping dependent and the main eﬀect of
doping is a change in the relative sizes of the electron
and hole Fermi surfaces [15].
In this paper, we report the electronic structures and
magnetic orders and properties of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca,
or Sr) obtained from the ﬁrst-principles electronic struc-
ture calculations. By comparison of the energy of the
non-magnetic state with those of a number of magnetic
ordered states, we ﬁnd that, similar as in LaFeAsO, the
ground state of AFe2As2 is in a collinear antiferromag-
netic order. We have also studied the spin-orbit inter-
action and the pressure eﬀect in these materials. The
electronic and magnetic structure is found to be strongly
aﬀected by the pressure eﬀect, but weakly by the spin-
orbit interaction.

Computational approach
AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) takes the ThCr2Si2 type
structure and an “A” layer plays a similar role as a LaO
layer in LaFeAsO. Although AFe2As2 can be considered
as a tetragonal crystal with two formula units included
in the corresponding unit cell as shown in Fig. 1(a), its
primitive unit cell is constructed by considering AFe2As2
as a triclinic crystal, in which only one formula unit cell
is included as shown in Fig. 1(b). In the calculations,
we adopted the primitive cell as calculation cell with the
experimental lattice constants as the input parameters.
In the calculation of the electronic structures of the non-
magnetic, the ferromagnetic and the square antiferro-
magnetic Neel states, the a × a FeAs cell is taken as the
base cell [shown in Fig. 1(c)]. In the calculation of the
collinear antiferromagnetic state, the unit cell is doubled
and the base cell is the

in Fig. 1(c).

collinear antiferromagnetic order are shown by arrows.
In our calculations the plane wave basis method was
used [16].
We used the generalized gradient approxi-
mation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof [17] for the
exchange-correlation potentials. The ultrasoft pseudopo-
tentials [18] were used to model the electron–ion interac-
tions. After the full convergence test, the kinetic energy
cut-oﬀand the charge density cut-oﬀof the plane wave
basis were chosen to be 600 eV and 4800 eV, respectively.
The Gaussian broadening technique was used and a mesh
of 16 × 16 × 8 k-points were sampled for the Brillouin-
zone integration. The internal atomic coordinates within
a cell were determined by the energy minimization.

Results and analysis
3.1
Nonmagnetic state
We ﬁrst studied the nonmagnetic state of the compound
AFe2As2 (A = Ba, Sr, or Ca), which is the high tem-
perature phase of these materials. The electronic band
structure of this state also provides a reference for study-
ing the low temperature magnetic phases.
This can
help us to understand the mechanism or the interactions
that drive the magnetic phase transition and the related
structural transition [19].
3.1.1
BaFe2As2
In our calculation, the experimental tetragonal crystal
lattice parameters a = b = 3.9625 ˚A and c = 13.0168
˚A [9] were adopted for BaFe2As2.
Figures 2 and 3
show the calculated density of states (DOS) of BaFe2As2
in the nonmagnetic, square antiferromagnetic Neel, and
collinear antiferromagnetic states, respectively.
As re-
vealed by Fig. 2(a), similar to LaFeAsO, the density of
states of BaFe2As2 consists of mainly the Fe-3d states
from –2 eV to 2 eV around the Fermi energy.
Fur-
ther analysis of the calculation [Fig. 3(a)] shows that
the crystal ﬁeld splitting of the Fe-3d orbitals is much
smaller than the one in transition metal oxides.
This
is not very surprising since the electronegativity of As
is much weaker than O. This suggests that the Fermi
surface may have the contribution from all the Fe-3d or-
bitals.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface
of BaFe2As2 in the nonmagnetic state are shown in Fig.
4.
As shown in Fig.
4(a), there are four Fermi sur-
face sheets, contributed from the four bands crossing the
Fermi energy [Fig. 4(a)]. Among them, the two cylinder-
like Fermi-surface sheets centered around X–P are from
the electron bands. They correspond to the two Fermi
surface sheets around M–A in LaFeAsO. The other two
Fermi surface sheets centered around Γ–Z are from the
hole bands. These results agree qualitatively with the152

experimental observation [20].
The energy dispersion of the electronic bands along
the c-axis is much larger than that in LaFeAsO [21, 22].
The sectional views parallel to (001) plane through Z
point and Γ point are diﬀerent due to the large disper-
sion [Figs. 4(c) and (d)]. There is one band just below
the Fermi energy along Γ–Z in Fig.
4(a), which cor-
responds to the third hole Fermi surface sheet given in
Ref.
[14].
The volumes enclosed by these Fermi sur-
face sheets are 0.26 electrons/cell and 0.26 holes/cell,
respectively.
The electron carrier concentration is the
same as the hole carrier concentration. Both are equal
to 2.54 × 1021/cm3. The compound BaFe2As2 is thus
a semimetal with a low carrier concentration between
normal metals and semiconductors, similar to what we
found in LaFeAsO [22].
The density of states at the
Fermi energy is 3.93 state per eV per formula unit cell.
The corresponding electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ
= 9.26 mJ/(K2 · mol) and the Pauli paramagnetic sus-
ceptibility χp = 1.60 × 10−9 m3/mol. These calculated
physical quantities are also summarized in Table 1, which
are well close to the experimental values [9, 23–26].

We study the plasma excitation in the semimetal
BaFe2As2 as well. The plasma frequency fp is computed
as follows:

where nh and ne are the hole and electron carrier densi-
ties, respectively and m∗
h and m∗
e are the eﬀective masses
of hole and electron, respectively. We use the second or-
der polynomial ﬁtting to estimate the eﬀective masses of
carriers from the calculated band structures. We obtain
the hole and electron eﬀective masses as m∗
e = 0.60me
and m∗
h = 0.86me with me being electron mass. Because
of the irregular and strongly anisotropic band structure,
the estimated eﬀective masses are with no small un-
certainty.
We then calculate the plasma frequency as
fp = 25 392 cm−1 in the nonmagnetic state. These val-
ues are also listed in Table 1 in comparison with the
available experimental values.

These two compounds have the same crystal structure.
The tetragonal crystal lattice constants determined by
experimental measurements are a = b = 3.9259 ˚A and
c = 12.375 ˚A for SrFe2As2 [4]. They are smaller than
the corresponding parameters for BaFe2As2, especially
along the c-axis. The electronic band structure and the
Fermi surface shown in Fig. 5, are similar as the ones
for BaFe2As2. The diﬀerence is that the band along Γ–
Z, which is just below the Fermi energy in BaFe2As2,
moves slightly upward and intersects with the Fermi
level.
This results in the third hole-type Fermi sheet
centered around Γ–Z.
Therefore, in SrFe2As2, there
are three hole-type and two electron-type Fermi surface
sheets.

k-point Z (c) and Γ (d) parallel to (001) plane. The symmetrical
k-points in the Brillouin zone are referred to Fig. 4(b).
The volumes enclosed by these Fermi sheets give 0.32
electrons/cell and 0.32 holes/cell for SrFe2As2.
The
electron (or hole) carrier concentration is about 3.33 ×
1021/cm3.
The density of states at the Fermi energy
is about 3.27 state per eV per formula unit. The cor-
responding electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient and Pauli
susceptibility are γ = 7.71 mJ/(K2 · mol) and χp =
1.33 × 10−9m3/mol, respectively. And the plasma fre-
quency fp is computed as about 27 386 cm−1.
These
calculated quantities are also reported in Table 1. The
total and Fe-3d projected density of states of SrFe2As2
are similar as the ones for BaFe2As2. The low energy ex-
citations are also dominated by Fe-3d orbitals from −2
eV to 2 eV around the Fermi energy.
3.1.3
CaFe2As2
The tetragonal crystal lattice parameters obtained by
experiments [26], a = b = 3.912 ˚A and c = 11.667 ˚A, are
used in our calculation for CaFe2As2. Figure 6 shows the
electronic band structure and the Fermi surface. Similar
to SrFe2As2, there are three hole-type and two electron-
type Fermi surface sheets for CaFe2As2.
Because the
third hole-type Fermi surface of CaFe2As2 expands into
a cylinder-like shape centered around Γ–Z, the cross
section through Γ and X in (001) plane has one more
cutting line than that of SrFe2As2. From the volumes en-
closed by these Fermi sheets, we determine the electron
and hole concentrations are 0.38 electrons/cell and 0.38
holes/cell, respectively. The corresponding electron (or
hole) carrier density is about 4.21 × 1021/cm3. The den-
sity of states at the Fermi energy is 3.95 state per eV per
formula unit, and the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ

= 9.31 mJ/(K2·mol) and Pauli paramagnetic susceptibil-
ity χp = 1.60 × 10−9m3/mol. And the plasma frequency
fp is computed as about 20883 cm−1. These calculated
quantities are summarized in Table 1. The total and Fe-
3d orbital projected density of states of CaFe2As2 are
almost the same as the ones for SrFe2As2.
3.2
Antiferromagnetic Neel state
To study the electronic structures of AFe2As2 in a mag-
netic state, we break the spin up-down symmetry by as-
signing a ﬁnite magnetic moment to each Fe atom. The
ferromagnetic state is found to be not stable in AFe2As2,
similar as in LaFeAsO [22].
However, the antiferro-
magnetic Neel state is meta-stable. Its energy is lower
than the corresponding nonmagnetic state by 0.232 eV,
0.175 eV, and 0.133 eV per formula unit for BaFe2As2,
SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2, respectively.
The magnetic
moments in BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2 are
found to be respectively 2.3 μB/Fe, 2.2 μB/Fe, and 2.0
μB/Fe, similar as the one for LaFeAsO [22], while a mo-
ment of about 1.7 μB/Fe was found for all these three
systems in the full potential local-density approximation
calculations [29]. The density of states for the antiferro-
magnetic Neel state of BaFe2As2 is shown in Figs. 2(b)
and 3(b). The corresponding electronic band structure
with the Fermi surface shapes is shown in Fig. 7. The
electronic structures and the Fermi surface topology are
similar for the other two ternary iron arsenides in the
antiferromagnetic Neel state.

tional views through symmetrical k-point Z (c) and Γ (d) parallel

As shown in Fig. 2(b), the density of states around
there is substantially reduced around −0.5 eV in compar-
ison with that in the nonmagnetic state [Fig. 2(a)]. The
missing states are pushed down to around −2.0 eV. This
change can be also seen by comparing the electronic band
structures of the nonmagnetic and the square antiferro-
magnetic Neel states, shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 7(a).
In contrast to the nonmagnetic state, there are only two
bands crossing the Fermi energy, forming a ring-like hole-
type shape around Z, a cylinder-like electron-type sheet
centered around X–P, and a small-pocket-like electron-
type sheet around Z.
3.3
Collinear antiferromagnetic state
For BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2, the antiferro-
magnetic Neel state is a meta-stable state among the
rich magnetic structures. It is found that the true ground
state is in fact a collinear antiferromagnetic state with
the interlayer Fe moments in antiferromagnetic align-
ment. The spin conﬁguration of this state in FeAs layer
is schematically shown in Fig. 1(c).
3.3.1
BaFe2As2
For BaFe2As2, the energy of the collinear antiferromag-
netic state is lowered by 0.400 eV per formula unit than
that of the nonmagnetic state. The magnetic moment is
found to be about 2.65μB for each Fe ion in this state.
The electronic band structure and the density of states
are shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 2(c), respectively. In
contrast to the nonmagnetic state, the density of states
of As 4p orbitals in the low energy range from −2 eV to
0 eV is substantially enhanced in the collinear antiferro-
magnetic state.
Figure

shows
the

surface
shapes
of
BaFe2As2 in the collinear antiferromagnetic state. There
are two bands crossing the Fermi level. They lead to a
hole-type Fermi surface and an electron-type Fermi sur-
face, respectively. Here, we remind that if we consider
BaFe2As2 by a tetragonal unit cell, the axis MA in the
Brillouin zone of the tetragonal unit cell is now folded
into the ΓZ, in which M point coincides with Γ point.
This means that the electron-type Fermi sheet around M
point in the tetragonal unit cell in the nonmagnetic state
will be gapped when the collinear antiferromagnetic or-
der takes place. From the volumes enclosed by these two

zone; (c) Fermi surface.Feng-jie MA, Zhong-yi LU, and Tao XIANG, Front. Phys. China, 2010, 5(2)
155
Fermi sheets, we ﬁnd that the electron carrier concen-
tration is 0.042 electrons/cell, namely 2.05 × 1020/cm3.
The corresponding hole carrier concentration is 0.021
holes/cell, namely 1.03 × 1020/cm3. Thus the electron
concentration dominates over the hole concentration, un-
like in the nonmagnetic state. By using the second-order
polynomial to ﬁt the calculated band structures, we esti-
mate the electron eﬀective masses as m∗
e = 0.31me with
me being electron mass. We then calculate the plasma
frequency as fp = 7717 cm−1. Here the contribution of
the holes to the plasma frequency is negligible. These
values are also listed in Table 1 in comparison with the
available experimental values.
In comparison with the nonmagnetic state, the elec-
tron eﬀective mass becomes much lighter. Meanwhile,
the carrier density is reduced by an order of magni-
tude, as shown in Table 1.
This reduction is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than that in LaFeAsO. In LaFeAsO, the
carrier density is reduced by two orders of magnitude
in the collinear antiferromagnetic state than in the non-
magnetic state [19]. The density of states at the Fermi
energy EF is 2.41 state per eV per formula unit cell.
From this, we ﬁnd that the electronic speciﬁc heat coef-
ﬁcient γ = 5.68 mJ/(K2 · mol). It should be emphasized
that the calculated value of γ in the collinear antiferro-
magnetic state should be smaller than the intrinsic value
of γ at zero temperature measured by experiments since
the low energy quantum spin ﬂuctuations are suppressed
in the calculations, as discussed in Section 4. Therefore,
the measured γ in the low temperature limit should be
bound between the two calculated γ values obtained by
our calculations for the nonmagnetic and collinear anti-
ferromagntic states, respectively. In Table 1, we compare
the calculated speciﬁc heat coeﬃcients γ with the corre-
sponding experimental values. For BaFe2As2, there is
a large variety in the measurement values. Experimen-
tally, the ﬁrst reported measurement value of γ is about
37 mJ/(K2 · mol) [28], much larger than our DFT result.
However, with the sample quality being improved, the
second reported value of γ becomes 16 mJ/(K2 ·mol) [9];
and the latest reported value of γ is 6.1 mJ/(K2 · mol)
[23], which is in fact good consistent with our DFT cal-
culation.
For SrFe2As2 and CaFe2As2, our calculated
results are also consistent with the measurement values.
In the collinear antiferromagnetic state, there is fur-
ther a small energy gain if the Fe-Fe distance is reduced
along the spin parallel alignment direction and expanded
along the spin anti-parallel alignment direction.
This
leads to a structural transition from tetragonal space
group I4/mmm to orthorhombic space group Fmmm,
similar to that in LaFeAsO [19] and observed by the
neutron scattering [10]. This lattice relaxation is ener-
getically favorable because the direct ferromagnetic ex-
change favors a shorter Fe–Fe separation while the an-
tiferromagnetic superexchange favors a larger Fe–As–Fe
angle. It turns out that the angle γ in ab-plane is no
longer rectangular [Fig. 1(c)] and the energy gain is 3
meV per formula unit, when γ is about 90.8◦, similar as
in LaFeAsO [19]. The correction from this lattice dis-
tortion to the electronic band structure as well as the Fe
moments is very small.
Along the c-axis, we ﬁnd that the Fe-spins between
the nearest neighbor FeAs layers interact antiferromag-
netically and the energy gain by taking the anti-parallel
alignment is about 0.012 eV per formula unit cell in com-
parison with the parallel alignment. This antiferromag-
netic interaction between the nearest neighboring FeAs
layers is signiﬁcantly larger than that in LaFeAsO [19].
In Ref. [1], we reported the electronic band structure
and the Fermi surface of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Sr, Ca) in the
collinear antiferromagnetic order with the parallel align-
ment along the c-axis.
3.3.2
SrFe2As2
For SrFe2As2, the energy of the collinear antiferromag-
netic state is lowered by 0.383 eV per formula unit than
the one of the nonmagnetic state. The magnetic moment
is about 2.55μB per Fe atom. The electronic band struc-
ture and the Fermi surface are shown in Fig. 9. From
the volumes enclosed by the Fermi surface sheets, we
ﬁnd that the electron and hole carrier concentrations are
about 0.008 electrons/cell and 0.025 holes/cell, namely
about 0.44 × 1020/cm3 and 1.31 × 1020/cm3, respec-
tively. It turns out that the hole concentration domi-
nates over the electron concentration, unlike the case of
BaFe2As2. And the plasma frequency fp is computed
as about 4249 cm−1. In comparison with the nonmag-
netic state, the carrier density is much reduced, by more

CaFe2As2
For CaFe2As2, the collinear antiferromagnetic ordering
can lower the ground state energy by 0.352 eV per for-
mula unit in comparison with the nonmagnetic state.
There are about 2.49μB moment around each Fe atom.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface are
shown in Fig.
10.
The electron (hole) carrier den-
sity is about 0.016 electrons/cell (0.016 holes/cell), or
0.90 × 1020/cm3 (0.90 × 1020/cm3).
Thus, the elec-
tron concentration and the hole concentration are in bal-
ance, diﬀerent from the ones in BaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2.
And the plasma frequency fp is computed as about
5557 cm−1. Similar to SrFe2As2, the carrier density is
also much reduced by more than an order of magnitude
in comparison with the nonmagnetic state. The density
of states at the Fermi energy EF is about 1.11 state per
eV per formula unit cell and the electronic speciﬁc heat
coeﬃcient γ = 2.62 mJ/(K2 · mol).
These calculated
quantities are also reported in Table 1.

Spin-orbit interaction
The spin-orbit interaction results from the relativistic
eﬀect. It is known that this interaction leads to many
interesting features in transition metal oxides. To study
how strong this interaction can aﬀect the electronic prop-
erties of these materials, we performed a relativistic cal-
culation for BaFe2As2. Figure 11 shows the electronic
band structures of BaFe2As2 by including spin-orbit in-
teraction in the nonmagnetic state. By comparison with
Figs. 4(a) and 8(a), we ﬁnd that the spin-orbit interac-
tion splits the band mainly along Γ–Z into two bands
by about 50–150 meV around the Fermi energy.
3.5
Pressure eﬀect
Experimentally it was reported [11–13] that the ternary
iron arsenides AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) can become
superconducting under high pressures without doping.
This provides another route to study the salient fea-
tures of these materials in connection with the intrinsic
electronic structures and properties. The superconduct-
ing phase appears when the pressure is in the ranges of
2.5–8, 28–37, and 22–58 kbar for CaFe2As2, SrFe2As2,
and BaFe2As2 respectively. The highest superconduct-
ing transition temperatures for these three compounds
are 12 K, 27 K, and 29 K, respectively.
Fig. 11
Electronic band structures of BaFe2As2 including spin-
orbit interaction in the nonmagnetic state.
Figure 12(a) shows the pressure dependence of relative
energies for the nonmagnetic, square antiferromagnetic
Neel and collinear antiferromagnetic states of BaFe2As2,
respectively. The collinear antiferromagnetic state is ro-
bust against the pressure and has the lowest energy in
the pressure range studied, consistent with the result re-
ported in Ref. [31]. Note that in this calculation, the
lattice parameters are relaxed when the pressure is zero.
Thus, the energy diﬀerences are slightly diﬀerent from
that given before.

Note the energy of the non-
magnetic state without pressure is set to zero. (b) The magnetic
moments for the collinear antiferromagnetic state (Collinear) and

The lattice structure of FeAs layers, including the an-
gle between Fe and As atoms and the bond lengths of Fe–
Fe, Fe–As, and As–As, is hardly changed by the pressure
from 0 to 80 kbar. However, the contraction along the c
axis is much more pronounced, especially in the nonmag-
netic state. This indicates that the distance between theFeng-jie MA, Zhong-yi LU, and Tao XIANG, Front. Phys. China, 2010, 5(2)
157
neighboring FeAs and Ba layers is substantially reduced
by pressure. This can strengthen the coupling between
the neighboring FeAs layers and stabilize the long range
antiferromagnetic correlation in the FeAs layer.
The magnetic moment in the magnetic states decreases
almost linearly with pressure, as shown in Fig. 12(b). In
our calculations, the magnetic moment is always larger
than 2μB in the collinear antiferromagntic state.
The
superexchange interaction thus remains dominant when
a pressure is imposed.

Eﬀective model
4.1
Local moment versus itinerant electrons
Physically the moments of Fe ions result from the on-site
Coulomb repulsion and the Hund’s rule coupling of 3d
orbitals. An isolated Fe ion in a 2+ valency has a spin
S = 2 with a large magnetic moment of 4μB. In iron-
pnictide semimetals, the eﬀective moment of a Fe ion (in
a 2+ valency) will be reduced by its hybridization with
other atoms and by the Coulomb screening of itinerant
electrons. However, it will remain ﬁnite if the Hund’s
rule coupling and the on-site Coulomb repulsion is strong
enough in comparison with the hybridization and other
screening eﬀects, as we found in LaFeAsO [19].
In our calculations, by projecting the density of states
onto the ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe in the collinear antifer-
romagnetic state of BaFe2As2 [Fig. 3(c)], we ﬁnd that
the ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe are almost completely ﬁlled by
up-spin electrons and nearly half-ﬁlled by down-spin elec-
trons in one of the two sublattices (or completely ﬁlled by
down-spin electrons and half-ﬁlled by up-spin electrons
in the other sublattice). This indicates that the crystal
ﬁeld splitting imposed by As atoms is very small and the
Fe 3d-orbitals hybridize strongly with each other. We
can see that this is a universal feature for all iron pnic-
tides, as we ﬁrst found in LaFeAsO [19].
The strong
polarization of Fe magnetic moments is thus due to the
Hund’s rule coupling.
In low temperatures, the Fe moments will interact with
each other to form an antiferromagnetic ordered state.
These ordered magnetic moments have been observed by
elastic neutron scattering and other experiments [7, 10].
However, they are not exactly the moments obtained by
the DFT calculations, as we indicated ﬁrst for LaFeAsO
[19]. This is because the DFT calculation is done based
on a small magnetic unit cell and the low-energy quan-
tum spin ﬂuctuations as well as their interactions with
itinerant electrons are frozen by the ﬁnite excitation gap
due to the ﬁnite-size eﬀect. Thus, the moment obtained
by the DFT is the bare moment of each Fe ion. It should
be larger than the ordering moment measured by neutron
scattering and other experiments. Our calculations show
that the bare magnetic moment around each Fe atom is
about 2.2–2.6 μB in all iron pnictides and in diﬀerent
magnetically ordered states.
In high temperatures, there is no net static moment in
the paramagnetic phase due to the thermal ﬂuctuation,
but the bare moment of each Fe ion can still be measured
by a fast local probe like ESR (electron spin resonance).
Very recently, the bare moment of Fe has been observed
in the paramagnetic phase by the ESR measurement [40].
The value of the moment detected by ESR is about 2.2–
2.8 μB in good agreement with our DFT result, which is
but signiﬁcantly larger than the ordering moment in the
antiferromagnetic phase.
Again similar to what we found in LaFeAsO [19], from
the spatial distributions of electrons, we further ﬁnd that
there is a strong hybridization between neighboring Fe
and As ions.
This strong hybridization can mediate
an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between
the Fe moments. This superexchange interaction is an-
tiferromagnetic since the intermediate state associated
with the hopping bridged by As ions is a spin singlet.
On the other hand, there is a relatively small but ﬁnite
hybridization between two neighboring Fe ions.
This
direct hybridization of Fe 3d orbitals can induce a di-
rect exchange interaction between the Fe moments. This
direct exchange interaction is ferromagnetic due to the
Hund’s rule coupling. Furthermore, there is a strong co-
valent bonding or hybridization between As 4p orbitals
although the separation between As atoms is relatively
large.
This hybridization gives rise to a broad As 4p
band below the Fermi level. Thus, As 4p states are not
truly localized. They form an electron network connect-
ing As ions through covalent bonding, similar to what
we found in iron chalcogenides (α-FeSe and α-FeTe) [32].
However, there is the diﬀerence that the band formed by
As 4p-orbitals is insulating, as shown in Fig. 2, while
the band formed by Te 5p orbitals is metallic (see Ref.
[32]). It turns out that the exchange interaction bridged
by As 4p orbitals is short ranged (just J1 and J2) while
the one bridged by Te 5p orbitals can be long ranged,
as we found in α-FeTe in which there is a substantial
third nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange
interaction J3 besides J1 and J2 [32].
4.2
t–JH–J1–J2 Hamiltonian
For iron-based pnictides, the low energy spin dynamics
could be approximately described by an antiferromag-
netic Heisenberg model with the nearest and the next-
nearest neighbor exchange interactions. However, the Fe
spin (or magnetic moment) is not quantized since the
electrons constituting the moment can propagate on the
lattice, like in hole or electron doped high Tc supercon-
ductivity cuprates. Besides these superexchange interac-
tions, the on-site Hund’s rule coupling among diﬀerent158
Feng-jie MA, Zhong-yi LU, and Tao XIANG, Front. Phys. China, 2010, 5(2)
Fe 3d orbitals is important. This is because the crystal
splitting of Fe 3d levels is very small and the spins of
Fe 3d electrons are polarized mainly by this interaction.
Thus, we believe that the low-energy physical proper-
ties of these iron-based pnictides can be approximately
described by the following eﬀective Hamiltonian

is the spin operator of the α orbital at site i. The total
spin operator at site i is deﬁned by Si = 
α Siα. In Eq.
(2), JH is the on-site Hund’s coupling among the ﬁve Fe
3d orbitals. The value of JH is generally believed to be
about 1 eV. tαβ
ij
are the eﬀective hopping integrals that
can be determined from the electronic band structure in
the nonmagnetic state [33].
The nearest and the next-nearest neighbor antiferro-
magnetic coupling constants, J1 and J2, in Eq. (2) can
be calculated from the relative energies of the ferromag-
netic, square antiferromagnetic, and collinear antiferro-
magnetic states with respect to the non-magnetic state.
For the corresponding detailed calculations, please refer
to the appendix in our paper in Ref. [19]. For BaFe2As2,
the energy of the ferromagnetic state is about 8meV per
Fe lower than the nonmagnetic state and the Fe moment
is about 2.3μB. From this and the relative energies of the
two antiferromagnetic states, we ﬁnd that the exchange
constants are approximately given by J1= 25.5 meV/S2
per Fe and J2 = 33.8 meV/S2 per Fe (S is the spin of the
Fe ion) for BaFe2As2. Meanwhile, we also ﬁnd that the
interlayer superexchange antiferromagnetic coupling Jz
=3.1 meV/S2 per Fe. In obtaining these values, we have
assumed that the contribution of itinerant electrons to
the energy is almost unchanged in diﬀerent magnetically
ordered states. Since the bare tαβ
ij and JH can be consid-
ered independent of magnetic structures, the relative en-
ergies between diﬀerent magnetic states are not aﬀected
by itinerant electrons. For SrFe2As2 and CaFe2As2, the
values of J1 and J2 with Jz are determined as well and
given in Table 1. As we notice, J1 in CaFe2As2 is nega-
tive, namely ferromagnetic, which is unique among iron
pnictides.
4.3
Discussion
We plot the superconducting critical temperatures Tc
versus J2 for these compounds with doping carriers or
by applying high pressures in Fig. 13. Interesting, as we
see, the maximum critical temperatures Tc are in pro-
portion to the next-nearest neighbor superexchange in-
teraction J2.
This suggests that there would exist an
intrinsic relationship between the superconductivity and
the As-bridged superexchange antiferromagnetic inter-
actions.
Here we have assumed that the value of J2
does not change with doping or pressure in compari-
son with the ones of the parent compounds. This can
be veriﬁed from Fig. 14. Figure 14 shows how the su-
perexchange interactions J1 and J2 change with the pres-
sure, from which we ﬁnd that J2 slightly changes with
the pressure. However, J1 drops quickly with increasing
pressure. This is because the energy diﬀerence between
the non-magnetic state and the square antiferromagnetic
Neel state can be signiﬁcantly reduced by the pressure,
as shown in Fig. 12.

thus play a dominant role.
In Eq. (2), if the J1 and
J2 terms are ignored, the Hamiltonian will look simi-
lar to the double exchange model that was proposed for
describing the physical properties of colossal magneto-
resistance (CMR) of manganese oxides [36, 37]. How-
ever, there is an essential diﬀerence. In manganese ox-
ides the crystal ﬁeld splitting between eg and t2g orbitals
is very large, the moments polarized by the Hund’s rule
coupling on the t2g orbitals are completely localized and
only eg electrons can hop on the lattice. In contrast, in
iron pnictides, all ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe have contribu-
tions to the moment and at the same time they can also
hop on the lattice. Nevertheless, we believe that their
charge dynamics share a common feature. In manganese
oxides there is a strong spin-dependent scattering on the
conduction electrons due to the strong Hund’s coupling
between eg and t2g levels of Mn ions. If the localized core
spins of Mn are aligned ferromagnetically, the scattering
of the electrons due to the core spins will be dramati-
cally reduced because of no spin-ﬂip, leading to a giant
magneto-resistance and a sharp drop of resistivity with
decreasing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase. In
iron pnictides, there is also a strong spin-dependent scat-
tering on conduction electrons caused by the Hund’s rule
coupling. In low temperatures, the moments of Fe ions
are in the collinear antiferromagnetic order, in which the
Fe moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along one
direction but ferromagnetically along the other direction
perpendicular. Similar as in manganese oxides, the scat-
tering of electrons along the ferromagnetic direction is
signiﬁcantly reduced, leading to a sharp drop of resistiv-
ity and a large magneto-resistivity in the collinear an-
tiferromagnetic phase, in agreement with experimental
measurements [25, 38].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have reported calculated results on
the electronic band structures of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca,
or Sr) by using the ﬁrst-principles electronic structure
calculations. The ground state of AFe2As2 is shown to
be a collinear antiferromagnetic semimetal with a large
magnetic moment around each Fe ion. The electronic
structure is weakly aﬀected by the spin-orbit interaction,
but strongly altered by pressure. We have determined
the density of states at the Fermi level, the speciﬁc heat
coeﬃcient and the Pauli susceptibility in both the non-
magnetic and collinear antiferromagnetic states.
The
eﬀective antiferromagnetic coupling constants of the Fe
moments are also estimated assuming that the low-
energy spin dynamics is approximately described by the
Heisenberg model with the nearest and the next-nearest
neighboring exchange terms. Based on the analysis of
electronic and magnetic structures, we proposed that
the low-energy physics of AFe2As2 can be eﬀectively de-
scribed by the t–JH–J1–J2 model, deﬁned by Eq. (2).
