A notable phenomenon in topological semimetals is the violation of Kohler’s rule, which dictates that the
magnetoresistance MR obeys a scaling behavior of MR ¼ fðH=ρ0Þ, where MR ¼ ½ρðHÞ −ρ0=ρ0 and H is
the magnetic field, with ρðHÞ and ρ0 being the resistivity at H and zero field, respectively. Here, we report a
violation originating from thermally induced change in the carrier density. We find that the magnetoresistance
of the Weyl semimetal TaP follows an extended Kohler’s rule MR ¼ f½H=ðnTρ0Þ, with nT describing the
temperature dependence of the carrier density. We show that nT is associated with the Fermi level and the
dispersion relation of the semimetal, providing a new way to reveal information on the electronic band
structure. We offer a fundamental understanding of the violation and validity of Kohler’s rule in terms of
different temperature responses of nT. We apply our extended Kohler’s rule to BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2 to settle a
long-standing debate on the scaling behavior of the normal-state magnetoresistance of a superconductor,
namely, MR ∼tan2θH, where θH is the Hall angle. We further validate the extended Kohler’s rule and
demonstrate its generality in a semiconductor, InSb, where the temperature-dependent carrier density can be
reliably determined both theoretically and experimentally.

I. INTRODUCTION
The magnetic-field-induced resistance change is conven-
tionally termed as magnetoresistance (MR) [1]. In 1938,
Kohler [2] developed a rule to account for the magneto-
resistances in metals. Kohler’s rule states that the magneto-
resistance MR should be a function of the ratio H=ρ0 of the
magnetic field H to the zero-field resistivity ρ0. That is, the
field dependence of the magnetoresistances should exhibit a
scaling behavior of MR ¼ fðH=ρ0Þ, where MR ¼ ½ρðHÞ −
ρ0=ρ0 with ρðHÞ and ρ0 being the resistivity at H and zero
field at a fixed temperature, respectively. Kohler’s rule of the
magnetoresistances has been observed in materials [3–15]
beyond metals and, recently, has been extensively used to
understand novel magnetoresistance behavior such as the
“turn-on” temperature behavior of the magnetoresistance in
topological materials [5–15]. Violations of Kohler’s rule have
been often reported [16–40] and used as evidence for phase
transitions [16,17] or for emergent new physics [18–22].
Here, we explore Kohler’s rule of magnetoresistances in Weyl
semimetals, where both its validity [5,6,8] and violation
[23–25,27,28] are reported, with the aim to uncover the role
played by the inevitable thermally induced change in the
density of carriers on the scaling behavior. We find that the
magnetoresistance of the Weyl semimetal tantalum phos-
phide (TaP) follows an extended Kohler’s rule MR ¼
f½H=ðnTρ0Þ, where nT describes the relative change induced
by thermal excitation in the carrier density, with nT ¼ 1

Published by the American Physical Societydenoting the original Kohler’s rule. We outline an innovative
approach to obtain nT without knowing the values of the
carrier density, providing a new way to probe the temperature
dependence of the carrier density. We show that nT is
associated with the Fermi level and the dispersion relation,
thereby revealing information on the electronic band struc-
ture. We offer a fundamental description of the violation and
validity of Kohler’s rule in terms of different temperature
responses of nT. In particular, Kohler’s rule is expected to be
violated in materials with low carrier density where a
noticeable density change due to thermal excitation occurs,
while Kohler’s rule should hold in materials where the carrier
density is high enough such that its thermally induced change
is experimentally indiscernible. Furthermore, by investigating
the scaling behavior of the normal-state magnetoresistance in
superconducting BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2 crystals, we demonstrate
that our extended Kohler’s rule can account for the scaling
MR ∼tan2θH where θH is the Hall angle, which was first
observed in cuprate superconductors YBa2Cu3O7−δ and
La2SrxCuO4 [18] and has led to a long-standing debate in
describing the normal-state magnetoresistance of a super-
conductor [19–21,33–41]. We also demonstrate the general-
ity of our extended Kohler’s rule in an undoped narrow-gap
semiconductor, indium antimonide (InSb). At high temper-
atures, InSb is a compensated two-band system with high-
mobility electrons and low-mobility holes, enabling us to
determine the carrier density via Hall measurements and use
its temperature dependence to test the validity of the nT term
in our extended Kohler’s rule.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data reported here are obtained from two TaP crystals
(sample TP1 and sample TP2), two BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2
crystals with x ¼ 0.25 (sample PL) and x ¼ 0.5 (sample
PH), and one undoped InSb crystal (sample IS).
A. Preparation of samples
1. TaP
Centimeter-sized single crystals of TaP are grown using
the vapor transport method in two steps. In the first step, 3 g
of Ta (Beantown Chemical, 99.95%) and P (Beantown
Chemical, 99.999%) powders are weighed, mixed, and
ground in a glovebox. The mixed powders are sealed in
an evacuated quartz tube which is subsequently heated to
700 °C and sintered for 20 h for a prereaction. In the second
step, the obtained TaP powder along with 0.4 g of I2 (Sigma
Aldrich, ≥99.8%) are sealed in a new evacuated quartz tube
and are subsequently placed in a two-zone furnace with zone
temperatures of 900 °C and 950 °C, respectively. The crystal
growth time is 14 days. Because of the very high electrical
conductivity of TaP, it is difficult to carry out high-precision
electrical measurements on the as-grown crystals. To
increase the electrical resistance of the samples, we polish
the crystals down to a thin slab along the c axis (thickness of
tens of micrometers). Electrical leads are gold wires glued to
the crystals using silver epoxy H20E.
2. BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2
Crystals of BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2 with doping levels of x ¼
0.25 and x ¼ 0.50 are grown using the self-flux method
[42]. High-purity flakes of Ba (99.99%, Aldrich) and
powders of FeAs and FeP (homemade from Fe, As, and
P, 99.99%, Aldrich) are thoroughly mixed and placed in an
Al2O3 crucible, which is then sealed in an evacuated quartz
tube under vacuum and placed in a Lindberg box furnace.
Crystals of plate shapes with lateral dimensions up to 2 mm
and thicknesses up to 200 μm are obtained by heating up to
1180 °C and then cooling down to 900 °C at a rate of
2 °C= min. Electrical leads of gold wires with a diameter of
50 μm are attached to the crystals using silver epoxy H20E.
3. InSb
A crystal of 5 mm × 5 mm × 0.5 mm is purchased from
the MTI corporation. It is subsequently cut into pieces with
desired lateral dimensions. Gold pads approximately
100 nm thick are deposited on locations predefined using
photolithography. Electrical leads are fabricated by attach-
ing 50-μm-diameter gold wires to the pads with silver
epoxy H20E.
B. Resistance measurements
We conduct resistance measurements to obtain both
RxxðHÞ and RxyðHÞ curves at various fixed temperatures,
enabling the calculation of the resistivities ρxxðHÞ ¼
Rxxwd=l and ρxyðHÞ ¼ Rxyd, where w, d, and l are the
width, thickness of the sample, and the separation between
the voltage contacts, respectively. The magnetic field is
applied along the c axis of the crystals. The magnetoresist-
ance is defined as MR ¼ ½ρxxðHÞ −ρ0Þ=ρ0, where ρxxðHÞ
and ρ0 are the resistivities at a fixed temperature with and
without the presence of a magnetic field, respectively. In
some cases, we obtain ρxxðTÞ curves from the measured
ρxxðHÞ curves at fixed temperatures to avoid nonequilibrium
temperature effects. Data for TaP and InSb are obtained
using the conventional four-probe dc electrical transport
measurement technique, while those for BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2
are obtained using a low-frequency lock-in method.

TaP is a transition-metal monophosphide considered
as the first realization of a Weyl semimetal [43–46].

041029-2behavior [5,7,8] and topological insulating states [28–30],
we also present ρxxðTÞ curves in Fig. 1(b).
Both ρxxðHÞ and ρxxðTÞ in Fig. 1 are consistent with
those reported recently in other materials with extremely
large magnetoresistance [5–16,22–32]. The magnetoresist-
ance MR can be as high as 105% at 2 K and 9 T [Fig. 2(a)]
and follows the typical power law MR ∼Hm behavior with
m ≈1.6 [dashed line in Fig. 2(c)] [27]. In the absence of a
magnetic field, the resistivity decreases monotonically with
temperature, as expected for a semimetal. When an external
magnetic field is applied, the resistivity increases and a
remarkable turn-on behavior appears in the ρxxðTÞ curves:
The temperature behavior of the resistivity changes from
metal-like at high temperatures to insulatorlike at low
temperatures at magnetic fields H ¼ 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 T
and becomes insulatorlike over the entire temperature range
at higher magnetic fields.
The key results of this work on TaP are displayed in
Fig. 2, which presents the violation of Kohler’s rule and
highlights our extended Kohler’s rule. For clarity, we
present in Fig. 2(a) partial MRðHÞ curves derived from
the ρxxðHÞ data in Fig. 1(a), while all ρxxðTÞ curves in
Fig. 1(b) are used to obtain the MRðTÞ curves in Fig. 2(d).
The respective scaling of MRðHÞ and MRðTÞ is presented
in Figs. 2(b) and 2(e). Clearly, Kohler’s rule MR ¼
fðH=ρ0Þ is not followed in TaP, since the MR curves do
not collapse onto a single curve when plotted against H=ρ0.
However, all curves in Fig. 2(b) are nearly in parallel with
each other, suggesting that a single temperature-dependent
multiplier to MR (y axis) or to H=ρ0 (x axis) could cause
them to overlap or collapse onto the same curve. Here, we
tackle the latter case and uncover the underlying physics.
For the convenience of the forthcoming discussions, we
designate 1=nT as the temperature-dependent multiplier to
H=ρ0 (x axis) in the MR ∼H=ρ0 curves in Fig. 2(b). In
practice, we scale all the MR curves to the T ¼ 300 K
curve [i.e., nT ¼ 1 for MRð300 KÞ ∼ð1=nTÞðH=ρ0Þ] by
varying nT for each curve. As shown in Fig. 2(c), all curves
in Fig. 2(b) indeed collapse onto the T ¼ 300 K curve
when the data are scaled as MR ∼H=ðnTρ0Þ. The nT values
for the MR ∼H=ρ0 curves at various temperatures are
presented in Fig. 3. It decreases monotonically from nT ¼ 1
at T ¼ 300 K to nT ¼ 0.45 at T ¼ 2 K. As presented in
Fig. 2(f), we also account for the violation of Kohler’s rule
in Fig. 2(e) for the MRðTÞ curves by using the same nT
values as those used in Fig. 2(c). We find nearly identical
behavior for the second TaP crystal (sample TP2), as
demonstrated by the plots of MR ∼H=ðnTρ0Þ in Fig. S1
[47], with nT presented in Fig. 3. That is, the magneto-
resistance of TaP follows an extended Kohler’s rule with a
thermal factor nT:
MR ¼ f½H=ðnTρ0Þ:
ð1Þ
In the analysis above, we purposely use nT in the
denominator to couple with ρ0 in Eq. (1), aiming to reveal
the possible role of the carrier density in the violation of
Kohler’s rule. In a theoretical consideration on the violation
of Kohler’s rule in the normal-state resistivity of cuprate
superconductors, Luo and Miley [41] introduce a MR
scaling form (it is called a modified Kohler’s rule)
MR ¼ fðHτÞ, where τ is the relaxation time of the carriers,
since H and τ are coupled together as Hτ for MRs in the
derived equations [41]. Using ρ0 ¼ m=ðne2τÞ, Hτ can be
expressed as Hτ ¼ ðm=e2ÞH=ðnρ0Þ, indicating that a
scaling behavior of MR ¼ f½H=ðnρ0Þ is expected if m
is temperature independent. However, there is no reliable
way to obtain the values of n in a semimetal from transport
measurements, as demonstrated in Fig. S2 [47] for nH=n in
a compensated system with ne ¼ nh ¼ n, where nH is the
density obtained from Hall effect measurements and in
Fig. S3 [47] for electron and hole density derived from a
two-band model analysis in TaP. Furthermore, m can
change with temperature [48]. More importantly, materials
such as multiband semimetals, where violation of Kohler’s

EXTENDED KOHLER’S RULE OF MAGNETORESISTANCE

041029-3rule is reported, go beyond the (isotropic) single-band
consideration in MR ¼ fðHτÞ. We reveal in the discussion
below that H and the mobility μi ¼ eτ=m
i (i ≥1) are
interconnected as Hμi in the MR expression. Also, it is the
temperature-induced change in the carrier density that is
responsible for the violation of Kohler’s rule. Hence, our
extended Kohler’s rule expression in Eq. (1) provides a
unique way to reveal the temperature dependence of the
carrier density.
In the normal state of a cuprate superconductor, the
temperature-induced change in the carrier density can be
attributed to the existence of a pseudogap or Mott-Wannier
excitons of weakly bound electrons and holes [41].
Differing from the linear temperature dependence of the
carrier density used to explain the violation of Kohler’s rule
in cuprate superconductors [41], the nT obtained in our
samples can be approximately described by nT ∼T2
(Fig. S4 [47]), which can be attributed to the thermally
induced change in the carrier density, as elaborated below.
As revealed by band structure calculations and angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experi-
ments [43–46], TaP has a total of 12 pairs of Weyl nodes.
Four of them, denoted as W1, are enclosed by an electron-
like Fermi surface with energies below the Fermi level. The
other eight pairs, denoted as W2, are enclosed by a holelike
Fermi surface and with energies above the Fermi level. The
band structure is illustrated in Fig. 3, with the relative
locations of W1 and W2 with respect to the Fermi level, EF.
Considering the temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac dis-
tribution, the total density of the conduction electrons at a
given T can be straightforwardly obtained using
n ¼

ð2Þ
where i ¼ 1 and 2 correspond to Weyl nodes W1 and W2,
respectively, with respective energies of Ei ¼ E1 and E2.
gi ¼ g1ðεÞ and g2ðεÞ are the density of states (DOS) for the
conduction bands of W1 and W2, respectively. Since equal
numbers of holes are created, Eq. (2) can also be used to
calculate the thermally induced change in the hole density.
In TaP, the densities of electron and holes are close to each
other (Fig. S3c [47]). We focus only on electron density in
the following discussions.
The energies E1 and E2 of the Weyl nodes W1 and W2 in
TaP are determined by band structure calculations [44] and
by ARPES measurements [45]. The theoretical DOS
roughly follows g ∼ε at ε up to approximately 0.3 eV

041029-4and becomes nearly constant at higher energies [44,48]. As
an estimate, we use gi ¼ gi0ðε −EiÞ for ε ≤0.3 eV and
gi ¼ gi0ð0.3 −EiÞ for higher energies. In Fig. S5(a) [47],
we present the calculated n1 and n2 and their sum n using
the theoretical values of (−53.1 meV, 19.6 meV) for the
energies (E1, E2) (relative to the Fermi level) of the Weyl
nodes W1 and W2 and the electron and hole densities of
ne0 ¼ 4.898 × 1024 m−3 and nh0 ¼ 5.317 × 1024 m−3 at
T ¼ 0 K [44]. As indicated by the dashed curve in
Fig. 3, the total electron density n, normalized to the value
at T ¼ 300 K, describes the experimental nT very well. The
small deviation can be understood with sample-dependent
(E1, E2), as demonstrated by the dotted curve obtained
using the experimental values [45] of (−40 meV, 24 meV)
and
the
solid
curve
calculated
with
(−46.2 meV,
19.6 meV), i.e., a slight increase in the theoretical E1
value toward the experimental one while keeping the value
of E2 unchanged.
The above discussion indicates that the relative position of
the Fermi level to the bottom of the conduction band and the
top of the valence band, i.e., the density of electrons and
holes at T ¼ 0 K, affects the temperature dependence of nT.
As presented in Fig. S5(b) [47], the temperature-induced
change in nT mostly comes from the electron band. In
Fig. S6(a) [47], we present nT versus T curves calculated
using different values of EF in the electron band. It is clear
that the sensitivity of nT to T depends strongly on the Fermi
level. In our TaP samples with EF ≈50 meV to the bottom
of the conduction band, nT nearly doubles when the
temperature is increased from T ¼ 2 to 300 K. However,
it becomes challenging to experimentally resolve the change
in nT in the same temperature range when the Fermi level is
increased to 200 meV. In this case, nT ≈1 and Kohler’s rule
should hold within experimental errors. Thus, the Fermi
energy, i.e., electron density at T ¼ 0 K, plays a key role in
Kohler’s rule. It directly explains why Kohler’s rule is
violated in type-I Weyl semimetals while it is upheld in
their type-II counterparts, since the latter typically have
much higher electron densities [5,6,8]. The validity of
Kohler’s rule in conventional metals is also not a surprise.
They have much higher Fermi energies of a few eVs and
electron densities of 1028−29 m−3 [49], which is 3–4 orders
of magnitude higher than that of TaP, making thermally
induced changes in the carrier density irrelevant. In Fig. S6
(b) [47], we show that the functional form of the DOS gðεÞ
can further contribute to the nT versus T relationship. When
the exponent α in gðεÞ ∼εα changes from α ¼ 1 for TaP to
α ¼ 1=2 for typical metals, nT becomes less sensitive to the
change of T at the same Fermi level. This explains why the
violation of Kohler’s rule is observed more often in
topological semimetals than in their trivial counterparts.
B. Extended Kohler’s rule versus other alternative
scaling forms of the magnetoresistance
In addition to topological materials, violations of
Kohler’s rule are often reported in cuprates and iron-based
superconductors as well as other topologically trivial
materials, and various alternative MR scaling forms have
been introduced [18–20,33–41]. Among them, the most
common one is
MR ¼ γHtan2 θH;
ð3Þ
where θH ¼ arctanðρxy=ρxxÞ is the Hall angle. This MR
scaling behavior was first reported in cuprate supercon-
ductors, with γH ¼ 1.7 and γH ¼ 1.5–1.7 for underdoped
and optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7−δ, respectively, and γH ¼
13.6 for La2SrxCuO4 [18]. It has numerous explanations
[18–21,37–41] including the spin-charge separation sce-
nario of the Luttinger liquid [21], current vertex correc-
tions, and spin density wave [20]. Below, we show that the
scaling Eq. (3) is a natural outcome of our extended
Kohler’s rule Eq. (1) in a compensated two-band material
when the carrier mobility is very low, with γH being an
indicator of the ratio of the hole and electron mobility. We
also obtain similar scaling forms to Eqs. (1) and (3) for a
low-mobility single-band system with an anisotropic Fermi

respectively. To show the temperature dependence rather than their
absolute values, all the calculated curves are normalized to the
values at T ¼ 300 K. Schematics of the electronic band structures
are presented on the top of the panel.
EXTENDED KOHLER’S RULE OF MAGNETORESISTANCE

041029-5surface as well as noncompensated two-band and multi-
band systems.
For a compensated two-band system where ne ¼
nh ¼ n, the second term in the denominator of Eq. (S1)
[47] is zero, leading to MR ¼ μeμhH2. Hence, MR can be
rewritten as MR ¼ αμ=e2½H=ðnρ0Þ2 where αμ ¼ ðμh=μeÞ=
ð1 þ μh=μeÞ2, ρ0 ¼ ½neðμh þ μeÞ−1, and ne, nh, μe, and μh
are the densities and mobilities of electron and holes,
respectively. Thus, our extended Kohler’s rule presented
in Eq. (1) is valid if αμ is temperature independent.
Likewise, the second term in the numerator of Eq. (S2)
[47] also becomes zero, yielding a linear Hall resistivity
ρxy¼Hðμh=μe−1Þ=½enðμh=μeþ1Þ. Then, MR ¼ μeμhH2
can be alternately expressed as
MR ¼ γHðρxy=ρ0Þ2
ð4Þ
with
γH ¼ ðμh=μeÞ=ð1 −μh=μeÞ2:
ð5Þ
At very low mobilities, MR →0 and ρxx ≈ρ0, resulting
in Eqs. (3) and (4) being equivalent. That is, in a
compensated two-band system with very low mobilities,
our extended Kohler’s rule in Eq. (1) leads to the scaling
behavior of Eq. (3).
The same conclusion can be reached for a nearly
compensated two-band system, if the mobilities and/or
the magnetic fields are low, such that the second term in the
denominator of both Eqs. (S1) and (S2) [47] as well as the
second term in the numerator of Eq. (S2) [47] become
negligible. As revealed in TaP below, αμ is indeed temper-
ature insensitive [Fig. 5(b)]. Thus, our extended Kohler’s
rule Eq. (1) can be expressed as Eq. (3) for a compensated
system as well as for a nearly compensated system with
very low mobilities and/or at very low fields if the
mobilities are high.
Underdoped YBa2Cu3O7−δ [50,51] are indeed two-
band materials. On the other hand, the optimal-doped
YBa2Cu3O7−δ (with Tc ¼ 90 K) which also shows the
scaling behavior akin to Eq. (3) is believed to be single-
band system with an anisotropic Fermi surface [41]. As
detailed in Supplemental Material [47], a single-band
material would have no magnetoresistance if all carriers
moving in the same direction have the same mobility. It
exhibits magnetoresistance probably due to (i) the mobil-
ity distribution of carriers from different energy levels
near the Fermi surface [1] and (ii) the existence of
impurities. In the first case, we can obtain MR ≈
αμ½H=ðnρ0Þ2
[Eq. (S10) [47]] with αμ ¼ 2κ=e2½1 þ
ðμL=μHÞ2=½1 þ μL=μH2 [Eq. (S11) [47]] at low carrier
mobilities such that μ2xH2 ≪1, where μH and μL represent
the highest and lowest mobility, respectively, of μx along
the x direction and κ is the ratio (μy=μx) of the carrier
mobilities μx and μy along the x and y directions. In the
meantime, we can also obtain MR ≈γ
Htan2θH with γ
H ¼
ð9=8κÞ½1 þ ðμL=μHÞ2½1 −ðμL=μHÞ22=½1 −ðμL=μHÞ32
[Eq. (S12) [47]. In the latter case, an optimal-doped
YBa2Cu3O7−δ crystal can be considered as a two-band
or multiband system, with a dominating intrinsic aniso-
tropic band together with one or more impurity bands. At
low
carrier
mobilities,
we

iðeniμiÞ, ni and μi being the carrier density and mobility
of the ith band. These results not only explain the
observed scaling behavior of Eq. (3) in optimal-doped
YBa2Cu3O7−δ, but
also indicate that our extended
Kohler’s rule Eq. (1) should be valid whenever the scaling
of Eq. (3) is observed.
TaP is a nearly compensated two-band system with high
mobilities, as manifested by the large MRs [Fig. 2(a)] and
nonlinear ρxy curves (Fig. S7 [47]). Thus, the scaling
behavior in Eq. (3) is expected to fail when the MRs
become significantly large, as confirmed by the plot in
Fig. 4(a), which shows that Eq. (3) is roughly valid for
MR < 10% and yields a value of γH ¼ 9 at T ¼ 300 K. On
the other hand, Eq. (4) is an approximate expression of
Eq. (1) at low magnetic fields and should be valid over a
wider field range by avoiding the influence of ρxxðHÞ in
Eq. (3). As plotted in Fig. 4(b), MR ∼ðρxy=ρ0Þ2 indeed
allows us to more reliably derive the γH values [Fig. 5(a)].
The corresponding μh=μe changes from 1.39 at T ¼ 300 K
to 1.24 at T ¼ 2 K [Fig. 5(b)], leading to a nearly
temperature-independent αμ with a very small change
(<0.35%) from T ¼ 300 K to T ¼ 2 K [Fig. 5(b)].
In both Kohler’s theory [2] and the derivations by Luo
and Miley [41], Hτ appears as a product that is inseparable
in the expression for MR ¼ fðHτÞ and, hence, has been
proposed as a modified Kohler’s rule [33,36,41]. The
magnetoresistances in the normal state of La2−xSrxCuO4
and KxFe2−ySe2 single crystals are indeed found to follow
the scaling behavior of MR ¼ fðHτÞ if τ ∼T−1 [33] and
τ ∼T−2 [36] are, respectively, assumed. However, τ is not a
parameter that can be conveniently obtained from resis-
tivity measurements. As discussed in Sec. III. A, MR ¼
fðHτÞ does not consider the possible role of the carrier’s
effective mass and τ should be replaced with μ, which can
have more than one value, as demonstrated in Eqs. (S10)
and (S11) as well as Eqs. (S15) and (S16) [47]. Thus, its
applications are limited, particularly for single-band sys-
tems with temperature-independent effective mass. It usu-
ally fails in two-band and multiband systems. For example,
by assuming single relaxation time τ for all carriers, we
can rewrite Eq. (S15) [47] as MR ¼ fðHτTτÞ with
τT ¼ P
iðni=m3
i Þ1=2= P
iðni=miÞ1=2, where ni and mi
are the carrier density and effective mass of the ith band,
respectively. Clearly, τT will not be a constant when ni and
mi are temperature dependent. That is, Eq. (1) extends the
Kohler’s rule to two-band and multiband systems, as
experimentally confirmed by the MR scaling behavior in
TaP. These derivations further indicate that nT represents
the temperature dependence of the carrier density in an
anisotropic single-band system [nT ∼n; see Eq. (S10) [47]]
as well as in two-band and multiband systems [nT ∼fnðTÞ;
see Eq. (S16) [47]] if the densities or mobilities from
different bands have the same or similar temperature
dependence, i.e., ni ≈n0
i fnðTÞ and μi ≈μ0
i fμðTÞ. In other
cases, the thermal factor nT in Eq. (1) contains contribu-
tions from the temperature dependences of the carrier
densities and mobilities of all bands.
C. Generality of the extended Kohler’s rule
1. Extended Kohler’s rule of normal-state
magnetoresistance in superconductor BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2
The discussions in the preceding section indicate that
Eq. (1), our extended Kohler’s rule, applied to a semimetal
also provides a sensible explanation for the alternative
scaling rule presented in Eq. (3), which is used routinely to
account for the normal-state magnetoresistances in several
classes of superconductors [19–21,33–41]. Here, we exper-
imentally confirm the applicability of Eq. (1) on two
superconducting BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2 crystals with x ¼ 0.25
and 0.5, respectively. Their corresponding superconducting
transition temperatures are 31 and 22 K, as revealed by the
temperature dependence of the zero-field resistivity pre-
sented in Fig. S8 [47].

EXTENDED KOHLER’S RULE OF MAGNETORESISTANCE
PHYS. REV. X 11, 041029 (2021)
041029-7In the overdoped crystal with x ¼ 0.5, we find that the
magnetoresistance obeys Kohler’s rule [Fig. S9(c) [47]],
while the plot of MR versus tan2θH does not collapse the
data into a single curve [Fig. S9(b)]. However, as indicated
by the dashed magenta line, the MR versus tan2θH curves
obtained at different temperature are indeed linear. The
parallel shift in the log-log plot indicates that the prefactor γH
in Eq. (3) is temperature dependent [inset in Fig. S9(b) [47]],
similar to that found in TaP [Fig. 5(a)]. In the underdoped
crystal with x ¼ 0.25, we do observe both the violation of
Kohler’s rule [Fig. 6(b)] and the validity of the scaling
Eq. (3) [Fig. 6(c)]. As indicated in Fig. 6(c) and the γH values
in its inset, MR versus tan2θH curves at T ≥50 K overlap
each other, while those at T < 45 K show a slight parallel
shift, with an increase of γH from approximately 7 at T ¼
45 K to approximately 9 at T ¼ 32 K. In contrast, our
extended Kohler’s rule [Eq. (1)] works well over the entire
temperature range as shown in Fig. 6(d). Similar to γH, the
derived nT [inset in Fig. 6(d)] also shows a significant
change in its temperature dependence at T ≈50 K. At
T ≥50 K, the temperature dependence of nT is roughly
linear. Interestingly, it can also be described by nT ¼ n0 þ
αTe−Δ=kBT [dashed line in the inset in Fig. 6(d) with
n0 ¼ 0.7, α ¼ 5.4 × 10−3, and Δ ¼ 5.18 meV], analogous
to the temperature dependence of the carrier density arising
from carriers thermally excited over a pseudogap Δ in
cuprates [52,53]. At T ≤45 K, nT changes with temperature
at a much higher rate. The temperature (approximately
50 K) at which nT changes its temperature sensitivity is
coincident with that of a transition into an antiferromagnetic
orthorhombic phase [35] (inset in Fig. S8 and discussion in
its caption [47]). While further investigations are needed to
account for the temperature behavior of nT at temperatures
above and below approximately 50 K, the results in Fig. 6
demonstrate that our extended Kohler’s rule works when the
scaling following Eq. (3) is obeyed. This provides exper-
imental support for the conclusion in Sec. III. A that Eq. (1)
can be expressed as Eq. (3) when the mobilities of the

MRs in BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2 (Fig. 6, up to 2% at H ¼ 9 T).
Furthermore, the above discussions show that nT can be an
indicator of a temperature-induced phase transition, if it
exhibits a sudden change in the temperature sensitivity.
2. Extended Kohler’s rule of magnetoresistance in
semiconductor InSb
Following the discussions in Secs. III. A and III. B, it can
be challenging to account for the temperature behavior of
nT derived from our extended Kohler’s rule of Eq. (1) in
semimetals and in the normal state of a superconductor. In
the former case, one needs to know detailed information of
the semimetal’s electronic band structure that can be
sample dependent [44,45]. In the normal state of a super-
conductor, nT can be governed by more than one mecha-
nism besides the electronic band structure, such as a
pseudogap. In order to unambiguously validate the
extended Kohler’s rule of Eq. (1), we apply the scaling
to the magnetoresistance of an undoped semiconductor.
Kohler’s rule is presumed to be violated due to the expected
exponential temperature dependence of the intrinsic carrier
density ni ∼T3=2e−Eg=2kBT with Eg being the band gap [49],
providing an exemplar system to showcase our extended
Kohler’s rule, Eq. (1). Its compensated nature also sim-
plifies the analysis using Eqs. (S1) and (S2) [47] of the
conventional two-band model, as discussed in Sec. III. A.
We choose InSb, which is a narrow-gap semiconductor [54]
with resistivities conveniently measurable at around room
temperature [55]. Its temperature-dependent band gap Eg is
available in the literature [54], enabling comparisons of the
temperature dependence of nT with that of the calculated ni
and/or of the reported band gap with that derived from nT.
Its
large
MR
[55]
(up
to
approximately
103%
at
T > 250 K) implies high carrier mobility, extending the
range of the carrier mobility and enabling the validation of
Eq. (4), from which scaling Eq. (3) is deduced at low carrier
mobility. More importantly, we find a very large (>102)
ratio (μe=μh) of the electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobility in
InSb, where the carrier density ni is practically the same as
that (nH) obtained from Hall measurements (Fig. S2 and
caption [47]). This allows a further verification of nT using
the experimentally determined carrier density.
We present typical ρxxðHÞ curves of InSb around room
temperature in Fig. 7(a). We focus on data obtained at T ≥
240 K to avoid interference of quantum magnetoresistance
that can occur at lower temperatures [55] and the contri-
bution to the magnetoresistance by the residual impurity in

041029-9the nominally undoped crystal (Fig. S10 and caption [47]).
As expected for a semiconductor, ρxx increases with
decreasing temperature [also Fig. S10(a) [47]]. Figure 7(c)
shows that Kohler’s rule is violated in InSb. In fact, the
curves in the Kohler’s rule plot are separated from each
other even further, compared to those prior to the scaling
[Fig. 7(b)]. This is in contrast to those shown in Figs. 2(a)
and 2(b) and in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) for a semimetal (TaP)
and for a superconductor [BaFe2ðAs2−xPÞ2] in the normal
state, because their zero-field resistivity ρ0 has opposite
temperature dependence to that of the semiconducting
InSb. On the other hand, our extended Kohler’s rule
[Eq. (1)] can collapse all the data into a single curve
[Fig. 7(d)]. The temperature dependence of the derived nT
can be well described theoretically [Fig. S11(b) [47]],
unveiling band gaps comparable to those determined from
other methods in the literature [inset in Fig. S11(b) [47]]. It
is nearly indistinguishable to that of the experimental Hall
carrier density nH obtained from the ρxyðHÞ curves
[Fig. S11(a) [47]] as well as carrier density ni [Fig. S12(c)
[47]] obtained by simultaneous fittings of ρxxðHÞ and
ρxyðHÞ curves using the two-band model [Fig. S12(a)
[47]]. These results evidently prove the validity of our
extended Kohler’s rule Eq. (1) in semiconducting InSb,
further demonstrating its generality. As presented in Fig. 7(e),
a plot of MR versus tan2θH can also collapse all data into one
common curve, which becomes, however, nonlinear with
increasing magnetic field. This indicates that MR is not
proportional to tan2θH; i.e., the scaling provided by Eq. (3) is
not valid. The reason is that Eq. (3) is deducible from Eq. (4)
only when the carrier mobility is very low so that the
magnetoresistance MR is negligible, i.e., ρxxðHÞ ≈ρ0. On
the other hand, Fig. 7(f) shows that the general form Eq. (4)
does work well in InSb over the entire field range, confirming
that in a compensated two-band system Eq. (4), i.e.,
MR ¼ γHðρxy=ρ0Þ2, can be derived from the extended
Kohler’s rule Eq. (1), regardless of the value of the carrier
mobility.
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Since it was proposed more than 80 years ago for orbital
magnetoresistances in nonmagnetic metals, Kohler’s rule
has been widely used to account for the magnetoresistance
behavior in materials beyond simple metals, including
cuprate and iron-based superconductors as well as in
topological materials. On one hand, it offers a phenom-
enological
understanding
of
novel
magnetoresistance
phenomena such as the turn-on temperature behavior of
the magnetoresistance in topological materials. On the
other hand, its violations have been often reported and
attributed to temperature-induced phase transitions or other
unconventional mechanisms. Stimulated by the widely
reported violations of Kohler’s rule in the newly discovered
topological semimetals, we tackled the ubiquitous ther-
mally induced changes in the carrier density. We used a low
carrier density, type-I Weyl semimetal, TaP, to establish an
extended Kohler’s rule [Eq. (1)], which takes into account
the role played by the temperature dependence of the carrier
density. We demonstrated how the extended Kohler’s rule
naturally reduces to the original Kohler’s rule in materials
such as metals whose carrier density is so high that the
temperature-induced change in it is experimentally indis-
tinguishable. We applied our extended Kohler’s rule to
account for other alternative scaling forms of magneto-
resistance, particularly the widely debated scaling behavior
of MR ∼tan2θH [Eq. (3)] discovered in cuprates and often
applied to other superconductors. We showed that Eq. (3)
can be deduced from our extended Kohler’s rule Eq. (1)
when the carrier mobility is very low. We also conducted
measurements on the normal-state magnetoresistance in
superconductor
BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2
to
demonstrate
that
Eq. (1) is valid when the scaling Eq. (3) is observed.
We further demonstrated the validation and generality of
the extended Kohler’s rule by investigating the magneto-
resistance in a narrow-gap semiconductor, InSb, whose
carrier density is expected to change strongly with temper-
ature and can be determined both theoretically and
experimentally.
Our extended Kohler’s rule Eq. (1) offers a fundamental
understanding of the violation and validity of Kohler’s rule
in terms of different temperature responses of the thermal
factor nT, with nT ¼ 1 denoting the original Kohler’s rule.
The results for TaP and InSb evidently show that nT
represents the temperature dependence of the carrier
density, providing an alternative way to reveal information
on the electronic band structure, e.g., Fermi level (in TaP)
and band gap (in InSb). On the other hand, our extended
Kohler’s rule is inconclusive in understanding the temper-
ature dependence of nT in BaFe2ðAs1−xPxÞ2, which is a
multiband system and where other mechanisms such as the
pseudogap may also contribute to the thermally induced
change in the carrier density. In general, we expect nT to
reflect the temperature dependence of the carrier density in
(i) single-band (or one dominant band) systems and
(ii) two-band and multiband materials whose carrier density
and mobility in all bands have the same or similar temper-
ature dependence, as demonstrated by the experimental
results in the two-band systems TaP and InSb as well as the
derived formulas of the compensated two-band systems and
also noncompensated two-band and multiband materials.
The temperature behavior of the thermal factor nT depends
on that of both carrier density and mobility, if a system with
two or more bands has different temperature dependences
for the carrier density and mobility in each band. In this
case, detailed information of the carrier densities and
mobilities of all bands is required to calculate nT, making
the comparison of theory and experiments more challeng-
ing. Further work on more materials is needed to ultimately

041029-10determine the limitations of our extended Kohler’s rule. We
note that other mechanisms can also cause violations of
Kohler’s rule. This work demonstrates that thermal effects
on the carrier density and mobility may need to be
considered before new mechanisms are proposed.

deriva-
tions of the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance in an
anisotropic single-band system as well as a two-band or
multiband system with low carrier mobility. It also includes
(i) experimental data from sample TP2 and sample PH; (ii)
additional data from sample TP1 and associated results from
two-band model analysis; (iii) additional experimental data
and analysis for sample IS; (iv) relationship between carrier
density derived from the Hall effect measurements and the
true carrier density in a compensated two-band system; and
(v) effects of the Fermi level and dispersion relation on the
temperature dependence of the thermal factor nT in the
extended Kohler’s rule.
