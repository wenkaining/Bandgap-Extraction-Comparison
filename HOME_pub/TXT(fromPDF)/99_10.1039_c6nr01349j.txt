New classes two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene, including layered and non-
layered, and their heterostructures, are currently attracting increasing interest due to their promis-
ing applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and clean energy, where thermal transport
property is one of the fundamental physical parameters.
In this paper, we systematically in-
vestigated the phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS,
GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) based on ﬁrst-principles
calculations. Despite the similar puckered (hinge-like) structure along the armchair direction as
phosphorene, the four monolayer compounds possess diverse anisotropic properties in many as-
pects, such as phonon group velocity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal conductivity (κ), etc.
Especially, the κ along the zigzag and armchair directions of monolayer GeS shows the strongest
anisotropy while monolayer SnS and SnSe shows an almost isotropy in phonon transport. The ori-
gin of the diverse anisotropy is fully studied and the underlying mechanism is discussed in detail.
With limited size, the κ could be effectively lowered, and the anisotropy could be effectively mod-
ulated by nanostructuring, which would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and
thermal management. Our study offers fundamental understanding of the anisotropic phonon
transport properties of 2D materials, and would be of signiﬁcance for further study, modulation
and applications in emerging technologies.

Introduction
The bulk orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS
and SnSe possessing puckered (hinge-like) layered structure sim-
ilar to black phosphorous have become a hot spot of recent re-
searches.1–6 The advantages of group IV-VI compounds, such as
earth-abundance, environmental compatibility, less toxicity, and
chemical stability, make them very attractive for large-scale ap-
plications in photovoltaics and thermoelectrics.1,2,6–9 There have
been a lot of studies on their optical properties including the pho-
toconductivity, refractive index and infrared- and Raman-activity

from experiments10–13 and ﬁrst-principles calculations.14,15 The
large thermopower, high power factors, and low thermal con-
ductivities estimated using Cahill’s model16 make these four
orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds promising candidates for
high-efﬁcient thermoelectric materials.17 Bulk SnSe is especially
a robust thermoelectric candidate for energy conversion appli-
cations in the low and moderate temperature range due to its
anisotropic and low symmetry crystal structure.1,2
The discovery of graphene leads to an upsurge in explor-
ing two-dimensional (2D) materials,18–21 such as hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN), germanene, silicene, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and phosphorene, which have at-
tracted tremendous attention due to their unique dimension-
dependent properties.22 In addition to the currently available 2D
materials, 2D SnSe has been recently synthesized, which is greatly
expected to be potential in the applications as photodetector, pho-
tovoltaic, piezoelectric and thermoelectric devices.23–27 Mono-
layer SnSe is also reported to be a promising 2D anisotropic semi-
conductor for nanomechanics, thermoelectrics, and optoelectron-
ics,28 and the quantum spin Hall effect was predicted in (111)-
oriented thin ﬁlms of SnSe.29 Beyond the speciﬁc studies on 2D

DOI: 10.1039/C6NR01349JSnSe, there have also been a lot of studies on the optical proper-
ties of the four 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS,
GeSe, SnS and SnSe.12–14 Furthermore, they are also reported as
ﬂexible, stable, and efﬁcient 2D piezoelectric materials possess-
ing enormous, anisotropic piezoelectric effects with the piezoelec-
tric coefﬁcients about two orders of magnitude larger than those
of other 2D or bulk materials, such as MoS2, GaSe, bulk quartz
and AlN, which are widely used in industry.25,30 These novel
2D anisotropic semiconductors, which attracted tremendous in-
terest recently, have great potential applications in nanoelectron-
ics, optoelectronics and thermoelectrics, calling for fundamental
study of the phonon transport properties. However, the phonon
transport properties of these 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI com-
pounds are still less known except monolayer SnSe.26–28 A com-
plete and comparative prediction and understanding of the un-
derlying phonon transport properties is the key to expand the
range of their applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and
thermoelectrics.
In this paper, we conduct comprehensive investigations of the
diverse phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group
IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltz-
mann transport equation (BTE) based on ﬁrst-principles calcula-
tions. The four monolayer compounds, although possessing simi-
lar hinge-like structure along the armchair direction as phospho-
rene, show diverse anisotropic properties in many aspects, such
as phonon group velocity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal
conductivity (κ), etc. The remainder of the paper is organized
as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy describe the methodology for the
ﬁrst-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport theory of
phonon transport. In Sec. 3 and 4, the optimized structures and
phonon dispersions for the studied systems are presented, respec-
tively. In Sec. 5, we study the phonon transport properties of the
four monolayer compounds with hinge-like orthorhombic struc-
ture. Furthermore, a detailed analysis on the diverse anisotropic
properties is presented in Sec. 6 from different aspects, including
mode level κ and average phonon group velocity, phonon scatter-
ing channels and electron localization function (ELF). In Sec. 7,
the effect of ﬁnite size on κ and the anisotropy is studied. In
Sec. 8, we present the summary and conclusions.

Methodology
All the ﬁrst-principles calculations are performed based on the
density functional theory (DFT) using the projector augmented
wave (PAW) method31 as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio
simulation package (VASP)32.
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE)33 of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is chosen
as the exchange-correlation functional. The kinetic energy cut-
off of wave functions is 650eV for GeS and SnS, and 550eV for
GeSe and SnSe, respectively, which are 2.5 times the maximal rec-
ommended cutoff in the pseudo-potentials. A Monkhorst-Pack34
k-mesh of 11×11×1 is adopted to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ)
of all the four monolayer compounds, with the energy conver-
gence threshold set as 10−8 eV. In the supercell calculations for
obtaining harmonic (second order) interatomic force constants
(IFCs) and anharmonic (third order) IFCs, only Γ point in the re-
ciprocal space is used for the purpose of saving resources.5 For
2D systems, a large vacuum spacing is necessary to avoid the
interactions between layers arising from the employed periodic
boundary conditions. The vacuum spacing is set as at least 15Å
along the out-of-plane direction that is sufﬁciently large. Both
the cell shape and volume are fully optimized and all atoms are
allowed to relax until the maximal Hellmann-Feynman force act-
ing on each atom is no larger than 0.001eV/Å.
A sufﬁcient large supercell is necessary for the accurate pre-
diction of phonon dispersions, which is important for determin-
ing the phonon group velocities and phonon-phonon interactions
that is critical for predicting thermal properties. In principle, the
supercell should be constructed to ensure lattice constants to be
at least larger than 10Å. To determine the supercell size used in
the real-space ﬁnite displacement difference calculations, we per-
formed calculations with the supercell size of 2×2×1, 3×3×1,
4 × 4 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 1.
The corresponding phonon dispersion
curves show a convergent tendency as the supercell size increas-
ing, such as the coupling among optical and acoustic phonon
branches, the smoothness of the phonon dispersion curves, the
frequency shift of phonon modes at Γ-point, and the ﬂat disper-
sions near the S symmetry point.
Since there is no difference
between the results obtained with the supercell size of 4 × 4 × 1
and 5×5×1, it is doubtless that the supercell size of 5×5×1 is a
good choice.
The force constant Ciα; jβ can be obtained from the force caused
by displacement:
Ciα; jβ = −Fiα
∆jβ
,
(1)
where Fiα is the force along the α direction acting on atom i
resulted from the displacement along the β direction of atom j
(∆jβ ). The displacement amplitude of atom along the ±x, ±y and
±z directions are 0.01Å. The space group symmetry properties
are used to reduce the calculation cost and numerical noise of the
force constants, and it can also greatly simplify the determination
of the dynamical matrix that is constructed based on the force
constants. The frequency and eigenvector forming the phonon
dispersions can be obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical ma-
trix.
Besides the harmonic IFCs obtained above, anharmonic IFCs,
which are used for the determination of the scattering properties,
are also necessary in the calculation of lattice thermal conductiv-
ity (κ). A 4×4×1 supercell is constructed to get the anharmonic
IFCs, and the ﬁrst-principles based real-space ﬁnite displacement
difference approach is employed. A cutoff radius (rcutoff) is in-
troduced to discard the interactions between atoms with distance
larger than a certain value for practical purposes. In principle, the
rcutoff should exceed the range of physically relevant anharmonic
interactions to get satisfactory results.35,36 Here, referring to the
converged cutoff radius as examined in the previous work, we
choose a cutoff radius of about 6.5Å, which includes up to 15th,
14th, 13th and 11th nearest neighbors for GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe,
respectively.5 The dielectric tensor and Born effective charges are
also obtained to take into account of long-range electrostatic in-
teractions.
We choose the thickness of monolayer as half the
length of the lattice constant along the out-of-plane direction of

conventional cell.37 The speciﬁc values of the thickness of the
four monolayer compounds are listed in Table 1.
The lattice thermal conductivity (κ) is calculated by solv-
ing the linearized BTE for phonons.
At thermal equilibrium,
the phonons are distributed obeying the Bose-Einstein function
f0(ωλ ) in the absence of temperature gradient or other thermo-
dynamical forces.38 The λ is the index of phonon mode compris-
ing both phonon polarization p and wave vector qqq. The ωλ is the
angular frequency. In the steady state with a temperature gradi-
ent ∇T, the phonon distribution function fλ deviates from f0(ωλ )
and this deviation can be obtained from the BTE:
∂fλ
∂t = ∇T ·vvvλ
∂fλ
∂T ,
(2)
where vvvλ is the phonon group velocity. The left side is the scat-
tering term that can be determined by taking into account the an-
harmonic scattering due to intrinsic phonon-phonon interactions
and the harmonic scattering due to defects and impurities such
as isotopes.38 The right side is the diffusion term caused by the
temperature gradient ∇T. Assuming a small enough ∇T in most
practical situations, Eq. (2) can be linearized in ∇T and re-written
as:
fλ −f0(ωλ ) = −FFFλ ·∇T df0
dT ,
(3)
where FFFλ = τ0
λ (vvvλ + ∆∆∆λ ) when only considering the scattering
mechanism of three-phonon processes.39–42 Here, τ0
λ is the relax-
ation time obtained from perturbation theory, which is commonly
used within the relaxation time approximation (RTA), and ∆∆∆λ in
the dimension of velocity is a correction of the deviation to the
RTA prediction. The τ0
λ can be computed as:

and Γλλ ′ is the scattering possibility resulted from the disorder of

Eq. (3) is numerically solved by iterating from a zeroth order
approximation start of FFFλ = τ0
λ vvvλ . If the iteration stops at the
ﬁrst step, the procedure is equivalent to the operation in the RTA.
The iterative procedure has a large impact on the study of materi-
als such as diamond in which the normal processes play a signif-
icant role in the phonon-phonon scattering.40 In such situations,
the RTA treating the normal processes resistive cannot yield rea-
sonable results. In contrast, in materials such as Si and Ge with
strong Umklapp scattering, iterating to convergence only leads to
a less than 10% increase of the room temperature κ compared
to the RTA result.39 Based on the solution, the heat ﬂux can be
calculated and the κ can be obtained in terms of FFFλ :

Structures
The cell shape, volume and atoms are fully relaxed till conver-
gence reached. Along with the monolayer of black phosphorus
that is called phosphorene, the optimized structures of mono-
layer GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe are shown in Fig. 1(a) from left
to right. All these monolayer materials belong to the same or-
thorhombic crystal system, and possess similar hinge-like struc-
ture along the armchair direction, which is a typical feature dis-
tinctly different from the ﬂat graphene and buckled silicene. As
reviewed in previous work, the hinge-like structure will intro-
duce strong anisotropic properties.45,46 For example, it is harder
along the zigzag direction than that along the armchair direction,
which can be veriﬁed by the Young’s modulus. The hinge-like or-
thorhombic structure generally leads to the lattice constants be-
ing larger along armchair direction than along zigzag direction.
The obtained lattice constants along the two lattice directions are
different, as listed in Table 1. The difference from large to small
is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe. Compared with mono-
layer GeS and GeSe, the difference of lattice constants along the
two directions for monolayer SnS and SnSe are very small, leading
to their symmetric square-like lattice structures. This symmetric
square-like lattice structure may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
atomic bonding along the two directions, and will lead to their
less anisotropic properties, as we will see later.
All the space groups of the four monolayer compounds are the

same Pmn21 (No. 31), possessing 4 symmetry operators, which
is different from that of phosphorene (Pmna (No. 53), possessing
8 symmetry operators). The lower symmetry of the four mono-
layer compounds compared with phosphorene lies in the different
types of atoms constituting the compounds, in which the two sub-
layers are not parallel to each other. It is interesting to note from
Fig. 1(a) that the metallic atoms Ge interpose between the non-
metallic (metalloid) atoms Se along the out-of-plane direction in
monolayer GeSe, which is different from that in monolayer GeS,
SnS and SnSe where the non-metallic atoms interpose between
the metallic atoms along the out-of-plane direction. The differ-
ence may be due to the same period of Ge and Se in the periodic
table resulting in the closest mass of the two atoms and the small-
est electronegativity difference in the binary compound.

Phonon dispersions
In the calculation of phonon dispersions, a 5×5×1 supercell con-
taining 100 atoms is constructed and the ﬁrst-principles based ﬁ-
nite displacement difference method is employed.47,48 As shown
in Fig. 2, the phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS, SnS, GeSe
and SnSe have no imaginary part, indicating the thermodynamic
stability of the four monolayer compounds. There exist 3 acoustic
and 9 optical, that is 12 in total, phonon branches corresponding
to the 4 atoms per unit cell. The three lowest phonon branches
are acoustic phonon branches, i.e. the out-of-plane ﬂexural acous-
tic (FA) branch, the in-plane transverse acoustic (TA) branch and
the in-plane longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch. The TA and LA
branches is linear near the Γ point while the FA branch is ﬂexural,
which is similar to other 2D materials such as graphene, silicene,
and phosphorene.46,49–52 This ﬂexural feature is typically due to
the 2D nature of monolayer structure.50
The four monolayer compounds show very similar dispersion
curves along the path passing through the main high-symmetry
k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) except: 1) The
phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS and GeSe are separated into
two regions with each region possessing 6 branches. There exists
a gap between the two regions. The gap is 2.014THz for mono-
layer GeS and 0.105THz for monolayer GeSe. However, there is
no similar gap for monolayer SnS and SnSe. 2) The phonon dis-
persions of SnS and SnSe are characterized by markedly dispersive
optical phonon branches, which lead to the disappearance of the
gap and result in signiﬁcant group velocities of optical phonon
branches. 3) The frequencies of the four monolayer compounds
are different, especially the maximum frequency (ωM) of optical
phonon branches at Γ point, and the order of ωM is monolayer
GeS > SnS > GeSe > SnSe. This may be owing to the different re-
duced atomic mass (µ = m1m2/(m1 + m2)) that the larger the µ
the lower the maximum frequency. The order of µ of the four
monolayer compounds is GeS < SnS < GeSe < SnSe that is oppo-
site to the order of ωM.

and SnS are ampliﬁed as clearly shown in the insert. (b) Anisotropic κ
along zigzag and armchair directions at 300K for the four monolayer

From the overview of Fig. 2, it is obvious that monolayer SnS
and SnSe possess almost symmetric phonon dispersion curves
along the Γ-X-S (left) and Γ-Y-S (right) high-symmetry k-paths,
while the symmetry for monolayer GeS is most broken, especially
for the low-frequency phonon modes. As a result, the anisotropy
of phonon group velocity along the two different directions of
monolayer SnS and SnSe is tiny, and that of monolayer GeS and
GeSe is much larger. Based on the slope of the LA branch near the
Γ point, we could get the group velocities along Γ-X (zigzag) and
Γ-Y (armchair) directions, respectively. As listed in Table 1, the
speciﬁc values of the group velocities of the four monolayer com-
pounds show different anisotropy along the zigzag and armchair
directions. The anisotropy of group velocities along the two direc-
tions from large to small is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe.
From the lattice constants as listed in Table 1, it is found that
the order of anisotropy of group velocities is the same as that of
lattice constants. It is reviewed in previous work that the hinge-
like structure of phosphorene is the key to the strong anisotropy

of its properties.45,46 However, monolayer SnSe shows an almost
isotropic behavior despite its similar hinge-like structure as phos-
phorene. The reason may lie in the symmetric square-like lattice
structure28 and the large atomic mass of Sn and Se, which coun-
teract the anisotropy introduced by its hinge-like structure.

Phonon transport properties
Based on the harmonic and anharmonic IFCs, the lattice ther-
mal conductivity (κ) is calculated by solving the linearized BTE
for phonons. The phonon Q-grid sampling (N × N) in the BZ as
shown in Eq. (4) has been fully tested for the convergence of κ.
The N of 46, 68, 47 and 48 are chosen for getting the conver-
gent κ of monolayer GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe, respectively. The

much denser Q-grid needed for getting convergent κ for mono-
layer GeSe is directly due to the much slower convergence of the
κ along armchair direction. The reason might lie in the fact that
there are more long-wavelength phonons contributing to the κ
along armchair direction in monolayer GeSe, which would require
denser Q-grid to capture their behavior near the zone center. The
phenomenon is consistent with the largest rMFP along armchair
direction of monolayer GeSe as shown in Table 1. By employing
the iterative method, the obtained κ along zigzag and armchair
directions of the four monolayer compounds at different temper-
atures are collected together for comparison, as shown in Fig. 3.
The speciﬁc values of κ at 300K are listed in Table 1. We also cal-
culated the κ by using the RTA method, and found that iterating
to convergence will lead to monolayer GeS: (36.5%, 22.3%), GeSe:
(13.9%, 8.7%), SnS: (15.8%, 16.5%) and SnSe: (11.6%, 11.3%) in-
crease of the room temperature κ compared to the RTA results,
which means stronger Umklapp scattering existing in monolayer
GeSe, SnS and SnSe than monolayer GeS. The two numbers in
the parentheses are the ratio of increase for zigzag and armchair
directions, respectively. The calculated κ at different tempera-
tures as shown in Fig. 3(a) decrease with temperature increas-
ing. By ﬁtting with the relation of κ ∼1/T α, the parameter α
are almost equal to 1, as listed in Table 1, which is consistent
with the common behavior of κ at medium temperatures for semi-
conductors.46,53,54
The average κ along the two directions of the four mono-
layer compounds and bulk SnSe are GeS (6.38Wm−1K−1), GeSe
(5.23Wm−1K−1), SnS (3.08Wm−1K−1), SnSe (2.77Wm−1K−1)
and bulk SnSe (1.31Wm−1K−1), respectively. They possess the
rather low thermal conductivity compared to a lot of mate-
rials, such as h-BN, MoS2, graphene, silicene, phosphorene,
etc.46,51,55,56 The κ is strongly affected by the scattering pro-
cesses, which can be inﬂuenced by the anharmonic nature of
structure and the number of allowed three-phonon scattering pro-

cesses, which are quantiﬁed as the Grüneisen parameters (γ) and
anharmonic phase space volume (P3), respectively.5 The order
of κ is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe > bulk SnSe, which
is consistent with the order of P3 as shown in Fig. 4(c) except
monolayer GeS. Though monolayer GeS has the largest κ, it does
not possess a smallest P3. However, its γ at low frequency range
is obviously much smaller than the other monolayer compounds.
The anharmonic nature of monolayer GeS is weak compared to
the other monolayer compounds, resulting in its largest κ. The
largest κ of monolayer GeS could also be understood from its
phonon dispersion. As compared in Sec. 4, the phonon dispersion
of monolayer GeS possess the largest gap of 2.014THz (Fig. 2(a)),
which is much larger than that of monolayer GeSe (0.105THz),
while monolayer SnS and SnSe have no gap. The large phonon
energy gap causes that the scattering of acoustic phonon modes
due to the optical phonon modes is much weaker57, which leads
to the higher κ of monolayer GeS. Though there is a big gap in
the phonon dispersion of bulk SnSe as well, the κ of bulk SnSe is
lower than that of monolayer SnSe. The reason might be that the
interactions between layers in bulk SnSe leads to smaller phonon
group velocity in the in-plane transport and enhanced scatter-
ing of phonons due to the giant anharmonicity,58 thus result in
the lower in-plane κ.
Considering the higher κ of monolayer
SnSe than bulk SnSe, the thermoelectric performance of mono-
layer SnSe might be not as good as bulk SnSe. But it is hard to
deﬁnitely say how the thermoelectric performance would be, be-
cause it is determined by several strongly coupled quantities and
the thermal conductivity contributed from phonons is only one of
them.45 We also notice that the κ of bulk SnSe from calculations is
larger than that from experiment. The reason of the discrepancy
may lie in two aspects: 1) The samples used for experimental
measurements may have defects that would lower the κ. 2) For
such a material with giant anharmonicity,58 only considering the
third order IFCs for capturing the anharmonicity might be not suf-
ﬁcient. The κ is anticipated to be further lowered if higher order
IFCs are considered.
To have a clear overview of the constituent of κ, the frequency
dependent κ and average phonon group velocity of monolayer
GeS, SnS, GeSe, SnSe and bulk SnSe along zigzag and armchair
directions are plotted in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), the
group velocities of monolayer SnS and SnSe of the optical phonon
branches, especially around middle frequency range (where the
phonon dispersion can be separated into two regions with each
region containing 6 branches), are very large in a wide range.
This is consistent with the phonon dispersions of monolayer SnS
and SnSe as shown in Fig. 2 that are characterized by markedly
dispersive optical phonon branches, which lead to their signiﬁ-
cant group velocities. From the frequency dependent κ as shown
in the top panel, it is obvious that the κ at middle frequency range
of monolayer SnS and SnSe takes up a relatively larger propor-
tion than that of monolayer GeS and GeSe, which is due to their
relatively larger group velocities of the optical phonon modes at
middle frequency range. The relaxation time also have some in-
ﬂuence on the contributions to κ of phonon branches. For exam-
ple, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the relaxation time of monolayer GeS
(black color) at high frequency range above the gap are much
smaller than that at low frequency range below the gap.
Al-
though monolayer GeS have relatively large phonon group veloc-
ity at high frequency range, as shown in Fig. 5(a), optical phonon
branches above the gap contribute little to κ. As for bulk SnSe
(cyan color), as shown in Fig. 4(b), the relaxation time at high
frequency range above the gap of bulk SnSe are comparable to
that at low frequency range below the gap, which is due to the
valley of P3 as shown in Fig. 4(c). Together with its relatively
large phonon group velocity at high frequency range, as shown
in the insert in Fig. 5(d), optical phonon branches above the gap
contribute a lot to κ.
The contributions of different phonon branches(FA, TA, LA and
optical) to κ at 300K are extracted as listed in Table 1. The contri-
butions of optical phonon branches increase with the increasing
temperature, and at the same time the contributions of acoustic
phonon branches decrease. The cumulative κ as a function of the
phonon mean free path (MFP) at 300K for zigzag and armchair
directions are ﬁtted to a single parametric function38,46

respectively. κ0 is the ultimate cumulated κ, lmax is the maximal
MFP concerned, and l0 is the parameter to be evaluated by ﬁt-
ting. The ﬁtted curves reproduce the calculated data quite well
and yield the parameter l0 for zigzag and armchair directions, re-
spectively, which could be interpreted as the representative MFP

DOI: 10.1039/C6NR01349J(rMFP). The rMFP, as listed in Table 1, is helpful for the study
of the size effect on the ballistic or diffusive phonon transport,
which is important for thermal design with nanostructuring. The
rMFP decrease with the increasing temperature due to the inte-
gral decrease of MFP and higher contributions to κ coming from
optical phonon branches at higher temperature.
Generally speaking, acoustic phonon branches possess larger
MFP while optical phonon branches possess smaller MFP, and for
acoustic phonon branches lower frequency phonon modes pos-
sess larger MFP. Higher contributions of optical phonon branches
to κ will lead to smaller rMFP, and higher contributions of acous-
tic phonon branches to κ, especially from FA, will lead to larger
rMFP. It is noticed from Table 1 that the contributions to κ from
optical phonon branches for monolayer SnS and SnSe are much
larger than that for monolayer GeS and GeSe, and bulk SnSe has
much larger contributions to κ from optical phonon branches
compared with the four monolayer compounds. Thus bulk SnSe
has the smallest rMFP, and monolayer SnS and SnSe have smaller
rMFP than monolayer GeS and GeSe.
Furthermore, for mono-
layer GeSe, the rMFP along zigzag direction is much smaller than
that along armchair direction, while for monolayer SnS, the rMFP
along zigzag direction is slightly smaller than that along arm-
chair direction. For other monolayer compounds, the rMFP along
zigzag direction is larger than that along armchair direction. For
monolayer GeSe, contributions to κ from FA in zigzag direction
is smaller than that in armchair direction while contributions to
κ from optical branches in zigzag direction is larger than that
in armchair direction. Both factors together result in the much
smaller rMFP in zigzag direction than that in armchair direction
for monolayer GeSe. For monolayer SnS, contributions to κ from
FA in zigzag direction is smaller than that in armchair direction,
and contributions to κ from optical phonon branches in zigzag
direction is also smaller than that in armchair direction. The two
competing factors result in the slightly smaller rMFP in zigzag di-
rection than that in armchair direction for monolayer SnS. For
monolayer GeS, SnSe and bulk SnSe, contributions to κ from FA
in zigzag direction is larger than that in armchair direction while
contributions to κ from optical phonon branches in zigzag direc-
tion is smaller than that in armchair direction, which is contrary
to the case of monolayer GeSe. Both factors together result in the
larger rMFP in zigzag direction than that in armchair direction.

Analysis of the anisotropy
6.1
Anisotropy of phonon transport
A distinct feature in Fig. 3 is that, all the four monolayer com-
pounds and bulk SnSe possess anisotropic κ.
To have a clear
comparison of the anisotropy, we plot the κ along zigzag and
armchair directions at 300K for the four monolayer compounds
and bulk SnSe in Fig. 3(b).
It is obvious that the κ of mono-
layer GeS possesses the strongest anisotropy compared to all the
other monolayer compounds, and the κ along the zigzag di-
rection of monolayer GeS is much larger than others.
The κ
along zigzag and armchair directions of monolayer SnSe shows
less anisotropic behavior than that of bulk SnSe. The order of
anisotropy of the κ of the four monolayer compounds is mono-
layer GeS > GeSe > SnSe > SnS. We further calculated the Young’s
modulus and found that its order of anisotropy is monolayer
GeS > GeSe > SnSe > SnS, which is identical with that of κ. The
speciﬁc values of the Young’s modulus of the four monolayer com-
pounds are listed in Table 1, and the related elastic constants are
shown in Table 2.

From Fig. 5, it is clearly shown that the anisotropic behavior
of κ is keeping pace with that of phonon group velocity, as phe-
nomenologically shown in Eq. (5). The anisotropy of thermal con-
ductivity is actually dominated by the anisotropy of phonon group
velocity.59 A close view of Fig. 5 shows that the frequency depen-
dent κ and average phonon group velocity are nearly isotropic
for high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency
(where the gap locates), which separates the phonon dispersion
into two regions containing equal numbers of branches.
The
anisotropy along the two different directions is conspicuous for
low frequency phonon modes below the separatrix frequency,
which is huge for monolayer GeS, small for monolayer GeSe,
while almost disappear for monolayer SnS and SnSe. Note that
the phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS and GeSe as shown in
Fig. 2 are separated into two regions containing equal numbers
of branches with a gap of 2.014THz and 0.105THz, respectively,
while there is no gap for monolayer SnS and SnSe. Thus we ana-
lyzed that it is the regions below the separatrix frequency where
the gap locates that result in the anisotropy. The anisotropy is
strong for monolayer GeS and weak for monolayer GeSe due to
the big gap in the phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS and the
small gap of monolayer GeSe. While there is no gap of monolayer
SnS and SnSe, their κ and phonon group velocity along the two
different directions are almost isotropic. Thus the anisotropy is
associated with the gap of phonon dispersions that the larger the
gap the stronger the anisotropy. If we could employ some meth-
ods such as strain or doping to modulate the gap, the anisotropy
can be effectively modulated, which would be of signiﬁcance in
the thermal management applications. The inﬂuence of the gap
on the anisotropy can be understood in terms of the coupling be-
tween the high and low frequency phonon modes at both sides
of the separatrix frequency, which is supported by the scatter-
ing channels among phonon modes presented in the next section
(Sec. 6.2). Since the frequency dependent average phonon group
velocity of the four monolayer compounds is nearly isotropic for
high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency,
the coupling will suppress the anisotropy of the low frequency
phonon modes below the separatrix frequency when there is no
gap. When a gap exists, the coupling will be weak, leading to the

Fig. 6 (Color online) Scattering rate of acoustic phonon modes along Γ-Y direction for monolayer (a) GeS, (b) GeSe, (c) SnS and (d) SnSe as labeled on
site. The top panel is for LA branch, the middle panel is for TA branch, and the bottom panel is for FA branch. In the legend, "A" means the acoustic
phonon branches (LA, TA and FA), "O1" means the 3 optical phonon branches with low frequency, "O2" means the 6 optical phonon branches with
high frequency. The legends similar for LA, TA and FA are the same for (b) GeSe, (c) SnS and (d) SnSe, while that for (a) GeS is different. The crossover
of LA, TA and O1 as shown in Fig. 2 is ﬁxed manually to distinguish them.
presence of the anisotropy. If the gap is very large, the coupling
disappears, resulting in the appearance of the strong anisotropy
of low frequency phonon modes.
Based on the analysis demonstrated above, we also would like
to present a speciﬁc comparison for monolayer SnSe and bulk
SnSe.
Monolayer SnSe shows less anisotropic properties along
zigzag and armchair directions than bulk SnSe. There exist some
differences between them: 1) The most signiﬁcant difference is
that there is no interactions between layers in monolayer SnSe.
2) The difference of lattice constants along the two directions of
monolayer SnSe is much less than that of bulk SnSe, leading to its
symmetric square-like lattice structure which determines its al-
most isotropic properties. 3) The Young’s modulus of monolayer
SnSe is larger than that of bulk SnSe, which means that monolayer
SnSe is more rigid than bulk SnSe, leading to the larger phonon
group velocity and κ of monolayer SnSe. 4) There is no gap in the
phonon dispersion of monolayer SnSe, while there is a large gap
for bulk SnSe. The low and high frequency phonon modes at both
sides of the gap are decoupled in bulk SnSe due to the large gap,
resulting in the huge anisotropy of the phonon group velocity and
contributions to κ of low frequency phonon modes below the gap,
as shown in the insert of Fig. 5(d). Due to the lack of the gap in
the phonon dispersion of monolayer SnSe, the coupling between
the phonon modes will be very strong, leading to the suppression
of the anisotropy.

Scattering channel
The phonon scattering channels ruled by the conservation of en-
ergy are investigated to quantify the speciﬁc scattering processes
due to different phonon branches. Since the phonon branches
commonly degenerate or cross with each other in the most seg-

DOI: 10.1039/C6NR01349Jments of the path passing through the main high-symmetry k-
points in the IBZ as shown in Fig. 2, we only present in Fig. 6
the scattering rate of acoustic phonon modes along Γ-Y direction
where the acoustic phonon modes can be easily separated as LA,
TA and FA, and the crossover problem is ﬁxed manually. Both the
scattering rates for absorption and emission processes as shown
in Eq. (4) are addressed and the scattering rates for emission pro-
cesses are multiplied by 1/2 to avoid counting twice for the same
process. To focus on the scattering between acoustic and optical
phonon modes, the LA, TA and FA phonon branches are collected
together as "A", the 3 low frequency optical phonon branches are
collected together as "O1", and the 6 optical phonon branches
with high frequency are collected together as "O2". As discussed
above, there exists a gap between O1 and O2 for monolayer GeS
and GeSe, while the gap disappears for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
All the possible phonon scattering channels for the four
monolayer compounds are plotted in Fig. 6.
Note that the
phonon scattering channels are similar for GeSe, SnS and SnSe,
while that for GeS is different due to the lack of the scat-
tering channels of LA/TA/FA+A/O1→O2, which is resulted
from the large gap (2.014THz) between O1 and O2 for mono-
layer GeS.
The major scattering channels that have a large
contribution to the overall scattering for monolayer GeS are
LA/TA/FA+A→A, LA/TA/FA→A+A and LA+A→O1. In contrast,
the major scattering channels for monolayer GeSe, SnS and SnSe
are LA/TA/FA+A→O1. The scattering between A and O1 phonon
branches, especially for TA and FA, is highly enhanced due to
the tiny or disappeared gap for monolayer GeSe, SnS and SnSe.
Furthermore, besides LA/TA/FA+A→O1, the scattering channels
of TA/FA+O1→O1 for monolayer SnS, and the scattering chan-
nels of LA/TA/FA+O1→O2, LA+A→O2 and TA/FA+O2→O2 for
monolayer SnSe play a major role. Along with the characteristics
of their phonon dispersions as shown in Fig. 2, it can be concluded
that a large gap will result in the decoupling between acoustic and
high frequency optical phonon modes, and when the gap is tiny
or disappears, the phonon branches becomes close to each other,
which will result in their strong couplings and lead to a remark-
able scattering channel.
It is discussed above based on Fig. 5 that the phonon transport
properties of the four monolayer compounds are nearly isotropic
for high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency
(where the gap locates), which separates the phonon dispersion
into two regions containing equal numbers of branches, while
the anisotropy along the two different directions is conspicuous
for low frequency phonon modes below the separatrix frequency.
It is the phonon modes in the region below the separatrix fre-
quency that result in the anisotropy. The coupling between the
phonon branches will suppress the anisotropy of the low fre-
quency phonon modes when there is no gap. When a gap ex-
ists, the coupling will be weak, leading to the presence of the
anisotropy. If the gap is very large, the coupling disappears, re-
sulting in the appearance of the strong anisotropy of low fre-
quency phonon modes. Thus the anisotropy is huge for mono-
layer GeS, small for monolayer GeSe, while almost disappear for
monolayer SnS and SnSe.

Electron localization functions
The anisotropic behavior can also be understood from a funda-
mental view of the atomic bonding. To picture the electron pair
probability, we plot the ELF for the four monolayer compounds in
Fig. 7. The ELF contains information on the structure of atomic
shells, and also displays the location and size of bonding and lone
electron pairs.60 The ELF characterizes the probability of ﬁnding
an electron with the same spin in the neighborhood space of the
reference electron. The smaller the probability the more localized
the reference electron. The ELF is powerful in interpreting chem-
ical bonding patterns, ranging from 0 to 1,61 where 0 means no
electron, 0.5 corresponds to electron-gas-like pair probability, and
1 corresponds to perfect localization.
As revealed in Fig. 7, the ELF along the zigzag direction for
the four monolayer compounds are all larger than 0.5 (the value
of uniform electron gas), which means that the electrons are lo-
calized. The bonding makes the rigidity along zigzag direction,
while for armchair direction, the ELF are all smaller than 0.5,
which means that the electrons are delocalized. The ELF along
armchair direction is obviously the smallest for monolayer GeS,
resulting in its softest nature along the armchair direction re-
ﬂected by its smallest Young’s modulus as shown in Table. 1. The
ELF along the two directions shows a big difference for monolayer
GeS and GeSe, especially for monolayer GeS, while shows only a
small difference for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
The anisotropic
behavior of the ELF reﬂecting the bonding characteristics is the
physical origin of the diverse anisotropic properties for the series
of monolayer compounds with hinge-like orthorhombic structure.

Size effect
It is well known that, with a larger rMFP, the thermal conduc-
tivity could be modulated more effectively by nanostructuring. If
the rMFP is very small, the effect of nanostructures with a typical
size will be not signiﬁcant for the phonon transport. As listed in
Table 1, bulk SnSe has the smallest rMFP, and the four monolayer

compounds have larger rMFP than bulk SnSe, which means that
it would be more effective to modulate the phonon transport in
the monolayer compounds by nanostructuring. Furthermore, the
phonon transport in monolayer GeS and GeSe could be more ef-
fectively modulated due to their larger rMFP compared to that in
monolayer SnS and SnSe. In order to address the size effect on the
phonon transport properties, the phonon boundary scattering due
to the ﬁnite size should be considered, which can be estimated by
the standard equation:62–64

(7)
where p is the specularity parameter, which means the fraction of
specularly scattered phonons depending on the roughness of the
edge, ranging from 0 for a completely rough edge to 1 for a per-
fectly smooth edge, vλ is the phonon group velocity of the phonon
mode λ, and L is the system size usually ranging from nanome-
ters to micrometers. The temperature gradient is assumed to be
along the direction of the ﬁnite sample length. Anisotropy due to
ﬁnite sample size is ignored because of the relatively large sizes
considered.37,65 Then the scattering rate of each phonon mode is
calculated by the Matthiessen rule:

(8)
where 1/τanh
λ
is the intrinsic anharmonic scattering rates due to
phonon-phonon interactions, and 1/τiso
λ
is the scattering rate due
to isotopic impurity.
By considering a fully diffusive scattering at the boundary, i.e.,
p = 0, we plot the κ as a function of the system size as shown in
Fig. 8(a). When the size is up to near 105 nm, the κ for all the
monolayer and bulk compounds almost converge to the value of
inﬁnite system. The κ decreases with the size decreasing, and the
κ along armchair direction of monolayer GeSe has the most rapid
decrease, which is resulted from its largest rMFP of 72.51nm. It
is obvious that when the size decreases the κ will decrease faster
with a larger rMFP. It is also shown that the anisotropy of the κ is
affected by the ﬁnite size. Generally, the anisotropy will become
weak due to the limited size. The reason lies in that usually large
κ corresponds to large rMFP and small κ corresponds to small
rMFP. Thus the large κ will have a bigger decrease than small
κ with limited size, leading to the anisotropy of the κ becoming
weak at short length. Based on the κ and rMFP as listed in Ta-
ble. 1, the anisotropy of the κ will become weak for monolayer
GeS, SnSe and bulk SnSe with limited size, while the contrary is
the case for monolayer GeSe and SnS that the anisotropy of the
κ will become strong with limited size. The cases are conﬁrmed
as shown in Fig. 8(b). With limited size, the κ could be effec-
tively lowered and the anisotropy could be effectively modulated
by nanostructuring such as patterning into nanoribbon or incor-
porating pores, which would extend the applications in thermo-
electrics and thermal management. Note that the size effect stud-
ied here is estimated based on diffusive phonon transport by con-
sidering additional phonon boundary scattering. If the ballistic
phonon transport is effectively involved, the thermal conductivity
and its anisotropy might be slightly different from current results
at very small scales.66 For detailed study on the phonon transport
properties of nanostructured systems, more effective simulations
should be performed, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tion and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC).

Summary and conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the diverse
phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI com-
pounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltzmann
transport equation based on ﬁrst-principles calculations.
They
all possess rather low thermal conductivity compared to lots of
other 2D materials. The contribution from each phonon branch
is studied and its relation with the rMFP is also discussed. The
four monolayer compounds, although possessing similar hinge-
like structure along the armchair direction as phosphorene, show
diverse anisotropic properties in many aspects, such as phonon
group velocity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal conductiv-
ity (κ), etc. Especially, the κ along the zigzag and armchair di-
rections of monolayer GeS shows the strongest anisotropy while
monolayer SnS and SnSe shows an almost isotropy in phonon

A detailed analysis on the diverse anisotropic properties of the
series 2D orthorhombic compounds is presented. The anisotropy
of thermal conductivity is actually dominated by the anisotropy
of phonon group velocity. Based on the analysis of the frequency
dependent κ and average phonon group velocity, we ﬁnd that
the anisotropy is mainly introduced by the region below the gap
between the high frequency optical phonon modes and low fre-
quency phonon modes in the phonon dispersions.
The larger
the gap, the stronger the anisotropy. The inﬂuence of the gap
on the anisotropy can be explained from the coupling between
the phonon modes at both sides of the gap, which is supported
by the phonon scattering channels. The diverse anisotropic be-
havior can also be understood from a fundamental view of the
atomic bonding characterized by the ELF. The anisotropic behav-
ior of the ELF reﬂecting the bonding characteristics is the phys-
ical origin of the anisotropic properties. The phonon transport
in monolayer GeS and GeSe can be more effectively modulated
by nanostructuring due to their larger rMFP compared to that in
monolayer SnS and SnSe.
It is also shown that the anisotropy
of the κ is affected by the ﬁnite size.
With limited size, the
κ could be effectively lowered, and the anisotropy could be ef-
fectively modulated by nanostructuring, which would extend the
applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal manage-
ment. This study not only present comprehensive investigations
on the phonon transport properties of the new family of 2D or-
thorhombic group IV-VI compounds (GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe),
but also provide discussions and analysis on the origins of the di-
verse anisotropy, which enriches the understanding of nanoscale
phonon transport in 2D materials, and would be of signiﬁcance
for further study and applications in emerging technologies.
