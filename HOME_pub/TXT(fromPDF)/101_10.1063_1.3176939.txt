The nonlinear frequency shift coefﬁcient, which represents the strength of the transformation of
amplitude ﬂuctuations into phase ﬂuctuations of an oscillator, is measured for MgO-based
spin-torque oscillators by analyzing the current dependence of the power spectrum. We have
observed that linewidth against inverse normalized power plots show linear behavior below and
above the oscillation threshold as predicted by the analytical theories for spin-torque oscillators. The
magnitude of the coefﬁcient is determined from the ratio of the linear slopes. Small magnitude of
the coefﬁcient 3 has been obtained for the device exhibiting narrow linewidth 10 MHz at
high bias current. © 2009 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.3176939
Spin-torque oscillators STOs emit a microwave signal.
The signal originates in magnetization oscillations excited by
bias dc current in a magnetoresistive MR device.1,2 In re-
cent years, extensive studies have been carried out on STOs
because they are a promising candidate for an on-chip mi-
crowave oscillator.3,4 One of the important properties of an
STO is its frequency nonlinearity, i.e., a frequency depends
on an oscillation amplitude.5,6 Due to the property, the fre-
quency of STO is tunable only by changing bias dc current,
which is generally considered to be an advantage for appli-
cations. The nonlinearity is, however, a disadvantage of STO
when thermal ﬂuctuations are taken into account. According
to the analytical theory of Kim et al.,7 amplitude ﬂuctuations
are transformed into phase ﬂuctuations because of the non-
linearity, resulting in spectrum linewidth broadening. The
linewidth is a measure of the phase stability of oscillation
and it is preferable that it be narrow. Estimating quantita-
tively the nonlinearity, which determines the device perfor-
mances, is therefore a key subject for further developments
of STOs. According to the recent theories,7–12 the quantity
representing the degree of the nonlinearity is the normalized
dimensionless nonlinear frequency shift coefﬁcient  re-
garding the deﬁnition of the coefﬁcient, see, e.g., Eq. 7 of
Ref. 10 or Eq. 9 of Ref. 11. In this letter, we report ex-
perimental estimations of the coefﬁcient  in MgO-based
STOs near threshold, which have not been directly addressed
by previous experiments. Following some theoretical re-
marks, experimental results are shown.
It is theoretically known that the coefﬁcient  has vari-
ous
values
depending
on
magnetic
environments
and
damping.10–12 In general, the coefﬁcient  also depends on
bias current.10,12 Considering that the variation of  with bias
current is small in the range near threshold, we treat  as a
constant independent of bias current.
First, we demonstrate numerically how large the coefﬁ-
cient  is in typical STOs. A calculation example of  at the
threshold in a planar device with uniaxial anisotropy is
shown in Fig. 1, representing the dependence on the magni-
tude and the angle of an in-plane external magnetic ﬁeld. The
calculation is performed by the method described in Ref. 11
which is based on the macrospin model. We have used the
typical STO parameters shown in the ﬁgure caption. In the
notation used here, positive  denotes a frequency red shift
with a bias current, i.e., the frequency of STO decreases with
the current when  is positive, and negative  denotes a
frequency blue shift. In the wide external ﬁeld region,  is
much larger than unity 5–50. On the black line shown
in Fig. 1, the frequency nonlinearity vanishes the nonlinear-
ity due to the demagnetizing effect cancels out that due to the
in-plane anisotropy, where remarkable reduction of line-
width is expected.12,14,15
To estimate the value of  from experiment, we have
used the spectrum analysis method based on the theories of
spectrum linewidth of STO under thermal ﬂuctuations.7–12
The method is similar to the one often used to measure the
linewidth enhancement factor -factor in lasers.16 Accord-
ing to the theories, the linewidth shows asymptotic behavior
below and above threshold. In the region below threshold
the thermal activated oscillation region, the linewidth is

1
In the region above threshold the current-induced oscillation
region, the linewidth is given by
f = f0  kBT/Eosci  1 + 2/2,
2
in which the additional phase diffusion due to amplitude
ﬂuctuations is expressed by the factor of 2. In Eqs. 1 and
2, f0 is the damping at thermal equilibrium expressed in
linewidth, kBT is the thermal energy, and Eosci is the average
magnetization oscillating energy of a certain oscillation
mode. The energy Eosci becomes large as the bias current I
increases. Since the voltage oscillation signal from STO
originates in the MR effect, Eosci is proportional to a ‘nor-
malized’ power P/I2, where P is the power of voltage oscil-
lation signal from STO. Therefore, Eqs. 1 and 2 both
indicate that the linewidth is proportional to the inverse nor-
malized power in the two asymptotic regions, i.e., f,
	P/I2−1. Accordingly, drawing a linewidth versus inverse
normalized power plot, we can extract  from the following
relation:
s/s = 1 + 2/2,
3
where s and s are the slopes of asymptotes below and
above threshold, respectively. To visualize Eq. 3, we show
the linewidth and inverse power calculated numerically in
Fig. 2. The calculation is based on the Fokker–Planck
equation
FPE
corresponding
to
a
noisy
nonlinear
autooscillator.9,17 We have used the single-Lorentzian ap-
proximation for a power spectrum. In the approximation, the
linewidth is given by the real part of the ﬁrst eigenvalue in
the eigenmode expansion method for FPE Re 
1,1 in the
notation of Ref. 9. In Fig. 2, linewidths show asymptotic
behavior dotted lines represented by Eqs. 1 and 2 in the
region below and above threshold, and the relation between
the slopes of asymptotes Eq. 3 holds.
Measurements are performed on MgO-based planar
magnetic tunnel junction devices at room temperature. Tun-
nel junctions are composed of IrMn10/pinned layer PL/
MgO1.05/free layer FL, in which the FL is a CoFeB3
layer and the PL is a CoFe4/Ru0.95/CoFeB4 synthetic
antiferromagnet trilayer. The junctions have been fabricated
by sputter deposition with annealing for 1 h in a high mag-
netic ﬁeld and at the temperature of 300 °C. Nanopillar de-
vices are patterned using electron-beam lithography and ion
milling. On the same wafer, we ﬁnd samples with various
tunnel magnetoresistance TMR ratio in the range 10%–
90%. We have observed that lower TMR ratio samples tend
to show narrower spectral linewidth oscillations. This ten-
dency in MgO-based samples is similar to that reported in
Ref. 18. We consider that the difference of TMR ratio among
samples may result from localized defects in the MgO barrier
as speculated by the authors of Ref. 18. In this letter, we
show the results of one typical low TMR ratio sample with a
200120 nm2 elliptical shape. From R-H resistance-ﬁeld
characteristic measurements of the sample for several ﬁeld
angles, we ﬁnd that the resistance is 235  5.6  m2 for
parallel conﬁguration, TMR ratio is 15.6%, and an in-plane
anisotropy ﬁeld Hk is about 200 Oe. The PL magnetization is
along the long axis of the ellipse without an applied ﬁeld.
Oscillation properties are measured by a spectrum ana-
lyzer. We apply dc current I to the sample with antiparallel
magnetization conﬁguration. Positive I corresponds to elec-
trons ﬂowing from the PL to the FL. Oscillation properties
vary sensitively with the ﬁeld applied in the sample plane:
the magnitude H of 200–700 Oe and the angle H of
0° –90°. When the angle H40° 5° and the magnitude
H50050 Oe, distinct oscillation peaks are observed. In
the other applied ﬁelds, distinct peaks are not observed at
any bias current I0.7 mA. Below, we show the results
for the two setups of the applied ﬁelds in which narrow line-
widths of 10 MHz are observed: I H=490 Oe and H
=42.4°, and II H=516 Oe and H=39.7°.
Power spectral density PSD of the voltage oscillation
signal in the setup I is shown in Fig. 3. The characteristic
oscillation mode is observed around 7.2 GHz for the bias
current I0.42 mA. This mode grows steeply as the bias
current increases and exhibits narrow linewidth in the high-
current region. The PSD in the setup II is similar to that in
the setup I. The dependence of the frequency, the full width
at half maximum FWHM linewidth, and the normalized
power of the mode on the bias current for the setups I and
II is shown in Fig. 4. The data are obtained by Lorentzian
ﬁts to the spectral peaks of the characteristic oscillation
modes. The broken lines in Fig. 4 denote the threshold cur-
rents Ith. The normalized power below threshold depends on
the bias current in the way that P/I2−1	Ith−I.8 By using
the expression, we ﬁnd that Ith0.46 mA for the setup I
and Ith0.44 mA for the setup II. In Figs. 4a and 4d,
the frequency shift with the bias current is much smaller than
that observed in previous experiments for MgO-based
STOs,18,19 and we cannot judge whether the shift is red or

134.129.164.186 On: Sun, 21 Dec 2014 19:40:01blue. In Figs. 4c and 4f, the normalized power grows
steeply up to the current I0.52 mA from the threshold
current. For I0.52 mA, the normalized power is being
saturated.
From the data for linewidth f and normalized power
P/I2 shown in Fig. 4, we have obtained the f versus
P/I2−1 plots shown in Fig. 5. We have used the data for the
current I0.52 mA. As predicted by the theories, we ob-
serve that linewidth against inverse normalized power plots
show linear behavior below and above the threshold. The
appearance of the linear behavior above the threshold sup-
ports the consideration that the variation of  with bias cur-
rent is small in the range near threshold. By estimating the
values of linear slopes s, and using Eq. 3, we ﬁnd the
coefﬁcient 2.9 for the setup I and 2.6 for the
setup II. Considering the range of values expected by the
calculation as shown in Fig. 1, these values of the coefﬁcient
3 are comparatively small. The smallness is consistent
with the ﬂatness of frequency Figs. 4a and 4d and the
exhibition of narrow linewidths of 10 MHz in the high-
current region Figs. 4b and 4e. According to Fig. 1, the
coefﬁcient  is expected to have small values when an in-
plane ﬁeld is applied to the hard axis, i.e., H80° –90°.
Our results measured in the angle of H40° are inconsis-
tent with the expectation. We consider that the mode with 7.2
GHz peak may be a nonuniform mode and so the effective
directions and structures of in-plane anisotropy for the mag-
netization composing the mode are complicated. Micromag-
netic study to clarify the oscillation mode is now in progress.
In summary, we estimated the coefﬁcient  in MgO-
based STOs which is a measure of the transformation of
amplitude ﬂuctuations into phase ﬂuctuations of an oscilla-
tor.
