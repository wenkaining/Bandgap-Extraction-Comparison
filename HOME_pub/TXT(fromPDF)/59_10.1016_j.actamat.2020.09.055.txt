Contemporary powder-based polycrystalline nickel-base superalloys inherit microstructures and proper- 
ties that are heavily determined by their thermo-mechanical treatments during processing. Here, the 
inﬂuence of a thermal exposure to an alloy powder is studied to elucidate the controlling formation 
mechanisms of the strengthening precipitates using a combination of atom probe tomography and in- 
situ neutron diffraction. The initial powder comprised a single-phase supersaturated γ only; from this, 
the evolution of γ ′ volume fraction and lattice misﬁt was assessed. The initial powder notably possessed 
elemental segregation of Cr and Co and elemental repulsion between Ni, Al and Ti with Cr; here proposed 
to be a precursor for subsequent γ to γ ′ phase transformations. Subsolvus heat treatments yielded a uni- 
modal γ ′ distribution, formed during heating, with evidence supporting its formation to be via spinodal 
decomposition. A supersolvus heat treatment led to the formation of this same γ ′ population during 
heating, but dissolves as the temperature increases further. The γ ′ then reprecipitates as a multimodal 
population during cooling, here forming by classical nucleation and growth. Atom probe characterisation 
provided intriguing precipitate characteristics, including clear differences in chemistry and microstruc- 
ture, depending on whether the γ ′ formed during heating or cooling.

1. Introduction 
Understanding formation reactions and evolution behaviour of 
ordered second phase precipitates is technologically critical for a 
compendium of applications; these are most pertinent for multi- 
component alloys used for structural applications. This is acutely 
important for nickel-base superalloys, the material of choice for the 
hottest sections of a gas turbine engines. These alloys are designed 
with judicious elemental selection to confer a balance between 
high temperature mechanical performance, thermodynamic stabil- 
ity and corrosion resistance required for long-term use in an ag- 
gressive in-service environment [1,2] . The chosen multi-component

Kontis). 
compositions lead to complex microstructures and phase trans- 
formation behaviour; understanding the governing mechanisms is 
most critical for the selection of optimal processing parameters [3] . 
Modern nickel-base superalloy turbine discs are fabricated from 
powders, a cost-effective processing route developed to give a 
step-change improvement in component performance through im- 
proved alloy homogeneity and a ﬁner grain size over traditional 
cast and wrought processing methods [4,5] . As there are several 
stages in the alloy/component manufacture, there is active research 
in understanding and optimising the microstructure of each pro- 
cessing method used. This includes hot isostatic pressing (HIP) 
e.g. [6] , thermomechanical processing e.g. [7] and heat treatments 
e.g. [8] . It is notable that the majority of our understanding of mi- 
crostructural control is derived from the ﬁnal heat treatment ﬁnal 
stage. The approach, however, has a clear weakness as it inhibits

any understanding of γ → γ ′ reaction behaviour during the early 
stages of processing. 
In polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy derivatives, the multi- 
phase microstructure comprises an A1 structure γ matrix and a 
dispersion of ordered, coherent L1 2 structure γ ′ precipitates with 
a low lattice misﬁt. The formation of γ ′ precipitates has been stud- 
ied extensively in systems of varying compositional complexity, fo- 
cusing on how the precipitates nucleate and grow. This has in- 
cluded binary Ni-Al [9,10] , ternary Ni-Al-Cr [11] , Ni-Al-Ti [12] and 
multicomponent systems [13–17] . Model systems have low super- 
saturation, making it possible to suppress γ ′ formation, then ob- 
serve γ ′ forming via isothermal heat treatments. These studies in- 
dicate γ ′ forms by classical nucleation. However, studying γ ′ for- 
mation behaviour in multicomponent systems, such as those used 
in a commercial powder metallurgy (PM) nickel-base superalloy, 
contain higher concentration of γ ′ forming elements, making it 
impossible to suppress their formation during cooling tests due 
to the high driving force for γ ′ formation [18] . In this case, in- 
stead of classical nucleation, some authors have speculated that 
γ ′ forms via spinodal decomposition during the early stages. Tan 
et al. [19] showed evidence of interconnected networks of γ ′ with 
diffuse interfaces and compositions far from equilibrium, observed 
following fast quenching. These results here were indicative that 
chemical ordering can occur concurrently to spinodal decomposi- 
tion. 
In order to investigate whether the formation of γ ′ occurs by 
the classical nucleation mechanism or spinodal decomposition, we 
have studied the microstructural evolution of γ ′ from a highly 
supersaturated γ phase in a nickel-base superalloy powder. The 
nature of powder production sees individual particles solidify ex- 
ceptionally quickly, where they are subjected to cooling rates far 
greater than would be possible in bulk samples, simply by virtue of 
the heat transfer limitations from the signiﬁcant volume difference. 
Hence, the cooling rate during powder production is hypothesised 
to be suﬃciently rapid to entirely suppress the γ ′ formation, even 
in a highly alloyed superalloy derivative with high concentrations 
of γ ′ forming elements. 
In this study we have exposed a nickel-base superalloy pow- 
der to thermal cycles that reach temperatures above and below the 
γ ′ solvus temperature whilst acquiring neutron diffraction data in- 
situ. Our results reveal that γ ′ not only forms during cooling but 
also during heating via spinodal decomposition. Furthermore, de- 
pending on the heat treatment temperature, the distribution and 
morphology of γ ′ precipitates alters from an interconnected net- 
work of precipitates, to a unimodal distribution and ﬁnally to a 
multimodal precipitate distribution. Understanding the precipitate 
formation sequence is supported by atom probe tomography mea- 
surements which ascertain characteristic compositional differences 
as a function of the prescribed subsolvus or supersolvus heat treat- 
ment. 
2. Method 
2.1. Material 
Powder of the commercial nickel-base superalloy RR10 0 0 
was produced by gas atomisation with the following nomi- 
nal composition (wt.%): Ni-15Cr-18.5Co-5Mo-3Al-3.6Ti-2Ta-0.5Hf- 
0.06Zr-0.027C-0.015B . 
2.2. Neutron diffraction 
Diffraction data were collected on the ENGIN-X instrument at 
the ISIS neutron spallation source, UK. A setup of the experiment 
is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . The beamline was equipped with 
Fig. 1. Diagrammatic experimental setup on ENGIN-X instrument, adapted from 
Collins et al. [25] . 
a vacuum furnace suitable for in-situ heating experiments. An in- 
cident neutron beam illuminated a probed volume in the sample 
measuring approximately 8 × 8 × 8 mm 3 , determined by the cross- 
section size of the incident mean and the collimators. The diffrac- 
tion signal was measured from two detectors, both orthogonal to 
the incident beam, arriving from diffraction vectors parallel to the 
radial direction of the cylindrical sample (labelled q north and q south 
in Fig. 1 ). Further instrument details are available elsewhere [20] . 
Cylindrical alumina crucibles (12 mm outer diameter, 9.5 mm 
inner diameter ×
14 mm high) were ﬁlled with alloy pow- 
der and inserted into vanadium cans before being placed into 
the beam line furnace. Sample temperatures were monitored us- 
ing R-type thermocouples, placed in contact with the crucibles. 
Three thermal cycles were examined, with samples reaching (i) 
900 ◦C, (ii) 1000 ◦C and (iii) 1150 ◦C. Samples were heated at 
20 ◦C min −1 , held at the target temperature for 15 min, then 
cooled at 20 ◦C min −1 . The data acquisition time was 1.5 min per 
diffraction pattern. 
2.3. Diffraction data analysis 
From the set of diffraction patterns acquired from the time- 
of-ﬂight measurements, γ / γ ′ volume fraction, lattice parameter 
and lattice misﬁt were calculated. These parameters were obtained 
from the following analysis procedure, here applied to each indi- 
vidual diffraction pattern. 
The γ ′ volume faction was found by summing the inte- 
grated intensities of several γ ′ superlattice reﬂections, comprising 
{ 011 } γ ’ , { 012 } γ ’ and { 112 } γ ’ . Numerical integration was conducted 
via a simple trapezium rule for each reﬂection across a peak width 
of 0.2 ˚A. As the (01 ¯4 ) α and (116) α reﬂections lie in close proximity 
to the { 011 } γ ’ and { 012 } γ ’ reﬂections, a contribution of their sig- 
nals was included in the numerical integration. As it was known 
that there was no γ ′ present at t = 0 (see APT results later) and 
no separate superlattice reﬂection contribution could be detected, 
the intensity associated with the alumina could be subtracted. This 
provides the temporal integrated γ ′ intensity, I γ ′ 
hkl (t) for a super- 
lattice reﬂection hkl . At the end of the experiment, at t = t end , the 
equilibrium γ ′ volume fraction, φeq , was reached. This temporal 
volume fraction, φγ ′ (t) , could then be approximated by: 
φγ ′ (t) = 
I γ ′ 
hkl (t) 
I γ ′ 
hkl (t = t end ) φγ ′ 
eq 
(1) 
The γ ′ lattice parameter was obtained by ﬁtting the { 112 } γ ’ 
reﬂection with a Gaussian function to obtain its d -spacing, d 112 . 
Assuming a powder average, the lattice parameter was given by 
a γ ′ = d γ ′ 
112 
√ 
N , where N = 6 for the {112} reﬂection. The γ lattice 
parameter was obtained by ﬁtting a fundamental reﬂection associ- 
ated with this phase. As the lattice parameters of the γ and γ ′ 
phases are near identical, their fundamental reﬂections overlap, 
necessitating separation of their independent intensity contribu- 
tions. The procedure utilised here is developed from prior studies 
of nickel-base superalloys [21–25] .D.M. Collins, N. D’Souza, C. Panwisawas et al. / Acta Materialia 200 (2020) 959–970

For a fundamental reﬂection, as reﬂections overlap, the ob- 
served intensity proﬁle as a function of d -spacing, d , denoted as 
I γ + γ ′ 
hkl (d) , can be approximated by the sum of two Gaussian func- 
tions as: 
I γ + γ ′

where I γ ′ 
0 & I γ
0 are amplitude scaling constants, d γ ′ 
0 & d γ
0 are the 
mean peak positions, corresponding to the planar d -spacing for 
each respective phase and hkl , βγ ’ & βγ determine proﬁle breadth 
and I bkg is the uniform background intensity. 
Due to the high number of free ﬁtting variables in Eq. (2) , ob- 
taining a numerically stable ﬁtted solution using this formulation 
is near impossible. This is owing to the near identical d -spacings 
of the γ and γ ′ phases. Some of the variables can, however, be 
ﬁxed, using information associated with the γ ′ phase already ob- 
tained from the superlattice reﬂections. Firstly, d γ ′ 
0 can be inferred 
from a γ ’ . In this data analysis, the {200} reﬂection was used, hence 
d γ ′ 
0 = a γ ′ / 2 . As the ENGIN-X yields diffraction line proﬁles which 
are largely dominated by instrumental and geometric factors, it can 
be assumed that the contribution of line broadening from the sam- 
ple is small, hence the line proﬁles for the γ and γ ′ phases are 
assumed equal and so βγ ’ = βγ . The ﬁnal assumption is that the 
ratio of integrated intensities of the γ and γ ′ reﬂections can be 
related to the phase volume fractions and structure factors via

hkl and I γ ′ 
hkl are the integrated intensities of the γ and γ ′ 
reﬂection, respectively, with miller indices hkl . | F γ
hkl | and | F γ ′ 
hkl | are 
the γ & γ ′ structure factors and φγ & φγ ’ are the γ & γ ′ vol- 
ume fractions. Eq. (3) holds for fundamental reﬂections γ & γ ′ 
reﬂections of equal hkl , where their d -spacings are similar. Using 
the measured φγ ’ from the ﬁtted superlattice reﬂections, it follows 
φγ (t) = 1 −φγ ′ (t) , assuming only γ and γ ′ phases are present. 
Structure factors for the γ and γ ′ phases were calculated for 
their A1 and L1 2 crystal structures. Composition predictions as 
a function of temperature were calculated with the Thermo-Calc 
[26] software using the Thermotech TCNI6 thermodynamic database 
[27] . All phases other than γ and γ ′ were suspended in these cal- 
culations. The calculation for the γ and γ ′ structure factors are 
described in detail elsewhere [24] , as well as site occupancies for 
alloy RR10 0 0 [28] . These composition predictions were also used 
to calculate the equilibrium γ ′ volume fraction, φeq , of 0.46 as re- 
quired for Eq. (1) ; this value is in close agreement to independent 
measurements of the RR10 0 0 alloy [29] . 
The use of a Gaussian line proﬁle enables use of its analytical 
solution for its integrated intensity:

Rearranging for I γ

This function was incorporated into the ﬁtting function, Eq. (2) , 
when ﬁtting a γ / γ ′ fundamental reﬂection. Once d γ
0 was obtained 
and a γ was calculated, the lattice misﬁt, δ, was obtained for each 
diffraction measurement using the expression: 
δ = 2 a γ ′ −a γ
a γ ′ + a γ

2.4. TEM characterisation 
Powders were mounted in conductive Bakelite and polished us- 
ing conventional metallographic preparation procedures with an 
extended ﬁnal colloidal silica stage to minimise preparation in- 
duced deformation on the surface. Samples for Transmission Elec- 
tron Microscope (TEM) analysis were prepared using a FEI Versa 
3D dual beam a system combining Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) and a 
Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM). Sam- 
ples were extracted from within a single powder particle using a 
standard in-situ liftout procedure, however, great care was taken 
to ensure that the thickness of the samples was homogeneous 
and similar for all samples. The composition of the phases within 
a powder particle were measured using a FEI Talos F200X Field 
Emission Gun (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscope (FEG- 
(S)TEM) equipped with a Super X energy dispersive spectroscopy 
(EDS) system. Chemical distribution spectra maps were collected 
using EDS in STEM mode and quantiﬁcation was performed from 
reconstructing areas within the maps from multiple areas where 
there was no/minimal apparent overlap between the phases using 
Velox software. 
Further TEM characterisation was conducted where diffraction 
contrast microscopy was used to produce electron diffraction and 
dark-ﬁeld images. Here, a liftout procedure was used to prepare a 
TEM foil using an FEI Helios G4 CX FIB operated at 30 kV. A low, 
5 kV, ion beam was used for surface cleaning for a period of 2 min 
on each side of the TEM samples in order to remove the outer layer 
of the specimens affected by FIB beam damage. The specimen was 
observed using a FEI Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV. 
2.5. Atom probe tomography 
To obtain three-dimensional compositional information of the 
γ and γ ′ microstructure, samples were prepared for atom probe 
tomography (APT) via a site speciﬁc lift out method (described in 
[30] ) using an FEI Dual Beam FIB Helios 600i. Samples from the 
initial powder and from samples heat treated in the beam line ex- 
periments (these samples had 900 ◦C, 10 0 0 ◦C and 1150 ◦C ther- 
mal exposures) were characterised. The specimens were extracted 
from random sites within each sample. The APT measurements 
were conducted using a Cameca LEAP 30 0 0 HR instrument, oper- 
ated with a pulsed laser at 200 kHz, with a pulse energy of 0.4 nJ 
and at a temperature of 60 K. Data reconstruction and subsequent 
analysis was performed using the software IVAS 3.8.2 . 
3. Results 
3.1. Starting powder 
A secondary electron micrograph of the starting alloy powder 
is shown in Fig. 2 indicating the spherical morphology of the in- 
dividual powder particles and a distribution of diameters, approx- 
imately in the range 2–15 μm. Atom probe tomography measure- 
ments were made on the starting powder; composition measure- 
ments from 3 different samples, each taken from the same pow- 
der particle, are shown in Table 1 . The composition was approxi- 
mately uniform within each specimen without showing any signif- 
icant variations. 
The occurrence of a compositional segregation that can be the 
precursor of phase separation was investigated in the initial pow- 
der. An APT reconstruction from the initial powder is shown in 
Fig. 3 alongside its corresponding frequency distribution analysis.962

tribution analysis of Ni, Cr, Al and Ti for the same data. 
In particular, the corresponding binomial, i.e. random, distribution 
is plotted to allow for comparison with the experimental distribu- 
tion of the elements: Ni, Cr, Al and Ti. In the case of Ni, the ex- 
perimental distribution does not follow the binomial distribution, 
indicating that Ni is not arranged completely randomly. This was 
further conﬁrmed by the Pearson coeﬃcient, μ, which is given in 
Table 2 , that can be used to reveal statistical deviation from ran- 
domness. The Pearson coeﬃcient is indicated with values between 
0 and 1, where 0 represents a random distribution and 1 reveals a 
statistical compositional segregation [31] . From Table 2 , an obvious 
deviation from a random distribution is observed in the case of Ni 
and Cr, whereas the distribution of Ti and Al is closer to random.

Fig. 4. Experimental bulk normalised concentration radial distribution functions 
(RDFs) of Cr with Co, Ti, Ni, Cr and Al indicating a compositional segregation in 
the initial powder. 
In addition, radial distribution functions (RDF) were calculated 
from the APT data, in order to conﬁrm a compositional segrega- 
tion. In this case, each neighbourhood solute surrounding a spe- 
ciﬁc species is examined and an average composition of each so- 
lute as a function of the radial distance to this particular species 
is calculated [32–34] ). Fig. 4 shows the RDF of Cr with Co, Ti, Ni, 
Cr and Al indicating a compositional segregation. In particular, the 
Cr-Cr and Cr-Co RDFs exhibit similar behaviour indicating that Cr 
and Co atoms tend to prefer to segregate together, creating regions 
of high Cr/Co content. In contrast, Ni, Al and Ti atoms appear re- 
pelled by the Cr atoms, resulting in regions enriched in γ ′ form- 
ing elements. In contrast, regions enriched in γ ′ forming elements 
appear to form, as indicated by the concurrent segregation of Ni, 
Al and Ti atoms. Similar observations of such compositional sepa- 
ration were performed before in a Ni-5.2Al-14.2Cr (at.%) alloy [33] , 
whereas spinodal decomposition based on RDF analysis was shown 
recently in binary Fe-Cr alloys [35,36] .D.M. Collins, N. D’Souza, C. Panwisawas et al. / Acta Materialia 200 (2020) 959–970

the α planes are from the alumina crucible and γ / γ ′ are from the matrix & precipitation phase of the powder nickel-base superalloy. 
3.2. In-situ neutron diffraction 
The alloy powder was heated in-situ whilst collecting diffrac- 
tion data. Samples heated to 900 ◦C, 10 0 0 ◦C and 1150 ◦C have 
their respective thermocouple data shown in Fig. 5 a–c, and the cor- 
responding temporal diffraction intensity shown in Fig. 5 d–f. The 
intensity data shows labels of the most intense reﬂections from the 
alloy ( γ and γ ′ ) and the alumina crucible ( α). 
The analysed diffraction data results are shown in Fig 6 which 
contain temporally resolved measurements of γ ′ volume fraction, 
γ & γ ′ lattice parameter and their corresponding lattice misﬁt. The 
key features of the differing responses for each sample will be de- 
scribed here in turn. 
For the sample heated to 900 ◦C, as the powder temperature 
increases, the γ ′ volume fraction remains at zero until ∼700 ◦C. 
The values have been determined by tracking the evolution of γ ′ 
superlattice reﬂections, giving a measure of phase ordering (and 
not composition localisation). Evidence of γ ′ forming is clear above 
this temperature as its volume fraction increases; reaching ∼0.25 
once 900 ◦C is reached. With the short isothermal hold, the vol- 
ume fraction continues to increase, reaching approximately the 
equilibrium volume fraction ( ∼0.46 as calculated by Thermo-Calc ) 
prior to cooling. The volume fraction does not change during cool- 
ing. The resulting γ ′ following the thermal cycle had formed dur- 
ing the heating and isothermal hold period only. No additional γ ′ 
formed during cooling is evident. 
During heating to 10 0 0 ◦C, the γ ′ begins to form at ∼700 ◦C 
(replicating the observation when heated to 900 ◦C). As the tem- 
perature passes 900 ◦C during heating, the γ ′ volume fraction 
drops slightly, from ∼0.25 to ∼0.2 and remains at this value un- 
til the end of the isothermal hold at 10 0 0 ◦C. As the sample cools, 
the γ ′ volume fraction was seen to increase, reaching an approx- 
imately equilibrium volume fraction as the temperature drops be- 
low ∼500 ◦C. It is unambiguously clear that the γ ′ remaining after 
the thermal cycling comprised γ ′ formed both during heating and 
cooling. 
A ﬁnal sample was heated to the 1150 ◦C, which is above the 
γ ′ solvus temperature. The γ ′ phase forms during heating, as ob- 
served in the prior heating studies, then dissolves as the temper- 
ature approaches the solvus temperature. When the solution heat 
treatment temperature is reached, only the γ phase is present. As 
the alloy is cooled, the intensity corresponding to the γ ′ refec- 
tions increases until an equilibrium volume fraction is reached by 
∼500 ◦C. The γ ′ phase present at room temperature in this sam-964

The γ / γ ′ lattice parameters and corresponding lattice misﬁt 
measurements for the three heat treatment conditions is shown 
in Fig. 6 (g-l). For all tests, when the volume fraction of γ ′ is low 
( < 0.1) there is considerable scatter in the lattice misﬁt and γ ′ lat- 
tice parameter measurements due to uncertainty from ﬁtting the 
weak { 112 } γ ’ superlattice reﬂection; these values have therefore 
been eliminated from the results. For precipitates formed during 
heating, for 900 ◦C and 1000 ◦C samples, as shown in Fig. 6 (j) and 
(k), the lattice misﬁt was positive, whereas the formation of pre- 
cipitates during cooling from 1150 ◦C, Fig. 6 (l) possessed a negative 
lattice misﬁt, which approaches zero at ∼700 ◦C. 
3.3. Post mortem characterisation 
3.3.1. Electron microscopy 
TEM characterisation of the powders exposed to subsolvus γ ′ 
temperatures were observed post mortem, as shown in Fig. 7 , with 
a HAADF image after 900 ◦C ( Fig. 7 a) after 10 0 0 ◦C exposure 
( Fig. 7 b). Neither sample was observed to have primary γ ′ present 
at the grain boundaries. The dashed box in each HAADF image rep- 
resents the composition maps for each respective sample in Fig. 7 . 
Cr and Ti are shown as examples of γ and γ ′ rich elements, re- 
spectively, to illustrate the size and distribution of these phases. 
The composition maps after 900 ◦C, show evidence of locally rich 
Ti regions, depleted of Cr, however, observing the microstructure 
here is resolution limited with features appearing diffuse. As a re- 
sult, the morphology of individual γ ′ precipitates is diﬃcult to de- 
termine using this characterisation method. 
To ascertain whether the γ ′ precipitates could be better deter- 
mined using diffraction contrast microscopy, this sample was ob- 
served using bright and dark ﬁeld imaging modes. A bright ﬁeld 
(BF) image of the 900 ◦C annealed sample is shown in Fig. 8 a, the 
region highlighted as ‘DIFF’ corresponds the region where the elec- 
tron diffraction pattern ( Fig. 8 b) was acquired. Using a [112] zone 
axis corresponding to a superlattice (112) plane, a high magniﬁ- 
cation DF image shown in Fig. 8 d and corresponding bright ﬁeldD.M. Collins, N. D’Souza, C. Panwisawas et al. / Acta Materialia 200 (2020) 959–970

Fig. 8 c images were produced to reveal contrast between the γ
and γ ′ phases. The dark/bright contrast shows clear evidence of 
regions of different γ and γ ′ crystallographic structures present in 
this sample. Referring to the DF image, a morphologically complex 
network of γ ′ precipitates can be seen. This includes evidence of 
narrow necked regions (identiﬁed with arrows), appearing bright 
to denote an L1 2 γ ′ crystal structure, that connect neighbouring 
γ ′ precipitates. Some of the γ ′ features are diﬃcult to distinguish, 
this is because the signal is integrated through the thickness of 
the TEM sample of a rather complex 3D interconnected γ ′ net- 
work and results in several γ ′ features superimposed, that cannot 
be individually distinguished. Furthermore, the blurring of the γ ′ is 
partly due to the TEM resolution limit, however, it is also possible 
that the γ / γ ′ interface does not possess a sharp A1/L1 2 structure 
transition. 
Inspection of the sample subjected to the 10 0 0 ◦C anneal shows 
a population of approximately spherical γ ′ precipitates can be seen 
(by Cr depleted regions, Fig. 7 d and Ti rich regions, Fig. 7 f), appear- 
ing as a unimodal size distribution of ∼40 nm diameter. 
The sample subjected to a thermal cycle up to 1150 ◦C was 
examined post-mortem with a scanning electron microscope; a 
backscattered electron (BSE) micrograph reveals a multimodal γ ′ 
distribution as shown in Fig. 9 . Secondary γ ′ precipitates with an 
octodentric morphology can be seen with a size of several hundred 
nanometers. In between the secondary γ ′ precipitates there is a 
much ﬁner distribution ( < 50 nm) of spherical tertiary γ ′ precipi- 
tates. There is also evidence of a depleted γ ′ zone in the γ matrix 
in regions close to the secondary γ ′ interface. These observations 
are near identical to the microstructure observed in fully processed 
RR10 0 0 subjected to a supersolvus heat treatment followed by a 
slow cool (1 ◦C min −1 ) [37] . 
From HAADF-STEM, STEM-EDS and APT characterisation results 
presented in the associated manuscript, this sample comprised γ
and γ ′ phases with interconnected networks of γ ′ precipitates, 
which was inferred by inspection/reconstruction of the chemical 
composition spacial distributions. By conducting diffraction con- 
trast spectroscopy, the observed microstructure can be related to 
the crystallography of these phases. 
3.3.2. Atom probe tomography 
The composition of the γ ′ precipitates formed at 900 ◦C, 
10 0 0 ◦C and 1150 ◦C was measured by APT. Fig. 10 shows sections 
from two APT reconstructions from the powder exposed at 900 ◦C 
for 15 min. For both datasets, clear interfaces between γ ′ precip- 
itates and γ matrix can be seen. However, the γ ′ precipitates ex- 
hibit a rather complex morphology. In particular, the γ ′ precipi- 
tates appear to be interconnected and have irregular shape, corrob- 
orating the observations made with TEM ( Fig. 8 ). Such morphol-966

ogy was observed previously for γ ′ precipitates formed by spin- 
odal decomposition during cooling [19] . We have presented only 
sections of the 3D-reconstructions in order to reveal the complex 
microstructure. The composition of the γ ′ precipitates and the γ
matrix regions as measured by APT are shown in Table 3 . Although, 
the composition of the γ ′ particles formed during heating is rela- 
tively constant, the composition of the γ matrix shows some vari- 
ations particularly in the case of Al, Ti and Co. 
Fig. 11 shows two APT reconstructions from the powder ex- 
posed at 10 0 0 ◦C for 15 min. The morphology of the γ ′ precipitates 
is different com pared to that after 15 min at 900 ◦C. In particular, 
the γ ′ precipitates are not interconnected and this is consistent 
with the TEM observations in Fig. 7 . In Table 4 , the composition 
of the γ ′ precipitates and the γ matrix is given, as measured by 
APT. No particular variation across the compositions is observed. 
However, the composition of the γ ′ precipitates and the γ matrix 
measured at 10 0 0 ◦C shows some variation when compared to that 
of 900 ◦C. 
Fig. 12 shows APT 3D-reconstructions from the powder exposed 
at 1150 ◦C for 15 min. In particular, in Fig. 12 a the reconstruction 
contains secondary γ ′ precipitates, γ matrix and tertiary γ ′ pre- 
cipitates. The tertiary γ ′ precipitates are denoted as γ ′ 
I (type I). 
Regions depleted of tertiary γ ′ precipitates in the vicinity of the 
secondary γ ′ precipitates can also be observed. In Fig. 12 b, the

Fig. 12. a) and b) APT reconstructions from the RR10 0 0 powder exposed at 1150 ◦C 
for 15 min, showing secondary and tertiary γ ′ precipitates with an isosurface at 
18.00 and 19.50 at.% Cr, respectively. 
APT reconstruction contains a part of a secondary γ ′ precipitate 
and tertiary γ ′ precipitates. In this case, two different populations 
of tertiary γ ′ precipitates can be observed based on their size. In 
particular, γ ′ 
I tertiary precipitates neighbour a depleted zone of γ ′ 
precipitates, similar to those seen in Fig. 12 a. At larger distances 
from the depleted region, the tertiary γ ′ precipitates with rela- 
tively larger size than those of γ ′ 
I can be observed. Those tertiary 
precipitates are denoted as γ ′ 
II (type II) tertiary precipitates. Pre- 
cise quantitative information on the size of the tertiary precipi- 
tates cannot be extracted by the APT reconstructions, because the 
reconstructions are not based on crystallographic information that 
would allow that. Thus, the information on the size of the tertiary 
precipitates is only qualitative. 
The two different populations of tertiary precipitates have also 
signiﬁcant variations in terms of chemistry as it is shown in Fig. 13 . 
The composition of the tertiary γ ′ 
II precipitates in this graph is the 
average of the four precipitates shown in Fig. 12 b, whereas the 
composition of the tertiary γ ′ 
I is the average of ten precipitates. 
Substantial differences can be seen for all elements between the 
two populations. The tertiary γ ′ 
I have higher amounts of γ former 
elements, such as Cr, Co and Mo indicating that they were the last 
precipitates to form during cooling. As a consequence, there was 
not enough time to reach the equilibrium by rejecting the γ for- 
mer elements. In addition, a chemical ﬂuctuations were observed 
in the γ matrix. In particular, the γ composition was extracted 
from three different locations denoted as #1, #2 and #3 in Fig. 12 b 
and they are given in Table 5 . It can be seen, that close to the in- 
terface of matrix with the secondary γ ′ precipitate (area #1) the 
amount of Cr and Co are relatively higher compared to the regions 
where tertiary precipitates have formed. This region correspond to 
the denuded region that observed close to the secondary γ ′ pre- 
cipitates in the powder exposed at 1150 ◦C for 15 min. By contrast, 
the amount of Ni is lower in the depleted region compared to the 
regions where tertiary γ ′ precipitates have formed. It is believed 
that the local chemical ﬂuctuations are due to coarsening of the 
secondary γ ′ precipitates, that they reject γ former elements and 
consume γ ′ former solutes from the surrounding matrix.D.M. Collins, N. D’Souza, C. Panwisawas et al. / Acta Materialia 200 (2020) 959–970

4. Discussion 
This study newly reveals the γ → γ ′ transformation behaviour 
from a Ni-base superalloy powder, building on knowledge ob- 
tained from numerous studies that targets the understanding of 
the equivalent transformation behaviour, but instead using mate- 
rial that has undergone no prior thermo-mechanical processing. 
By removing the thermo-mechanical processing aspects, this study 
aimed to identify how the γ → γ ′ evolution changes, when such 
inﬂuences are removed. In the following discussion, the mecha- 
nisms associated with precipitate formation during heating and 
cooling are discussed, followed by its relevance to practical appli- 
cation and an assessment of the characterisation methods used in 
this study. 
4.1. Precipitate formation during heating 
A schematic summary of the observed γ ′ formation behaviour 
is given in Fig. 14 . Notably, the microstructures following each of 
the heat treatments have signiﬁcantly different characteristics. The 
samples that were exposed to the subsolvus temperatures are dis- 
cussed ﬁrst. The 900 ◦C sample leaves an interconnected network 
of γ ′ precipitates, consistent with precipitates observed in super- 
alloys [38] and other systems [39] where the formation was pro- 
posed to be via spinodal decomposition. 
The starting γ phase will undergo phase separation via spinodal 
decomposition, in which nm-scale domains within the γ phase 
possess local chemical enrichment of certain elements such as Al, 
Ti, Ta and Ni. These are considered to be the γ ′ forming elements, 
whilst they are lean in the elements such as Co, Cr and Mo. Form- 
ing domains which become enriched/depleted in these elements is 
favourable as precursor clustering from the nm-scale segregation is 
already present in the powder following the gas atomisation. From 
the chemical ﬂuctuations, an ordering reaction from the A1 → L1 2 
structure will follow; noting that short range order is easy due to 
the small atomic displacements needed, leading to a ﬁne scale dis- 
persion of ordered γ ′ precipitates. 
This reaction is thermodynamically favourable if, at a low tem- 
perature, a miscibility gap exists within the γ phase where com- 
positional partitioning through spinodal decomposition leads to 
the formation of two disordered A1 structured phases, γ (1) and 
γ (2) . Subsequent chemical ordering within one of these disordered 
phases will result in L1 2 structured γ ′ precipitates. [19,38] . The 
composition of this alloy is proposed to lie within this region 
where a spontaneous unmixing reaction is favourable. It is pro- 
posed that as the sample was heated, regions with chemical ﬂuc- 
tuations were more stable than the γ phase, leading to an en- 
ergetically favourable phase separation to γ (1) + γ (2) . The ther- 
mal energy by heating enables a continuous phase separation re- 
action to proceed, promoting the formation of Al/Ti/Ta/Ni rich do- 
mains to form. When the enrichment has reached a critical value, 
a favourable L1 2 chemical ordering reaction will ensue. This mech- 
anism assumes that the transformation pathway follows spinodal 
decomposition-based phase separation ﬁrst, followed by structural 
ordering; this sequence seems probable considering the segrega- 
tion of Al/Ti/Ni and Co/Cr in the starting condition, and the L1 2 
γ ′ structure is detected via diffraction only when the compound 
exceeds ∼700 ◦C, this corresponds to the temperature where dif- 
fusion is favourable for signiﬁcant solute transport. 
An alternative transformation pathway known as conditional 
spinodal [40] is also possible. In this mechanism, a congruent or- 
dering reaction of the γ phase occurs leading to the formation of 
a single ordered γ ′ phase. Spinodal decomposition subsequently 
occurs within the γ ′ phase to form two ordered L1 2 structured 
phases, γ ′ 
(1) and γ ′ 
(2) . Only when either γ ′ 
(1) or γ ′ 
(2) undergoes a 
disordering reaction to form γ , will the ﬁnal microstructure com- 
prise both γ + γ ′ . It is, however, noted that conﬁrming this mecha- 
nism is operative during heating would be challenging as the equi- 
librium γ phase fraction increases with temperature. Distinguish- 
ing this effect over a γ ′ 
(1) → γ or γ ′ 
(2) → γ disordering reaction, 
via neutron diffraction measurements as performed in this study, 
would be diﬃcult. 
Once the γ ′ structure exists, the γ ′ precipitates grow with a 
concomitant long-range diffusion and structural ordering, as evi- 
denced by the in-situ measurements of increasing γ ′ volume frac- 
tion. The γ ′ morphology change and volume fraction increase is 
now driven by (1) minimising the elastic strain energy from lat- 
tice misﬁt strains (2) the reduction of the large interfacial energy 
associated with a ﬁne scale γ ′ and (3) reach the thermodynamic 
equilibrium composition. 
Further evidence of spinodal decomposition during heating is 
observed from the presence of small satellite reﬂections in the 
neutron diffraction data, close to fundamental reﬂections. The ob- 
servation of satellite reﬂections are direct measurements of the 
composition modulation, as has been demonstrated on different 
systems via XRD [14] and TEM [41] . Evidence of the satellite re- 
ﬂection is observed in the neutron diffraction data in this study, 
in the vicinity of the {111} reﬂection, as shown in Fig. 15 . These 
satellite reﬂections were very weak, however, could be observed 
when the data was summed. Each pattern in Fig. 15 corresponds 
to data acquired for 14 min. Whilst the temporal resolution here 
is not high, it is evident that the composition modulation associ- 
ated with spinodal is evident during heating, isothermal hold and 
initial cooling. This satellite peak disappears as the sample cools, 
indicative that the composition ﬁelds are moving towards equilib-968

rium, and the modulation is no longer strong enough to produce 
this diffraction characteristic. 
As there is evidence that the sample heated to 10 0 0 ◦C resulted 
in γ ′ initially forming during heating, the resulting γ ′ must have 
formed via spinodal decomposition, similar to the 900 ◦C sam- 
ple. The resulting microstructure comprising an approximately uni- 
modal distribution, not interconnected γ ′ like the 900 ◦C sam- 
ple, indicates this evolution is diffusion driven, enabled by the 
higher temperature heat treatment. During this time, the γ ′ form 
morphologically stable spherical precipitates, as the interfacial en- 
ergy of the precipitates reduces via coarsening, as expected from 
the Cahn-Hilliard model for spinodal decomposition [42] . The uni- 
modal γ ′ size distribution further indicates all precipitates formed 
together; initiating upon heating. As the 10 0 0 ◦C sample cools 
there is evidence of near zero lattice misﬁt, indicating the precip- 
itates did not have to overcome energetically unfavourable misﬁt 
strains, which if present, would have promoted non-spherical pre- 
cipitate morphologies due to the anisotropic stiffness of the cubic 
γ ′ [43] . 
4.2. Precipitate formation during cooling 
When γ ′ has formed during cooling, as is evident from the 
sample heated to a supersolvus temperature of 1150 ◦C then 
cooled, there is considerable evidence to indicate the precipitate 
formation mechanism is dissimilar to γ ′ formed during heating. 
The multimodal distribution is consistent with observations made 
by others, who attribute the generation of γ ′ from classical nu- 
cleation and growth [13,16,44] . Each generation of γ ′ forms dur- 
ing cooling, where the driving force for γ ′ nucleation occurs from 
increased undercooling. Growth of a γ ′ distribution will continue 
whilst the temperature is high, though its driving force for solute 
diffusion decreases as temperature becomes lower. Growth is in- 
hibited by soft impingement when solute ﬁelds overlap, however, 
further cooling results in non-equilibrium γ ′ compositions away 
from the γ / γ ′ interfaces, which with further undercooling, result 
in a further nucleation burst [15] . In this study, this mechanism 
is corroborated by (1) the presence of secondary γ ′ and tertiary 
γ ′ precipitate distributions, (2) the compositions of the precipitate 
distributions are dissimilar, indicating their formation at different 
temperatures as the supersaturated γ composition changes, (3) 
the dissimilar morphologies of secondary γ ′ (octodendritic) and 
tertiary γ ′ (spherical) indicates their growth has occurred with 
precipitates from each distribution subjected to different misﬁt 
strains. The initial secondary γ ′ to form upon cooling has a lat- 
tice misﬁt of −0.5%, suﬃcient to favour octodendritic morphology 
to develop due to the interaction between diffusion driven growth 
and non-uniform elastic strain ﬁelds around precipitates from the 
γ ′ elastic anisotropy [43] . This effect diminishes as the tempera- 
ture is lowered, such that the lattice misﬁt is close to zero whenD.M. Collins, N. D’Souza, C. Panwisawas et al. / Acta Materialia 200 (2020) 959–970 
969 
the tertiary γ ′ forms, resulting in spherical precipitates for this dis- 
tribution. Due to these factors, there was no evidence that the γ ′ 
precipitates formed by spinodal decomposition during cooling. 
4.3. Implications 
The γ ′ that has formed during heating, in the 900 ◦C and 
10 0 0 ◦C samples, is entirely a diffusion driven process. A classical 
nucleation is not plausible as there is no undercooling, and there- 
fore no driving force for this process. Unimodal γ ′ size distribu- 
tions, similar to the microstructure achieved here from the sample 
heated to 10 0 0 ◦C, have been achieved by others by cooling sam- 
ples rapidly [18,45,46] . There remains disagreement in the litera- 
ture on how such distributions form upon cooling; where the pre- 
cipitates are nucleation controlled, though undercooling is so high 
that it outruns diffusion and the condition for soft impingement is 
not met [13] , whereas Viswanathan et al. [38] indicates phase sep- 
aration initiates by spinodal decomposition. There is clear scope to 
widen the study, particularly for different compositions and cool- 
ing rates to conﬁrm under the precise conditions spinodal decom- 
position mechanism prevails. 
Whilst unimodal microstructures created by rapid cooling offer 
desirable increases in yield strength over slower cooled samples 
[46] , quenching is impractical for real manufacture of large compo- 
nents. Problems include the creation of high residual stresses [47] , 
and transient thermal gradients and inhomogeneous microstruc- 
tures [48] . The study here creates similarly desirable microstruc- 
tures (in the 10 0 0 ◦C sample, for example) directly from the pow- 
der without cooling related issues. Control at this stage could be 
used to mitigate or change parameters of subsequent thermome- 
chanical treatments. This work also has enormous implications for 
the use of nickel-base superalloy powders used in additive man- 
ufacturing (AM) processes, where the γ → γ ′ transformation be- 
haviour is largely unknown. Such AM process could exploit mi- 
crostructural control through γ ′ formation during heating regimes 
for the ﬁrst time. 
Finally, in context to the HIP treatment of powders during the 
commercial fabrication of turbine rotor discs, this study gives in- 
sight into the microstructural development. The trimodal γ ′ distri- 
bution comprising primary, secondary and tertiary γ ′ during sub- 
solvus HIP treatments of RR10 0 0 [49] was not observed here. The 
absence of pressure in this study prevents primary γ ′ forming. 
This is to be expected as elevated temperature alone enables γ ′ 
to form before powder particles are fully consolidated. It is specu- 
lated that only when an externally applied pressure is suﬃcient to 
fully consolidate powder particles before γ ′ formation begins, dif- 
fusional processes at grain boundaries required to nucleate primary 
γ ′ are possible. Conﬁrming this mechanism is proposed for future 
work. 
4.4. Characterisation 
To quantify the γ → γ ′ reactions in-situ, the ENGIN-X beam- 
line was selected for its ability to obtain diffraction data from a 
large sample volume (several mm 3 ), without the signal being sig- 
niﬁcantly attenuated by an alumina crucible containing the pow- 
der, a high temperature furnace and a rapid data acquisition rate 
(1.5 min per pattern). To analyse results from data collected at this 
rate, however, a new data analysis strategy was employed here, 
based on constrained Gaussian proﬁles. 
The diffraction line proﬁle shape used here was Gaussian, 
deemed to be a suitable approximation to the experimentally ob- 
tained line proﬁle shape. Whilst the pure instrument proﬁle for 
reﬂections from ENGIN-X is better ﬁtted with a convolution of a 
Voigt function with a truncated exponential [50] , no peak asym- 
metry nor Cauchy character was evident, which is explained by 
dominant broadening contributions from the specimen geometry 
and sample size/strain broadening. Using a Gaussian line proﬁle 
also had the advantage that the intensities of the γ and γ ′ re- 
ﬂections of a fundamental reﬂection can be easily coupled via the 
analytical solution of integrated Gaussian intensity (i.e. Eq. (5) ). 
This signiﬁcantly constrained the problem of ﬁtting 2 superim- 
posed reﬂections with independent variables for each, which is 
most diﬃcult when γ
and γ ′ phases have near identical lat- 
tice parameters. Fitting the data here with more complex func- 
tions, such as those with convolutions, was found to be inap- 
propriate due to increased ﬁtting variables that results in scat- 
ter in the ﬁtted coeﬃcients, primarily due to numerical insta- 
bility. The approach adopted here demonstrated that the use of 
more complex ﬁtting functions to analyse superalloy datasets is 
suitable only when high signal-to-noise data is available (i.e. syn- 
chrotron data over time-of-ﬂight data collected here) or when 
γ / γ ′ differences in lattice parameter make direct peak separation 
possible. 
5. Conclusions 
The phase transformation from γ to γ ′ was investigated in 
a nickel-base superalloy powder subjected to heat treatments at 
90 0 ◦C, 10 0 0 ◦C and 1150 ◦C for 15 min with controlled heating 
and cooling during in-situ neutron diffraction. Insights here were 
combined with post mortem characterisation using atom probe to- 
mography and electron microscopy to elucidate composition and 
microstructure evolution. From this, the following conclusions can 
be drawn: 
1. Characterisation of the gas atomised powder, prior to any 
further processing, shows no evidence of structural ordering, 
however, near-atomic scale compositional segregation was ob- 
served. Cr and Co atoms were found to segregate together, 
whereas Ni, Al and Ti atoms are repelled by Cr atoms result- 
ing in regions enriched in γ ′ elements. This segregational be- 
haviour can act as the precursor to phase separation. 
2. A thermal cycle reaching 900 ◦C leads to the formation of 
γ ′ precipitates during heating by spinodal decomposition, con- 
ﬁrmed by neutron diffraction and atom probe tomography. The 
γ ′ precipitates in this case formed only during heating and pos- 
sessed an interconnected γ ′ network with an irregular mor- 
phology. No γ ′ precipitates formed during cooling. Signiﬁcant 
composition variation was observed in the γ phase in the post 
mortem analysis. 
3. A thermal cycle reaching 10 0 0 ◦C similarly formed γ ′ via spin- 
odal decomposition during heating. The γ ′ volume fraction in- 
creased during cooling whilst solute diffusion prevailed, as the 
system approached thermodynamic equilibrium. Observing this 
material post mortem indicates the system is indeed closer 
to equilibrium compared to the 900 ◦C sample, comprising a 
unimodal γ ′ distribution, a homogenous γ & γ ′ composition 
and coarser spherical precipitate morphology, indicative of a re- 
duced interfacial energy. 
4. A multimodal γ ′ distribution was observed after heating above 
the γ ′ solvus at 1150 ◦C, where γ ′ precipitates formed only 
during cooling based on classical nucleation and growth mech- 
anisms; there was no evidence of spinodal decomposition. This 
mechanism was corroborated by distribution of precipitates 
sizes, compositional differences between different populations 
of secondary and tertiary γ ′ precipitates, and morphology dif- 
ferences between the γ ′ distributions associated with their dif- 
ferent lattice misﬁt strains during their formation. Chemical 
ﬂuctuations were also observed in the γ matrix as a function 
of distance from secondary γ ′ precipitates.970
