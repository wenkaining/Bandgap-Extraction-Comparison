We report first principles calculations of the phonon dispersions of PbTe both for its observed structure
and under compression. At the experimental lattice parameter we find a near instability of the optic
branch at the zone center, in accord with experimental observations. This hardens quickly towards the
zone boundary. There is also a very strong volume dependence of this mode, which is rapidly driven away
from an instability by compression. These results are discussed in relation to the thermal conductivity of
the material.

1. Introduction
The thermoelectric performance of a material is quantified
using a dimensionless, temperature dependent figure of merit,
ZT
=
σS2T/κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is
the thermal conductivity, and S is the thermopower. Thus it is
clear that high thermoelectric performance is generally found
in materials with low thermal conductivity, and in fact various
strategies for lowering thermal conductivity based on phonon
scattering have been employed [1–4]. These include alloying to
produce mass disorder as in SiGe, the use of materials with
large complex unit cells, and the use of materials with rattling
ions, such as filled clathrate materials [4]. In this regard rocksalt
structure PbTe is a remarkable thermoelectric material. It is based
on a small, high symmetry unit cell, has high coordination of
both atomic species (6-fold), and contains no obvious rattling
ion. Nonetheless, n-type PbTe has high values of ZT above room
temperature and as such was used in spacecraft power generators.
[5,6] It also has low thermal conductivity, reported as 2.3 W/(m K)
at ambient temperature [7]. More recently, a family of so-called
LAST compounds based on intergrowths of PbTe and AgxSbTe2
have been shown to have values of ZT well above unity [8], and

additionally quantum dot systems based on PbTe have also shown
high values of ZT [9].
Thermal properties of materials in general rest on the phonon
dispersions. While electronic and related properties of PbTe have
been rather extensively studied using first principles methods [10–
14], the phonon dispersions have not been reported. The purpose of
this paper is to report these dispersions, as obtained within density
functional theory.
2. Approach
The calculations reported here were done within the frame-
work of density functional theory primarily using the local density
approximation. The quantum espresso code was used with norm
conserving pseudopotentials to obtain the phonon dispersions via
linear response [15]. Convergence tests were performed to deter-
mine the needed planewave basis cut-off and zone sampling. The
results shown used a planewave basis set with a 60 Ry cutoff and an
6 × 6 × 6 special k-points Brillouin zone sampling. We performed
convergence tests with a 75 Ry cutoff and an 8 × 8 × 8 special
k-points Brillouin zone sampling but found no significant differ-
ences in phonon frequencies. In addition, some calculations were
done with the linearized augmented planewave (LAPW) method
including local orbitals [16]. These provide a check for the pseu-
dopotential results. Calculations were performed as a function of
lattice parameter. The calculated LAPW LDA lattice parameter is

6.39 Å, which is slightly more than 1% smaller than the experimen-
tal room temperature lattice parameter of 6.464 Å, [17] and within
1% of the 120 K value of 6.438 Å [18]. For comparison the calculated
LAPW lattice parameter within the generalized gradient approxi-
mation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof [19] is 6.57 Å, which as is
sometimes that case for materials with heavy elements [20] is fur-
ther from experiment than the LDA. We therefore use the LDA, and
perform calculations as a function of lattice parameter. Assuming
that PbTe behaves like other materials with soft phonons, compar-
ison with experiment should be done for the phonon dispersions
calculated at the experimental lattice parameter [21].
3. Results and discussion
Our main results are the phonon dispersions, which are given
in Fig. 1. As may be seen, PbTe is near a zone center phonon
instability, associated with the transverse optic (TO) mode. This
is an inversion center breaking phonon, and would lead to a
ferroelectric ground state if it were actually unstable. This is not
a surprising result and in particular is in accord with experimental
studies of NaCl structure group IV tellurides. The related materials
SnTe and GeTe are in fact ferroelectric, with rhombohedral ground
states corresponding to freezing in of the soft TO mode with
displacements along a [111] direction [22–24].
The ferroelectricity of GeTe has been studied in detail using
first principles calculations by Rabe and co-workers [25–27],
who showed quantitative agreement between the predictions of
LDA calculations and experiment. Bussmann–Holder used model
calculations to investigate the phase diagrams of various alloys
including PbTe–SnTe and PbTe–GeTe and made arguments for the
nearness of PbTe to ferroelectricity [28]. In fact it was known
that PbTe shows a dielectric constant that increases at low T
as well as a TO phonon mode that decreases in frequency as
the temperature is lowered, [23,29] although the detailed T
dependence is complicated by a doping level dependence. In any
case, Burhard and co-workers [29] obtained obtained a very soft
frequency of 17.5 cm−1 from optical measurements on PbTe films.
This value is consistent with the very low value of 12 cm−1 that
we obtain at the reported experimental lattice parameter. This
difference of ∼5 cm−1 is well within the usual errors of LDA
calculations.
Comparing the two panels of Fig. 1, one may note a strong
volume dependence of the TO phonon frequency around the
zone center. This frequency at Γ is plotted as a function of
lattice parameter in Fig. 2. As may be seen there is a very
strong volume dependence to the soft TO mode. Compressing
the lattice parameter to 6.40 Å, which is less than 0.6% smaller
than the 120 K value, more than doubles the TO frequency from
12 cm−1 to 27 cm−1. The LO mode on the other hand shows a quite
ordinary, modest volume dependence. While such strong volume
dependences of soft mode phonon frequencies are unusual they
have been noted before in complex oxide ferroelectrics, such as
Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, BaTiO3 and KNbO3 [21,30,31]. The present results
show that there is a similar behavior in PbTe in spite of the much
simpler structure of this material in comparison with the oxide
ferroelectrics.
Returning to the issue of the thermoelectric properties of PbTe,
the material clearly does not involve alloying with different mass
ions or a large complex unit cell to lower thermal conductivity.
Furthermore, the acoustic modes are not anomalously soft.
One mechanism that has been discussed in the context of
thermoelectric materials is the use of so-called rattlers. These are
loosely bound atoms in a crystal structure that couple to the low
frequency part of the phonon spectrum leading to scattering. One
may ask then if there is an analogy between the soft TO vibrations
near the zone center and a material containing rattlers. One such

connection can be made based on the strong volume dependence.
Longitudinal acoustic (LA) vibrations are compressive waves and
so the strong volume dependence of the TO mode implies strong
anharmonic coupling between the TO branch and the LA phonons.
Furthermore, we find that the TO modes are highly anharmonic
themselves. Fig. 3 shows the calculated energy as a function of TO
mode amplitude at the experimental volume. As may be seen the
energy surface remains very soft up to large amplitude ∼0.1 Å, and
then starts to stiffen in a quite anharmonic way. This may be seen,
e.g. from the difference between [001] and [111] energies, which
arises due to the anharmonicity. For large amplitudes the softest
direction is [111] in agreement with the experimental ground state
of GeTe. However, even for [001] displacements the energy surface
is very soft implying large amplitude vibrations even at room
temperature. However, it should be noted that the TO mode is only
soft near the zone center, and so the mean square displacementJ. An et al. / Solid State Communications 148 (2008) 417–419

will be less than that implied by the position of the kT = 300 K line
on Fig. 3. This also means that unlike rattling modes in clathrates,
for example, the soft TO modes in PbTe are strongly k-dependent,
similar to the acoustic modes.
4. Conclusion
While the above results do not provide a quantitative descrip-
tion of the thermal conductivity of PbTe they do show that there
are unusual features of the phonon spectrum that are generally as-
sociated with reduced thermal conductivity. In particular we find
very soft TO phonon branches near the zone center as may be ex-
pected in a material near ferroelectricity. Importantly, these modes
are very volume dependent which implies strong anharmonic cou-
pling to longitudinal acoustic modes. Furthermore, although the
TO modes are quite k-dependent, which is not an indicator of low
thermal conductivity, they are also highly anharmonic, as seen
from the Fig. 3. This normally will lead to increased scattering at
high temperature and accordingly reduced thermal conductivity.
In ordinary materials heat is carried primarily by acoustic
phonons. Therefore, strongly reduced thermal conductivity is
expected when all or most of the acoustic phonon branch is
subject to strong scattering. In the case of PbTe, the TO mode
extends to low frequency at low temperature and hardens as
temperature is raised. Considering the present results for the
volume dependence of the TO mode, it may be expected that local
strain variations, e.g. due to variations in chemical composition or
internal interfaces, at the level of ±1% would be sufficient to shift
the minimum of the TO branch over a large part of the acoustic
frequency range and may therefore lead to a substantial change
in thermal conductivity. This level of strain variation may be quite
realizable in nanostructured material since it is within the range
that can normally be obtained via epitaxial stabilization in e.g. thin
films.
