We examine the anisotropic properties of the exchange stiffness constant A for a rare-earth permanent magnet,
Nd2Fe14B, by connecting analyses with two different scales of length, i.e., Monte Carlo (MC) method with
an atomistic spin model and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with a continuous magnetic model. The
atomistic MC simulations are performed on the spin model of Nd2Fe14B constructed from ab initio calculations,
and the LLG micromagnetics simulations are performed with the parameters obtained by the MC simulations.
We clarify that the amplitude and the thermal property of A depend on the orientation in the crystal, which are
attributed to the layered structure of Nd atoms and weak exchange couplings between Nd and Fe atoms. We also
conﬁrm that the anisotropy of A signiﬁcantly affects the threshold ﬁeld for the magnetization reversal (coercivity)
given by the depinning process.

I. INTRODUCTION
Inrare-earthpermanentmagnetssuchasNd2Fe14B,SmCo5,
Sm2Fe17N3, and so on, the rare-earth elements and the tran-
sition metals combine in atomic scale to produce strong mag-
netic anisotropy and strong ferromagnetic order. The strong
magnetic anisotropy originated from the 4f electrons of the
rare-earth atom is maintained at room temperature (RT) by an
interaction with the strong ferromagnetic order of the transition
metals [1,2]. However, in Nd2Fe14B which is well known as the
highest performance permanent magnet at RT [3–5], improve-
ment of coercivity at high temperature is required for industrial
application[6]becauseithasarelativelylowCurietemperature
(∼585 K) as compared with the other rare-earth magnets.
The coercivity mechanism of Nd2Fe14B and the other rare-
earth magnets has not been fully elucidated yet. To analyze
intrinsic magnetic properties of the rare-earth magnets (e.g.,
magnetization, magnetic anisotropy, exchange stiffness, Curie
temperature, etc.), we should consider the inhomogeneous
magnetic structures and thermal ﬂuctuations in an atomic
scale (∼˚A). The rare-earth magnets in the practical use are
polycrystalline materials composed of the main rare-earth
magnet phase (∼μm) and magnetic or nonmagnetic grain
boundary phases (∼nm). Therefore, the coercivity depends
on not only the intrinsic magnetic parameters, such as the
anisotropy energy of the main phase, but also on the magnetic
properties of the grain boundary and microstructure of the
main and grain phases [7,8]. For this reason, study of the
coercivity requires analyses from the atomic scale (∼˚A) to
the macroscopic scale (∼μm). This fact has inhibited us to
elucidate the coercivity in a systematic manner.
Theoretically analyses for the coercivity in most have been
carried out with a continuum model that uses the magnetic
anisotropy constants Ku and the exchange stiffness constant
A as macroscopic parameters [see Eq. (2)]. In the junction
systems consisting of hard and soft magnetic phases [9–12], it
has been indicated that both Ku and A have a large effect
on incoherent magnetization reversals (i.e., nucleation and
depinning) which reduce the coercivity from the value of
the uniform reversal. In order to elucidate the coercivity
mechanism and improve the coercivity at high temperatures,
it is important to clarify the temperature dependences of Ku
and A. Therefore, many researchers in both experimental
and theoretical have studied the thermal properties of Ku
[13–18]. However, regarding A for Nd2Fe14B, experimentally,
the values are observed only at several temperatures [19–22],
and also there is no theoretical estimation of the temperature
dependence as far as we know.
The value of A is given as a macroscopic property of
exchange stiffness of continuous magnets at each temperature.
This quantity is related to the domain wall (DW) width
[23] and the critical (magnetization reversal) nucleus size
[7]. For some other magnetic materials, YCo5 and L10-type
magnets (CoPt, FePd, FePt), Belashchenko indicated using
ab initio calculation that A depends on the orientation in the
crystals [24]. Fukazawa et al. also pointed out the anisotropic
A for Sm(Fe, Co)12 compounds [25]. Recently, Nishino
et al. examined the temperature dependence of DW width
of Nd2Fe14B using an atomistic spin model constructed
from ab initio calculations and indicated that it also has
an orientation dependence [26]. Although, in Ref. [24], the
effect of anisotropic A on coercivity is also discussed in a

phenomenological way, microscopic understanding of the
temperature and orientation dependences of A is essential for
the coercivity mechanism in the Nd2Fe14B magnet.
In the present paper, by a comparison of the results obtained
by a continuum model and those obtained by the atomistic
spin model constructed from ab initio calculations (same spin
model as Refs. [18,26,27]), we study the temperature and
the orientation dependence of A for the Nd2Fe14B magnet.
The comparison of the two different scale models is done by
makinguseofmagneticDWenergy.Thisschemehasbeenused
successfully for FePt [28–30] and Co [31] magnetic materials.
We ﬁnd that A has the anisotropic property in Nd2Fe14B.
Moreover, the reason for the anisotropy is attributed to the
weakexchangecouplingsofNdandFeatoms.Additionally,we
performed micromagnetics simulations on the conﬁguration in
which a soft magnetic phase is attached to the (001) plane or
(100) plane of a grain of Nd2Fe14B. The simulations predict
that the anisotropy of A reduces the coercivity for the former
conﬁguration because A of the z direction is larger than that of
the x direction, while it enhances the coercivity for the latter
conﬁguration. The series of the calculation schemes in the
present study corresponds to the multiscale analysis [32,33]
that connects different scales from ab initio calculation to
coercivity as macroscopic physics.
II. MODELS AND METHOD
A. Atomistic spin model
To include the information of electronic states at an atom-
istic scale, we treat the (spin) magnetic moment of each atom
as a classical spin and then construct a classical Heisenberg
model. The atomistic Hamiltonian has the form:
H = −2

i<j
˜Jij ei · ej
−

l,i ,
(1)
where
˜Jij is the Heisenberg exchange coupling constants
including the spin amplitudes (SiSj) between the ith and jth
sites, and ei is the normalized spin moment at the ith site. The
coefﬁcient Di in the second term denotes the strength of the
magnetic anisotropy of Fe sites. The third term is the magnetic
anisotropy of Nd sites, which is formulated by the crystal ﬁeld
theory for 4f electrons [34,35], Bml
l,i is the crystal electric ﬁeld
coefﬁcient and ˆOml
l,i is the Stevens operator. In the present study,
Bml
l,i takes a ﬁxed value, whereas ˆOml
l,i depends on the state of
a total angular momentum of 4f electrons, J i. Here, we ﬁx
J i parallel to the normalized spin moment on the ith site,
i.e., J i = Jiei (Ji = 9/2 for Nd atom). For simplicity, we
consider only the diagonal terms ml = 0.
For these input parameters of Nd2Fe14B magnet, we adopt
the same values in previous studies [18,26,27]. Exchange
coupling constants, ˜Jij, were calculated with Liechtenstein’s
formula [36] on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green’s-
function code, MACHIKANEYAMA (AKAIKKR) [37]. In the
present study, to reduce computational cost, we use only short-
range exchange couplings within the range of rcut = 3.52 ˚A,
in which primary Fe-Fe and Nd-Fe interactions are included.

types of spin conﬁgurations for Nd2Fe14B atomistic spin model:
DW orientation is along (b) the yz plane (Type I) and (c) the
xy plane (Type II). The arrows in ﬁgures describe the antiparallel
(AP) boundary condition. These crystal structures were plotted using
VESTA [41].
Anisotropy terms, Di and Bml
l,i , were determined from the
previous ﬁrst-principles calculation [38] and the experimental
result [35], respectively. Consequently, the atomistic spin
model uses many input parameters in a unit cell which includes
68atoms[seeFig.1(a)].Thepreviousstudy[18]conﬁrmedthat
the model and parameters are highly reliable for the magnetic
properties of the Nd2Fe14B magnet.
B. Continuum model
Under the continuum approximation, the micromag-
netic energy of the exchange couplings and the magnetic
anisotropies at temperature T is expressed as follows [39]:

where m denotes a normalized magnetization vector, Al(T ) is
the exchange stiffness constant of each direction (x, y, z) in
the crystal, and EK is the magnetic anisotropy energy which is
usually expressed as:
EK(T, θ) = K1(T ) sin2 θ + K2(T ) sin4 θ + K4(T ) sin6 θ,
(3)
where Ku(T ) (u = 1, 2, 4) are the magnetic anisotropy con-
stants and θ is the angle of magnetization measured from the
z axis. The continuum model uses the temperature-dependent
parameters to express the thermal effects instead of thermal
ﬂuctuations in the atomistic model.
Micromagnetic simulations [39,40] have been carried out
based on the continuum approximation and Landau-Lifshitz-
Gilbert (LLG) equation which describes time evolution of
the magnetization relaxation process (see Sec. IIIC). In the
practical simulation, the real space in Eq. (2) is discretized with
a grid whose width should be smaller than a DW width and a
magnetostatic exchange length [39]. In most micromagnetic
simulations for Nd2Fe14B magnet, each grid size was set
to (1–2 nm)3, and as the input parameters, experimentally
observed values of Al(T ) and Ku(T ) were used. In the
continuum model, many input parameters of Eq. (1) in atomic
scale are expected to be renormalized in the few macroscopic
parameters of Eq. (2) at each temperature.
C. Methods for determining Ku(T ) and A(T )
In the present study, the macroscopic parameters are eval-
uated by comparing the energies of the DW and of the
magnetic anisotropy obtained by the above two models at each
temperature. We use a Monte Carlo (MC) scheme to calculate
Helmholtz free energies on the atomistic spin model. In order
to evaluate A, we consider the two quantities obtained from
DW energy: Edw(T ) and Fdw(T ) [23,29]. Edw is the DW energy
in the continuum model, which is expressed by the following
formula:
Edw(T ) = 2

A(T )
 π

dθ

EK(T, θ).
(4)
To obtain A(T ), we need the values of Edw(T ) and EK(T, θ).
We regard Edw(T ) to be equal to the DW free energy in
the atomistic spin model, Fdw(T ), which is expressed by the
following formula:
Fdw(T ) = T
 ∞
T
dT ′ Edw(T ′)
(T ′)2 .
(5)
The DW internal energy, Edw(T ), is deﬁned as an energy
difference between the internal energies obtained in different
boundary conditions with and without DW. For this calcula-
tion, we ﬁx the boundaries in the direction antiparallel (AP)
or parallel (PA). Additionally, since the crystal structure of
Nd2Fe14B has anisotropy, we consider two models with the
two ﬁxed boundaries depicted in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). Thus,
we have two types of DWs [26]. One is a DW along the yz
plane (type I), and the other is along the xy plane (type II). We
set the periodic boundary condition in the yz(xy) plane for the
model of type I (type II).
To calculate EK(T, θ), we adopt the constrained MC
(C-MC) method for the atomistic spin model. The C-MC

method samples spin conﬁgurations under the condition of a
ﬁxed angle of total magnetization, which allows us to calculate
the angle dependence of the spin torque and the free energy
[42]. By considering that EK is equal to the free energy
of magnetic anisotropy, we calculate EK from the atomistic
model. The previous study [18] showed the validity of the
C-MC methods for calculating Ku(T ) in EK(T, θ) of the
Nd2Fe14B atomistic spin model. Note that if Eq. (3) is given
in the form EK = K1 sin2 θ (K2 = K4 = 0), Eq. (4) can be
integrated analytically and gives the well known relation:
Edw(T ) = 4√A(T )K1(T ).
In the present paper, the MC and C-MC simulations run
100 000–200 000 MC steps for equilibrium and the following
100 000–200 000 MC steps for taking statistical averages,
where a MC step corresponds to one trial for each spin to be
updated. We calculated the average of magnetic anisotropy
energies and DW energies from 8–20 different runs with
different initial conditions and random sequences.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Magnetic anisotropy and domain wall energy
As mentioned above, the evaluation of the exchange stiff-
ness constant requires precise calculations of the magnetic
anisotropy constants and the DW energy. First, we show the
temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy constants
calculated by the C-MC method in Fig. 2, which qualitatively
agrees with previous experiments [14,15]. There, we used the
system of 10 × 10 × 7 unit cells imposing the periodic bound-
ary conditions. In uniaxial anisotropy, we study the quanti-
ties: FA(T ) ≡EK(T, θ = π/2) = EK(T, π/2) −EK(T, 0) =

u Ku(T ). Figure 2 shows that FA(T ) rapidly decreases with
the temperature below 400 K. This temperature dependence
is understood as a result of fragile thermal properties of Nd
atoms. That is, while at low temperature, the anisotropy of Nd
atoms is dominant, the anisotropy of Nd atoms decreases with
the temperature more rapidly than that of Fe atoms, because the
exchange ﬁeld of a Nd atom (sum of exchange couplings that

that of a Fe atom (see also the detailed discussion in Ref. [18]).
Additionally, owing to the higher order terms of the Nd
anisotropy, B0
4, B0
6, the magnetization of Nd2Fe14B is tilted
from the z axis at low temperatures. This fact causes the
deviation from uniaxial anisotropy to occur in the region of
−2K2 < K1 < 0 [43]. Note that Eq. (4) is deﬁned under the
condition of uniaxial anisotropy. Thus, in the present paper,
we discuss the DW energy and the exchange stiffness in the
region of T ⩾200 K.
As a matter of practice, ﬁnite-size effect of numerical results
about the magnetic anisotropy is signiﬁcant for the evaluation
of the exchange stiffness and the DW width, especially at high
temperatures. To avoid this problem, we extrapolate FA(T )
and
 π
0 dθ√EK(T, θ) [these are used in Eqs. (7) and (4)] to
the thermodynamic limit (N →∞) using linear functions in
N−1/3. Figure 3 shows the typical ﬁtting results which indicate
that the MC results are well ﬁtted with the linear functions.
The extrapolated results for FA near the Curie temperature TC
are summarized in the inset of Fig. 2, where we ﬁx as Ku =
0 above TC(= 870 K). We use these extrapolated results to
evaluate the exchange stiffness and the DW width.
Next, we focus on the DW energy. Figure 4 shows the
temperature dependence of the DW internal energy, Edw, for
the two DW types (see Fig. 1). We also plot Edw for three
different system sizes in the directions perpendicular to the
DWs, i.e., Lx = 14, 17, and 21 (Lz = 10, 12, and 15), for
type I (type II). From these results, it is conﬁrmed that these
systems are large enough to calculate Edw. To analyze in detail
the temperature dependence, we divided Edw into the magnetic
anisotropyterm(EK
dw)andtheexchangeterm(EJ
dw)andplotthe
contributions in Fig. 4. The DW energies of type I and type II
show a qualitatively similar temperature dependence. Both
energy terms naturally vanish for T ⩾TC, because DW does
not appear even in the AP boundary condition. For T < TC, the
anisotropy term decreases monotonically as the temperature

increases whereas the exchange term increases and takes a
peak value at the temperature Th slightly below TC.
The temperature dependences are interpreted as follows.
The monotonic decrease of EK
dw is merely due to the decrease
of the thermally averaged magnetic moments, which also
corresponds to the decrease of FA(T ) in Fig. 2. The magnetic
anisotropy energy depends on the angle from the z axis of
each spin, whereas the exchange coupling energy depends
on the relative angle of spin pairs. Now, the DW energy is

the spin conﬁguration is forcibly twisted, and the DW has
a spiral noncollinear structure with the perpendicular (xy)
component at low temperatures. This fact gives the difference
of the energies EJ

the noncollinear structure would be enhanced near the critical
point where the width of DW increases.
At a temperature Th which is slightly lower than TC, the pro-
ﬁle of perpendicular (xy) moments is destroyed by the thermal
ﬂuctuation. As a thermally averaged magnetic structure, the
noncollinear structure(thespiral structure) becomes acollinear
structure. At this point, EJ
dw takes the peak value at Th and then
decreases rapidly and approaches zero towards TC. This break
of the noncollinear structure was discussed in previous studies
as the disappearance of an xy magnetization inside the DW
[29,44,45].
By those internal DW energies and Eq. (5), we can calculate
DW free energies, Fdw. In Fig. 5, we plot the temperature
dependence of Fdw and Edw (the same data shown in Fig. 4)
for both DW types. The differences between Fdw and Edw cor-
respond to the contribution of magnetic entropy. The difference
in the DW energy between type I and type II naturally indicates
an anisotropy concerning the direction in which DWs are
generated. The DW prefers to be generated in the conﬁguration
of type II. These observations imply the magnetization reversal
starts from the z plane. Moreover, the generation of the DW
in the magnets would also depend on the grain boundary
phase and the dipole-dipole interaction. We will discuss these
properties in a more realistic magnetization reversal process in
Sec. IIIC.
B. Exchange stiffness constant
The exchange stiffness constants A for the two directions
can be evaluated by using Eq. (4) and the numerical results
for the magnetic anisotropy and the DW energy, whose tem-
perature dependences are shown in Fig. 6. Here, we deﬁne the
value of A calculated from the conﬁguration of type I (type II)
as the exchange stiffness constant of the x(z) direction, Ax(z).
Reﬂecting the anisotropy of the DW energy, the exchange
stiffness constant naturally has the anisotropy depending on the
direction in the crystal. For the comparison of A with exper-
imental values, it is reasonable to normalize the temperature
dependence with TC, because the spin model overestimates

results are well consistent with the lower experimental values

To conﬁrm the validity of our evaluation procedure for A,
in Fig. 7, we compared our results (circle) with those of the
previous study (square) [26].
In the previous study, δdw was evaluated directly from the
snapshots of spin conﬁgurations using the same atomistic
Hamiltonian of the present study. Note that we set the periodic
boundary condition in the yz(xy) plane for the model of type
I (type II), whereas the previous calculation was performed
under the open-boundary conditions for both models. Our
results of δdw qualitatively agree with the previous results,
although they tend to take a smaller value because the thermal
ﬂuctuation becomes smaller than the previous study due to the
difference of boundary conditions. The comparisons with the
previous experiments and the numerical study as mentioned
above guarantee our results concerning A.
Now, we study its thermal properties. The temperature
dependence of A is often discussed in relation to magnetization

where M(T ) is the amplitude of the magnetization (not
shown, see Ref.
[18]). Under a mean ﬁeld approximation
with homogeneous spin systems, the exponent n is 2 [30,46].
However, under more accurate methods, the exponent takes
a value different from 2, for example, FePt: n = 1.76 [30],
hcp-Co: n = 1.79 [31]. Thus we estimate n to examine the
thermal properties for the Nd2Fe14B, by ﬁtting A(T ) in Fig. 6
with the form CM(T )n, where C is a ﬁtting constant.
Note that n depends on the ﬁtting range of tempera-
ture nx(z) = 1.68 (1.84) in the range of 200–860 K, whereas
nx(z) = 1.46 (1.69) in the range of 200–400 K. Fitting lines of
the former and the latter are plotted by the solid and dotted lines
in Fig. 6, respectively. Microscopically, Fe and Nd show differ-
ent thermal properties. Indeed, Nd atoms have weak exchange
coupling and so do not have much inﬂuence on A, whereas
they have a large magnetic moment (∼2.87 μB/atom). The
magnetization of Nd atoms is decreased more rapidly with
temperature than that of Fe atoms, which largely affects
the temperature dependence of total magnetization. Thus,
intrinsically n depends on the ﬁtting range largely. However,
the important point here is that nz always takes larger values
than nx regardless of the ﬁtting range (we checked it). This
relation implies the macroscopic exchange coupling in the z
direction is weaker than that in the x direction, not only for the
coupling strength but also for thermal tolerance.
As the reason for the anisotropy of A to crystal orienta-
tion, the crystal structure of Nd2Fe14B is naturally invoked.
Nd2Fe14B has the layered structure of the Fe layer and
NdFe layer (B has little effect on magnetic properties) along
the z axis as shown in Fig. 1(a). In Nd2Fe14B, exchange
couplings [ ˜Jij in Eq. (1)] are mainly contributed by bond-
ing between Fe and Fe atoms, ˜JFe-Fe, and between Nd and
Fe atoms, ˜JNd-Fe (| ˜JNd-Nd| is negligibly small). Each bond

of
˜JFe-Fe has much larger amplitudes than
˜JNd-Fe ( ˜JFe-Fe :
−4.35–22.34 meV, ˜JNd-Fe : −0.16–3.55 meV). Therefore, it
is anticipated that the anisotropy of A comes from the inhomo-
geneous distribution of the exchange couplings and the atom
positions in the crystal structure. To support this anticipation
in detail, we examine the relation between the anisotropy and
the strength of ˜JNd-Fe.
Figure 8 shows the ratio of Az to Ax for four models with
different values of ˜JNd-Fe. Beside the default model (1.0 ˜JNd-Fe,
the ratio is calculated from Fig. 6), we also calculate three other
cases with all the bonds ˜JNd-Fe reduced by half (0.5 ˜JNd-Fe),
increased by half (1.5 ˜JNd-Fe), and doubled (2.0 ˜JNd-Fe). It is
clearly found that A gets close to isotropic (i.e., Az = Ax) as
˜JNd-Fe increases in the whole temperature range.
As another feature, the ratio slowly decreases with the
temperature for all the cases, which indicates that the temper-
ature dependence of Ax and Az are different. This difference
corresponds to the difference between nx and nz in Eq. (8).
As the temperature increases, the contribution of ˜JNd-Fe to A
becomes smaller than that of ˜JFe-Fe because the spin moments
of Nd atoms are more easily broken by thermal ﬂuctuations
compared with those of Fe atoms. From the above analysis, we
conclude that the reason for the anisotropy of A in Nd2Fe14B
comes from the weakness of ˜JNd-Fe and the layered structure
of Nd atoms.
C. Effect of anisotropic exchange on coercivity
Let us consider the effects of the anisotropy of A on the
coercivity. In actual rare-earth magnets which are composed of
main rare-earth magnet phase and (magnetic or nonmagnetic)
grain boundary phase, magnetization reversal is considered
to occur by nucleation near the interface and by the DW
propagation. Thus, to study magnetization reversal in such
a process, we carried out micromagnetic simulations for the
two-phase models composed of the soft magnetic phase and the
hard magnetic phase, depicted in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b). The soft
phase represents the grain boundary phase. The two models

The simulations are based on the ﬁnite-difference method

where Mi is the magnetization vector of the ith cell, γ is

cell of (1.0 nm)3 and we set |γ | = 2.21 × 105 m/A sec (the
value of free electron) and α = 1 (coercivity does not depend
on α). Effective magnetic ﬁeld on the ith cell, Heff

cells of the ith cell, mi = Mi/|Mi|, eu is the unit vector of

and jth cells (i.e., dij = 1.0 nm), Aij is the exchange stiffness
constant, and Ki
1 is the magnetic anisotropy constant (terms of
Ki
2 and Ki
4 were omitted for simplicity).
In the present study, we determine the input model pa-
rameters in Eq. (10) from the MC results at 400 K. The
model parameters in the hard phases are set to |Mi| = 1.38 T,
Ki
1 = 2.63 MJ/m3, Aij = 12.21 pJ/m for the pairs of iz = jz,
and Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for the pairs of iz ̸= jz, where iz(jz)
is the position of the i(j )th cell in the z axis. In the soft
phases, the model parameters are set to |Mi| = 1.38 T, Ki
1 =
0 MJ/m3, and Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for all the pairs of (i, j).
The difference of Aij in the direction for the hard phases
reﬂects the anisotropy of A in the MC results. In addition,
we assume Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for the bonds connecting the
soft/hard interfaces.
By applying the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm [48] to
the LLG equation with the above-constructed models, we sim-
ulated the magnetization reversal dynamics and then evaluated
the coercivity. In the simulation, we set the Runge-Kutta time
step to 0.1 ps, the magnetic ﬁeld (Hext) is reduced by 25 mT at
each ﬁeld step, and the convergence condition under each ﬁeld
is when the average of magnetization torque, |mi × Heff
i |, is
lower than 1.0 mOe. Also, to avoid the case of mi × Heff
i
∼0,
at the beginning of each ﬁeld step, a disturbance is added
to the magnetization vector of every cell as mi →(mi +
v)/|mi + v|, where v is a random vector of length 10−4.
Using the simulation conditions, the magnetization reversal
of the hard phase (not including the soft phase) occurs at
4.80 T which is consistent with the Stoner-Wohlfarth limit,
2K1/Ms = 4.789 T.
In such two-phase models, a magnetization reversal is
expected to start from the soft phase. Thus, we also examine
the inﬂuence of soft phase thickness, sl. In Fig. 9(c), we plot
sl dependence of the coercivity for the models (a) and (b). It
is clearly seen that the coercivity of the model (a) is weaker
than that of the model (b) regardless of sl. The relation of the
coercivities between the two models is also consistent with that
of the magnitude of DW energy in each direction (see Fig. 5).
Since the models (a) and (b) are equivalent in the absence of
anisotropy of Aij in the hard phase, we can conclude that the
difference of the coercivity is attributed to the anisotropic A.
It is also seen that as sl increases, the coercivity decreases
and gradually approaches a certain value for each model, and
the difference between two models increases. As we will see
in the following two paragraphs, this behavior is explained as a
change in magnetization reversal mechanism from nucleation
type to depinning type. Here we deﬁne the nucleation type as
a magnetization reversal of the whole system that occurs by a
nucleation which starts from nucleation at the surface of the
softphasewithoutdepinningattheinterfaceofthesoftandhard
parts, while in the depinning type, the reversed magnetization
in the soft phase is pinned at the interface until the magnetic
ﬁeld reaches the threshold of the depinning.
Figure 9(d) shows the hysteresis loops (showing the only
upper part in the ﬁgure) for the model (a) with four different sl.
When the soft phase is thin (sl = 1, 3 nm), the magnetization
054418-7TOGA, NISHINO, MIYASHITA, MIYAKE, AND SAKUMA
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 98, 054418 (2018)
of the hard phase is reversed at the same time as the nucleation
at the soft phase (i.e., the nucleation type), whereas when the
soft phase is thick (sl = 5, 7 nm), coercivity is determined
not from the nucleation but from the depinning (i.e., the
depinning type). The change between the nucleation type and
depinning type were also pointed out in the previous studies
for a one-dimensional model in which a soft phase of ﬁnite
width is sandwiched between hard phases [9–12] and a corner
defect model [49].
In the one-dimensional model an analytical solution of the
coercivity in the limit sl →∞, which means the depinning
type, was also proposed as follows [10,11]:

(11)
where |MS(H)|, KS(H)
1
, and AS(H) are the model parameters
of Eq. (10) in the soft (hard) phase. To apply Eq. (11) to the
three-dimensional models, as the value of AH, we use the value
of Aij in the direction perpendicular to the soft/hard interface
and calculate Hdwp. Dashed lines in Fig. 9(c) indicate Hdwp
for the models, which seems to explain well the lower limit of
depinning type coercivity for our three-dimensional models.
Therefore, it is understood that the anisotropy of A has a large
effect on the coercivity of the depinning type compared with
that of the nucleation type.
Finally, we study the inﬂuence of the dipole-dipole interac-
tion on the coercivity in the two models. Magnetic ﬁeld due
to the dipole-dipole interaction is incorporated in Heff

as the
following form:
Hdip
i

K(rij )Mj,
(12)
where K(rij ) is the demagnetization tensor [40], and rij is
the distance vector between i and j cells. Here the strength
of the dipole-dipole interaction is determined automatically
according to the distance of the pair and the magnetization
vector of the cells. We calculate Hdip
i
of all the cells in
O(NclogNc) computational time (Nc is the total number of
cells) by solving convolution integral using the fast Fourier
transform method [50]. In the present study, we set the models
(a) and (b) in Fig. 9 as cubic regardless of sl and MH = MS,
and thus the models (a) and (b) have the same shape magnetic
anisotropy.
Upper ﬁgures of Fig. 10 show sl dependence of coercivity
for the two models (a) and (b) with dipole-dipole interaction.
The red circles and the red dotted lines (Hdwp) represent the
values of the coercivity which are calculated using the same
input parameters (|Mi|, Ki
1, and Aij) as those in Fig. 9(c).
Here, the difference of coercivity in the models (a) and (b) in
Fig. 10 is mainly attributed to the dipole-dipole interaction, and
the anisotropic A is a secondary effect. Because dipole-dipole
interaction prefers to construct the DW along the z axis (type
I), in the model (b), the coercivity decreases compared with
that in Fig. 9(c). Conversely in the model (a), the coercivity
increases in the region of sl ⩾3 nm. The dipole-dipole in-
teraction inhibits us to construct the DW (nucleation) in the
xy plane. For this reason, the coercivity with dipole-dipole
interactiondependsonthearrangementofthesoftphase,which

works contrary to the effect of anisotropic exchange stiffness,
Ax > Az.
These behaviors are conﬁrmed from the hysteresis loops
in lower ﬁgures in Fig. 10. In the model (b), magnetization
reversal is clearly separated into two parts, i.e., the small jump
at the lower magnetic ﬁeld where only the soft phase is reversed
(nucleation) and the jump at the higher magnetic ﬁeld where
the DW is depinned at the interface (depinning). In contrast, in
the model (a) they are not clearly distinguished. That is, in the
model (a), the magnetization reversal mechanism approaches
the nucleation type from the depinning type by the dipole-
dipole interaction. The dependence of the coercivity on the
arrangement of the soft phase was similarly discussed in the
most recent study (not including the anisotropy of A) [51].
It is difﬁcult to clarify the effect of anisotropic A on the
coercivity under the dipole-dipole interaction by a simple
comparison of the models (a) and (b). Thus, we exchanged
the values of Ax,y and Az in the hard phase. Namely, we set
the input parameters of the hard phase as Aij = 9.10 pJ/m
for iz = jz and Aij = 12.21 pJ/m for iz ̸= jz. The values of
coercivity under these conditions are plotted by the blue circles
and the blue lines (Hdwp) in the upper ﬁgures of Fig. 10.
The anisotropy of A has a similar effect on the coercivity
054418-8ANISOTROPY OF EXCHANGE STIFFNESS BASED ON …
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 98, 054418 (2018)
as the case without dipole-dipole interaction. However, in the
model (a), the difference in coercivity is relatively small. The
anisotropic A strongly affects the coercivity of the depinning
type compared with the nucleation type. On the other hand, the
magnetization reversal in the model (a) is the nucleation type
rather than the depinning type. Therefore, we may conclude
the dipole-dipole interaction in the model (a) suppresses
the effect of the anisotropy of A.
IV. CONCLUSION
Regarding the exchange stiffness constant A of Nd2Fe14B,
we examined the temperature and orientation dependences us-
ing the Monte Carlo simulations with the atomistic spin model
constructed from the ab initio calculation. We also conducted
the coercivity calculations based on the micromagnetics (LLG)
simulations using the continuum model with the parameters
obtained by the atomic scale MC results at ﬁnite temperatures.
In this way, we conﬁrmed that the lattice structure in the
atomic scale affects the coercivity as macroscopic physics. We
found that A(T ) depends on the orientation of the crystal with
respect to not only the amplitude but also the exponent nx(z) in
the scaling behavior: Ax(z)(T ) ∝M(T )nx(z); namely Ax(T ) >
Az(T ) and nx < nz. It is quantitatively conﬁrmed that the
anisotropic properties of A come from the weak exchange
couplings between Nd and Fe atoms and the layered structure
of Nd atoms. Moreover, we also found that the anisotropic
A(T ) affects the coercivity of the depinning mechanism.
We focused on only Nd2Fe14B magnet in the present paper.
However, the essence of anisotropic A comes from the weak
exchange coupling between rare-earth atoms and transition
metals and the layered structure of rare-earth atoms. Thus,
the features discussion for Nd2Fe14B is probably applicable to
other rare-earth magnets. In fact, it was pointed out by ab initio
calculations that A have strong anisotropy for YCo5 [24] and
Sm(Fe,Co)12 [25].
Let us consider the coercivity from the viewpoint of the
exchange spring magnet [52,53] which is composed of hard
and soft phase and expected to realize the highest performance
magnet. Because realization of high performance requires
a large coercivity and a large thickness of soft phase, the
model (a) with Ax < Az [Fig. 10(a), blue line] is the most
suitable conditions in our modelings. Most strong permanent
magnets, Nd2Fe14B, YCo5, and also L10-type magnet (CoPt,
FePd, FePt), cannot reproduce the same condition because
Ax > Az [24], whereas Sm(Fe,Co)12 would do because the
anisotropyasAx < Az [25].Therefore,Sm(Fe,Co)12 andother
R(Fe,Co)12-type compounds (R is a rare-earth element) may
have higher potential to realize strong performance exchange
spring magnet rather than the other magnets.
Finally, we point out another source of the anisotropy.
In a recent experiment, it has been observed that the grain
boundary phase takes different crystal structures and chemical
compositions depending on the orientation with the Nd2Fe14B
main phase, i.e., the Nd-rich crystalline paramagnetic phase
form on the xy plane of the main phase, whereas the Fe-rich
amorphous ferromagnetic phase is in the plane parallel to the
z axis [54]. In the present paper, we have studied the effect
of anisotropy of A on coercivity and of the orientation of
the interface with the soft phase changes by using the same
interaction for the interface. However, if the chemical structure
is different, the exchange interaction would be a difference
due to another source of the anisotropy, which is studied with
information of the structure in the future.
In the continuum model, Eq. (2), we used the values of
Ku and A obtained by the MC simulations which are the
values of the bulk system. There, changes in atomic scale of
magnetic anisotropy [55–57] and exchange coupling [58–61]
near the interface or surface were not taken into consideration.
The inﬂuences of interface and surface are important for the
coercivity [6]. Thus, the accuracy multiscale analysis needs
further development of connecting scheme from atomistic spin
model to macrospin model would be necessary.
Another point noted is the range of exchange interaction.
In the atomistic spin model, Eq. (1), of the present study, we
omitted the long-range contribution of ˜Jij for simplicity and
reduction of calculation cost. However, the recent study [62]
reported that RKKY-type exchange coupling signiﬁcantly
affects the DW width and pointed out the importance of the
long-range contribution. We also found that, by incorporating
long-range exchange couplings up to 10.6 ˚A, the difference
between type I and type II of Edw at 400 K reduces from 11.3%
(in Fig. 5) to 4.4%. However, to study the effect clearly, we
need precise information of the interaction at long distance,
and we postpone study of this problem to later work. Although
there are still problems with which we must be concerned,
we believe that the present paper will be helpful to elucidate
coercivity mechanism in rare-earth permanent magnets.
