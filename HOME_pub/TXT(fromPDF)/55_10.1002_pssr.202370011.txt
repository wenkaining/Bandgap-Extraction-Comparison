Abstract 
Interfacial two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), especially the SrTiO3-based ones at the 
unexpected interface of insulators, have emerged to be a promising candidate for efficient 
charge-spin current interconversion. In this article, to gain insight into the mechanism of the 
charge-spin current interconversion at the oxide-based 2DEG, we focused on conducting 
interfaces between insulating SrTiO3 and two types of aluminium-based amorphous insulators, 
namely SrTiO3/AlN and SrTiO3/Al2O3, and estimated their charge-spin conversion efficiency, 
𝜃ୡୱ. The two types of amorphous insulators were selected to explicitly probe the overlooked 
contribution of oxygen vacancy to the 𝜃௖௦. We proposed a mechanism to explain results of spin-
torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements and developed an analysis protocol 
to reliably estimate the 𝜃ୡୱ of the oxide based 2DEG. The resultant 𝜃ୡୱ/𝑡, where 𝑡 is the 
thickness of the 2DEG, were estimated to be 0.244 nm-1 and 0.101 nm-1 for the SrTiO3/AlN and 
SrTiO3/Al2O3, respectively, and they are strikingly comparable to their crystalline counterparts. 
Furthermore, we also observe a large direct current modulation of resonance linewidth in 
SrTiO3/AlN samples, confirming its high 𝜃ୡୱ and attesting an oxygen-vacancy-enabled charge-3 
spin conversion. Our findings emphasize the defects' contribution to the charge-spin 
interconversion, especially in the oxide-based low dimensional systems, and provide a way to 
create and enhance charge-spin interconversion via defect engineering.4 
1. Introduction 
The formation of 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces has attracted 
significant research interest owing to the presence of conduction electrons at the interfaces of 
two insulators and its interesting phenomena, such as superconductivity and magnetism 1-3. In 
addition to the observation of interfacial conductivity, the ability to achieve high carrier 
mobility > 105 cm V-1s-1 in 2DEG is particularly interesting in the development of all-oxide 
devices 4-5. Theoretical reports 6-8 predicted that, due to the presence of an inversion asymmetry 
at the interface, a 2DEG electron with momentum 𝑝⃗ in the presence of an electric field 𝐸ሬ⃗ can 
experience a Rashba-like field ∝𝑝⃗ൈ𝐸ሬ⃗ in its rest frame because of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)9. 
The possibility of achieving a strong Rashba SOC at these 2DEG allows compatibility with 
spintronic devices, and, therefore, has given rise to a series of experiments to understand 
magnetotransport in the 2DEG 10-20. A large number of these investigations have been focused 
on spin-charge interconversion in 2DEG formed at interfaces of epitaxial LaAlO3 (LAO) and 
LaTiO3 (LTO) films grown on single-crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) substrates 15-20. Recently, 
reports on giant room temperature charge to spin conversion efficiency, 𝜃ୡୱ as high as 6.3 in 
epitaxial LAO/STO-based 2DEG 15, implying that they are significantly more efficient than 
most heavy metals (HM) 21, topological insulators 22-23 and engineered HM 24-26 towards spin 
current generation. Such properties position the 2DEG as an interesting candidate for 
applications in future spintronic devices, such as power-efficient spin-charge current 
interconversion. 
Recent reports on high mobility in these 2DEG/amorphous oxides formed in systems 
like STO/Al2O3 interfaces have brought back attention towards 2DEG formed in such materials 
owing to their relative ease of deposition compared to their crystalline counterparts 4,27. These 
2DEG originate from oxygen vacancies in the STO side and are confined to a few nanometers 
(nm) inside the substrate surface. Broadly speaking, when a metal-based oxide/nitride, 
especially the Al-based materials, is deposited on an STO substrate, a layer of oxygen vacancies5 
is created at the surface of STO due to the redox reactions between Al-based oxide/nitride and 
STO 28- 30. Such oxygen vacancies lead to mobile electrons, producing interfacial quasi-2DEG 
(hereafter, q-2DEG) inside STO. This leads to the creation of a conductive channel inside the 
STO substrate, as schematically shown in Fig. 1(a). Such q-2DEG induced by oxygen vacancy 
have often been overlooked in earlier studies and therefore we focus on potential higher charge-
spin interconversion in these systems. Furthermore, although spin-charge current 
interconversion in 2DEG was reported at cryogenic temperatures27, a systematic analysis of 
such a phenomenon at room temperature is lacking. Previous studies have indicated that 
angular-dependent measurement of magnetization dynamics is crucial towards an accurate 
estimation of magnetic anisotropies and torques 26, 31-34. Therefore, we use such an approach to 
systematically investigate the charge-to-spin conversion efficiency of q-2DEG. 
In this study, using spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements in 
STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe systems, we show that the 𝜃ୡୱ in the q-2DEG can be as 
high as their crystalline counterparts at room temperature. Our experiments clearly show the 
presence of a symmetric component in the ST-FMR lineshape, which has an odd parity with 
the direction of the magnetic field, confirming the presence of spin-torque in the devices. In 
addition to the expected sin2𝜙cos𝜙 dependence of the symmetric and antisymmetric 
amplitudes of the ST-FMR spectra, we also detect contributions from a sin2𝜙sin𝜙-like and 
sin2𝜙-like behaviour. By filtering out the sin2𝜙cos𝜙 contributions of the ST-FMR spectra, we 
estimate 𝜃ୡୱ/𝑡= 0.244 nm-1 and 0.101 nm-1 for the STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe 
systems, respectively. Additionally, using DC-biased ST-FMR measurements, we show that 
modulation of resonant linewidth in the STO/AlN/NiFe samples is ~3 times higher than 
conventional heavy metals, i.e. Pt, directly affirming the presence of a high in-plane damping-
like spin torque arising from the q-2DEG.6 
2. Experimental details 
 
A pattern of dimension 80×20 µm2 was created on TiO2-terminated STO (100) 
substrates using photolithography, wherein 10 nm AlN or Al2O3 was deposited using pulsed 
laser deposition (PLD) at room temperature at a pressure of 10-4 Pa. The sheet resistance, Rs of 
the STO/AlN and STO/Al2O3 samples are ~90 kΩ/□. and ~103 kΩ/□, respectively. Subsequently, 
5 nm NiFe was deposited using DC sputtering on the same pattern. Finally, using aligned 
photolithography and DC sputtering, Ti (10 nm)/Al (200 nm) electrodes were deposited on 
either side of the 80×20 µm2 pattern to create the device, as shown in Fig. 1(b). See the 
supplementary information S1 for details of device fabrication. ST-FMR spectra in the devices 
were recorded using a lockin-detection technique (see Fig. 1(b)). A microwave current Irf of 
frequency f was applied in the device using a signal generator while an external magnetic field 
Hext was swept in the in-plane direction. The Hext could be rotated in-plane with respect to the 
Irf, as depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1(a) by varying the angle 𝜙 with the Irf. All 
measurements were performed at room temperature. 
 
3. Results and discussion   
Due to the SOC at the q-2DEG, a spin current is generated in q-2DEG, which flows to 
the adjacent NiFe layer and exerts a torque on its magnetization. This can lead to FMR in the 
NiFe layer. A combined effect of an alternating anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of NiFe 
and the microwave current Irf (proportional to spin current), gives the rectified DC voltage Vmix, 
which is recorded using a lock-in amplifier (Fig. 1(b)). A typical spectrum obtained from this 
measurement at a frequency of 4.0 GHz is shown in Fig. 1(c). This spectrum is then fitted with 
the sum of a symmetric Lorentzian and an antisymmetric component using the following 
equation 35.

∆ுሺு೐ೣ೟ିு೚ሻ
ሺு೐ೣ೟ିு೚ሻమାሺ௱ுሻమ,  is the antisymmetric component with weight A, and ΔH and 
H଴ are the half-width-at-half-maximum and resonance field of the FMR spectra 25,35.  From the 
fit, we obtain µoΔ𝐻= 4.34 mT for STO/AlN/NiFe and µoΔ𝐻= 1.71 mT for the STO/Al2O3/NiFe 
sample at f = 5 GHz, which indicates lower damping for the latter sample. (also see 
supplementary information S2). Meanwhile, we obtained µo𝐻଴= 38.54 mT for STO/AlN/NiFe 
and µo𝐻଴= 33.59 mT for the STO/Al2O3/NiFe sample at f= 5 GHz. Because the NiFe layers 
were deposited on both samples simultaneously, the difference in resonance field may be due 
to different effective demagnetizing fields, Meff, in the two samples (Also see the 
Supplementary information S2) 33. 
In addition, we also observed that, while the symmetric component magnitude is almost 
similar with an opposite sign with the Hext reversed, the antisymmetric component is different 
upon Hext reversal. The odd parity of the symmetric component with respect to the direction of 
the magnetic field indicates that it originates from the spin-torque generated by the q-2DEG. 
Due to the SOC at the q-2DEG, a spin current is generated transverse to the flow of microwave 
current Irf. This spin current flows from the q-2DEG to the NiFe layer and exerts a torque on 
the magnetization of NiFe, resulting in the symmetric component of the ST-FMR spectra. 
Additionally, the Irf also generates an Oersted field, hrf which can exert a field-torque on the 
magnetization of NiFe layer and give rise to the antisymmetric component of the ST-FMR 
spectra 25. In order to avoid any contributions to the rectified voltage lineshape that can arise 
from non-linear excitation of magnetization dynamics, we ensured that all our measurements 
were performed in the linear regime by checking the input power Papp dependence of the spectra 
33, 34. As power increases from 0 to 13 dBm, Δ𝐻 and 𝐻଴ remains invariant with power, as shown 
in Supplementary information S3. This confirms that the Vmix is due to the excitation of uniform8 
FMR mode in this input power range. We performed our measurements at Papp = 10 dBm (10 
mW) in order to ensure that the measurements are in the linear regime. 
 Frequency-dependent measurements of the ST-FMR spectra in the range of 3.5 - 5 GHz 
for the STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples were performed (see Fig. 2). Throughout 
the frequency range, we observed a similar behaviour of the symmetric and antisymmetric 
components of the ST-FMR spectra for both samples as described in the previous paragraph. 
The amplitude of the spectra decreases at a higher frequency. The resonance field, Ho increases 
increasing frequency, which in turn leads to a lower precession cone angle at higher Hext. 
Additionally, the Ho increases with the frequency, which agrees well with the Kittel equation. 
Upon fitting to the Kittel equation 34, we obtained µoMeff = 698 mT and 814 mT for the 
STO/AlN/NiFe and the STO/ Al2O3/NiFe samples, respectively (see Supplementary 
information S2). This confirms that the difference in resonance fields in STO/AlN/NiFe and 
STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples arises from the different effective demagnetizing fields 34. 
When the symmetric component of the ST-FMR spectra is attributed to a y-polarized 
spin current, 𝜎ො௬ travelling in the z-direction, the angular dependence of the symmetric 
amplitude follows a sin2𝜙cos𝜙 dependence. Simultaneously, due to the flow of an x-axial 
microwave current in the device, an antisymmetric component is also produced by the 
corresponding Oersted field, which follows a sin2𝜙cos𝜙 dependence. In this scenario, the 𝜃ୡୱ 
can be estimated using 35:

where t is the q-2DEG thickness, e is the elementary charge, μ୭ is the permeability of free space, 
𝑀ୗ is the saturation magnetization of NiFe, d is NiFe thickness, ħ is the reduced Planck constant 
and Meff is effective magnetization obtained from the Kittel fitting. The corresponding angular 
dependent components of voltages in the STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples are9 
plotted in Fig. 3(a) and 3(c), respectively. The symmetric component is fitted to the following 
equation (see Supplementary information S4 for details): 
Vୱൌa sin2𝜙cos𝜙൅b sin𝜙sin2𝜙,     (3) 
where a  is the weightage of the sin2𝜙cos𝜙 component and b  is the weightage of the 
sin𝜙sin2𝜙 component. Meanwhile, the antisymmetric component is fitted to: 
V୅ൌc sin2𝜙𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜙൅d sinϕ𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜙 ൅é sin2𝜙,     (4) 
where c, d and é are the weights of the sin2𝜙cos𝜙, sin𝜙sin2𝜙 and sin2𝜙 components, 
respectively. We note that, in our devices, the angular dependence of symmetric and 
antisymmetric components is not purely sin2𝜙cos𝜙. Figures 3(b) and 3(d) show the weightage 
of the different symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the spectra for f = 3.5-5 GHz in the case 
of the STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples, respectively. For STO/AlN/NiFe, the 
symmetric component has a 95.3% sin2𝜙cos𝜙 dependence, with the rest 4.7% arising from a 
sin2𝜙sin𝜙 dependence when averaged over the entire frequency range. Meanwhile, its 
antisymmetric component has an average of 49.5%, 22.5% and 28.0% contributions from a 
sin2𝜙cos𝜙, sin2𝜙sin𝜙 and sin2𝜙dependence, respectively. In the case of the 
STO/Al2O3/NiFe, we find that the symmetric component has 75.5% sin2𝜙cos𝜙 dependence 
and 24.5% sin2𝜙sin𝜙 dependence averaged over the entire frequency range. On the other hand, 
its antisymmetric component has an average of 55.7%, 16.4% and 27.9% contributions from 
sin2𝜙cos𝜙, sin2𝜙sin𝜙 and sin2𝜙 dependences, respectively. This indicates breaking of the 
twofold (180°+𝜙) and mirror (180°-𝜙ሻ symmetries of torques for both the q-2DEG-NiFe 
samples. Therefore the lineshape analysis method, i.e., Eq. (2), which uses a spectrum obtained 
at a single azimuthal angle 𝜙, may not reveal the comprehensive picture of torques, leading to 
inaccurate quantification of SOTs 36.  
Although an investigation into the exact origins of these additional components in the 
ST-FMR spectra is beyond the scope of this article, we would like to emphasize that we 
reproducibly observed this behaviour in multiple devices over a wide range of frequencies. This10 
may be a consequence of non-uniform microwave current flow in devices.  In order to rule out 
the possibility that it is caused by our device design, we further verified the same experiments 
in a Pt/NiFe device fabricated under similar conditions and found 100% sin2𝜙cos𝜙  
dependence for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of the ST-FMR spectra (see 
Supplementary information S5). NiFe has a much lower resistivity compared to the q-2DEG 
created at the STO/AlN interface. This may lead to non-uniform current flow in the q-2DEG-
NiFe device, giving rise to the additional angular-dependent components in the ST-FMR 
spectra for the STO/AlN/NiFe sample. It is noteworthy that the sin2𝜙cos𝜙 contribution 
reduces for both the symmetric and antisymmetric components in the case of STO/Al2O3/NiFe 
samples, whose 2DEG has ~10 times higher sheet resistance compared to that of 
STO/AlN/NiFe samples. 
 Before we proceed to the estimation of 𝜃ୡୱ, it should be noted that 𝜃ୡୱ is directly 
proportional to the thickness of the q-2DEG. Therefore, without a direct measurement of the 
2DEG thickness, we may end up with overestimated values of 𝜃ୡୱ. In order to avoid such a 
discrepancy in our study, we estimate the q-2DEG thickness normalized conversion efficiency 
as seen from Eq. (5) below. Additionally, to estimate the 𝜃ୡୱ corresponding to the dominant y-
polarized spin current, 𝜎ො௬ in the samples, we introduce a ratio a/c, where a and c are weight 
percentages of the sin2𝜙cos𝜙 component of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts at a 
specific frequency mentioned earlier. This allows us to rewrite Eq. (2) as follows:

Using Eq. (5), we estimated the median 𝜃௖௦/𝑡 to be 0.244 nm-1 for the STO/AlN sample and 
0.101 nm-1 for the STO/Al2O3 sample. The frequency dependence of 𝜃௖௦/𝑡 is shown in Fig. 4. 
The values of 𝜃௖௦/𝑡 estimated using Eq. (2) are also plotted in the same figure to show the 
discrepancy between the two methods. Note that such a discrepancy is not seen for the Pt/NiFe 
devices (see Supplementary information S5).11 
As mentioned earlier, the calculated values in our case are normalized by the 2DEG 
thickness. Typically, in previous reports, the 2DEG thickness is assumed to be 10 nm, and a 𝜃ୡୱ 
~ 1.8 at room temperature has been reported for STO/LaAlO3/NiFe 20, 𝜃ୡୱ ~ 2.4 for quasi-2DEG 
in an STO/LaTiO3/NiFe system 18 and 𝜃ୡୱ ~ 6.3 for STO/LaAlO3/CoFeB 15. In our case, if we 
assume the 2DEG thickness, t = 10 nm, the 𝜃ୡୱ comes out to be 2.44 for the STO/AlN/NiFe and 
1.01 for STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples. These values are comparable to previous reports on 2DEG 
formed in epitaxial oxides grown on STO substrates. Note that the AlN and Al2O3 layers are 
amorphous in our case. Hence, the 𝜃ୡୱ created at the q-2DEG in our STO/amorphous oxide 
interfaces are shown to be comparable in terms of charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies with 
the 2DEG reported for the epitaxial oxides on STO. Moreover, the 𝜃ୡୱ in our sample is 1 or 2 
orders of magnitude higher than that of HM, such as Pt 37, Ta 21, W 38, and also than engineered 
HM 24-26. As seen from the sheet resistance values, the q-2DEG in STO/AlN has 1 order smaller 
resistance values compared to STO/Al2O3. This indicates that when AlN is deposited over STO 
substrates, higher number of O2- diffuse outward from the substrate to oxidize AlN compared 
to when Al2O3 is deposited. This in turn creates a larger number of oxygen defects inside the 
STO substrate. As demonstrated by Chen et al., this difference in diffusion may have to do with 
the difference in chemical reactivity of AlN and Al2O3 with TiO2-terminated STO28. Our 
observation of a higher charge-to-spin conversion in the STO/AlN samples indicates that the 
higher oxygen vacancies not only play a role in enhancing the electronic transport, but may also 
lead to a higher charge-to-spin conversion efficiency in the q-2DEG. 
The modulation of damping of FMR can also be an additional tool to overcome the 
issues with 𝜃ୡୱ estimation mentioned in this paper as it provides a direct insight into the strength 
of damping-like spin torques. This is free from problems arising from impedance mismatch, 
unconventional spin current polarized in different directions, and Nernst heating 35. In this 
method, an additional direct current (DC) Idc is applied along with Irf. The spin current at the 
Rashba interface, which is proportional to Idc, modulates the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth12 
(or the Gilbert damping) 35 of NiFe via damping-like torque which has an odd polarity with Idc. 
By measuring the change in linewidth as a function of Idc, the 𝜃ୡୱ  can be evaluated if the 
thickness of the q-2DEG is known. Therefore, we performed the Idc-biased ST-FMR 
measurement on the STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples by applying an Idc ~ േ 7mA 
along with Irf. The data at f = 5 GHz is shown in Fig. 5 (a) and 5(b). For the STO/AlN/NiFe, we 
observe a linear modulation of Δ𝐻 with Idc. Upon changing the polarity of Idc, we observe a 
reversed slope of Δ𝐻 vs Idc (see Fig. 5(a) and Supplementary information S6). This confirms 
the presence of dominant damping-like torque in STO/AlN/NiFe. The slope of linewidth 
modulation for STO/AlN/NiFe is ~3 times higher than the modulation seen for the Pt/NiFe 
samples as seen in Fig. 5(a) and 5(c). Due to a much lower resistivity of Pt, it implies that 𝜃ୡୱ  
for STO/AlN/NiFe will be ~1-2 orders higher compared to Pt/NiFe. However, we are unable to 
quantify 𝜃ୡୱ beyond its qualitative discussion since an accurate measure of q-2DEG resistivity 
is paramount for quantifying 𝜃ୡୱ  from this measurement, and we do not know the exact 
thickness of q-2DEG. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 5(b), we are unable to detect any linear 
modulation in linewidth for STO/Al2O3/NiFe. This is due to a significantly higher sheet 
resistance of the q-2DEG in STO/Al2O3, which results in very little current through its q-2DEG 
and difficulty in detecting any linear modulation of Δ𝐻 by Idc. Instead, we obtain the 
dependence of Δ𝐻 vs Idc shown in Fig. 5(b), which can be attributed to the dominance of the 
heating effect over modulation of damping in the sample. An increase of Ho with increasing Idc 
magnitude in STO/Al2O3/NiFe samples confirms the heating effect 22. Notably, the Ho does not 
change with Idc in either STO/AlN/NiFe or Pt/NiFe (see Supplementary information S7). 
In summary, we report a large charge to spin conversion efficiency 𝜃ୡୱ at room 
temperature in 2DEG formed at the interface of amorphous AlN and Al2O3 with SrTiO3 
substrate. Previous reports on spin-charge interconversion have been reported for 2DEG formed 
in epitaxial thin films at room temperature 15-20 and amorphous oxide/STO substrates in 2DEG 
at cryogenic temperatures 27, which arises from the spin-momentum locking at Rashba13 
interfaces lacking inversion symmetry. From angular-dependent ST-FMR measurements in our 
q-2DEG-NiFe samples, we observe the breaking of two-fold and mirror symmetry of spin-
torques which may be due to non-uniform microwave current flow in the high impedance q-
2DEG. Our estimation of 𝜃ୡୱ/t ~ 0.244 nm-1 in STO/AlN and ~ 0.101 nm-1 in STO/Al2O3, 
comparable to that of epitaxial films is important because of the relative ease with which 
amorphous films can provide added functionalities in 2DEG applications 4,28-30. Moreover, a 
large direct current modulation of linewidth for STO/AlN provides direct confirmation of high 
𝜃ୡୱ in our q-2DEG.  The similarity between our amorphous and crystalline oxide interfaces in 
terms of charge density and conductivity along with the charge-to-spin conversion may provide 
insight into the microscopic mechanisms and further optimization of the conversion efficiencies. 
An ability to efficiently generate spin current from q-2DEG, while simultaneously 
understanding their angular dependent properties that shed light on the directionality of spin 
torques, is crucial for their implementation in spintronic device applications.14

Figure Captions: 
Figure  1. (a) Schematic of q-2DEG formed inside the STO substrate at the interface with AlN 
or Al2O3. Upon deposition of AlN or Al2O3, the O2- diffuses outwards from the TiO2-terminated 
STO, resulting in formation of a oxygen-vacancy induced quasi-2DEG (q-2DEG) near the 
surface of STO.The right panel additionally shows the multilayer structures and different 
parameters used in the measurement. (b) Schematic of ST-FMR set-up along with an optical 
image of the device. (c) ST-FMR spectra Vmix, together with fitted symmetric and antisymmetric 
components, which were obtained at f = 4 GHz for STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe. 
 
Figure  2. Frequency-dependent ST-FMR spectra, for f = 3.5-5 GHz, as a function of Hext, for 
(a) STO/AlN/NiFe and (b) STO/Al2O3/NiFe.  
 
Figure 3. Angular dependence of symmetric (Sym) and antisymmetric (Asym) components in 
ST-FMR spectra obtained as a function of 𝜙 for (a) STO/AlN/NiFe, and (c) STO/Al2O3/NiFe 
for f = 4.0 GHz with solid lines (black and red) fit by Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively. Weight 
(in %) of sin2𝜙cos𝜙 and sin2𝜙sin𝜙 for Symmetric (Sym) and  sin2𝜙cos𝜙, sin2𝜙sin𝜙,  sin2𝜙 
for Antisymmetric (Asym) components are obtained as a function of f for (b) STO/AlN/NiFe 
and (d) STO/Al2O3/NiFe. 
 
Figure  4. Thickness normalized charge to spin conversion efficiency 𝜃ୡୱ/𝑡 obtained from Eq. 
(2) and Eq. (5) as a function of f for STO/AlN/NiFe and STO/Al2O3/NiFe. 
 
Figure 5. DC-biased ST-FMR measurements for (a) STO/AlN/NiFe (b) STO/Al2O3/NiFe, and 
(c) Pt/NiFe showing  μ୭𝛥𝐻 as a function of Idc. The red and black lines depict the linear fitting 
in (a), (c) and non-linear curve in (b).20
