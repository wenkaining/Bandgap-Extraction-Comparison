We
theoretically
study
the
tunnel
magnetoresistance
(TMR)
effect
in
(111)-oriented
junctions
Co/MgO/Co(111) and Ni/MgO/Ni(111). The Co-based junction is shown to have a TMR ratio over 2000%,
which is one order higher than that of the Ni-based one. The high TMR ratio is attributed to the interfacial
resonance effect: The interfacial d-p antibonding states are formed close to the Fermi level in the majority-spin
channel and these states in both interfaces resonate with each other. This differs essentially from the conventional
coherent tunneling mechanism of high TMR ratios in Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001).

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the observation of the giant tunnel magnetoresis-
tance (TMR) effect in Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001) magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs) [1,2], the TMR effect has long been
explained by the coherent tunneling mechanism [3,4]: Bulk
wave functions of the ferromagnetic electrode are selectively
ﬁltered by the MgO barrier and only the 1 wave function
with half metallicity at the Fermi level passes through the
barrier, leading to the high TMR ratio [Fig. 1(a)]. However,
there is a signiﬁcant discrepancy in the TMR ratio between the
theory and experiments; the highest TMR ratio observed so
far is around 500% at low temperature [5], but is about half of
the theoretically predicted value over 1000% [3,4]. A possible
key to understand this gap is interfacial effects. Several studies
[6,7] have indicated the importance of interfacial states for
explaining temperature dependencies of TMR ratios [8]. In
the (001)-oriented MTJs, the interfacial states are formed in
the minority-spin state [3,9] and tend to decrease the TMR
ratio [10].
These
motivate
us
to
speculate
that
interfacial
states provide signiﬁcant contribution to TMR effects
in real experiments and decrease the TMR ratios in
Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001)
MTJs.
In
contrast,
we
can
utilize such interfacial states for enhancing the TMR effect
signiﬁcantly; this study proposes a quite high TMR ratio
driven by the interfacial resonance effect in an unconventional
(111)-oriented MTJ.
In the present work, we theoretically examine the TMR
effect in two basic (111)-oriented MTJs, Co/MgO/Co(111)
[Fig. 1(b)] and Ni/MgO/Ni(111), where (111) directions of
the MgO barrier and ferromagnetic electrodes (fcc Co or fcc
Ni) are parallel to the stacking direction of the MTJ. It is
natural to consider such (111)-oriented MTJs for fcc ferro-
magnetic electrodes because the close-packed (111) plane has
the lowest surface energy in the fcc lattice [11]. However,
TMR effects in these MTJs have not been understood well,
since most previous studies have focused on (001)-oriented
MTJs with bcc ferromagnetic electrodes. We calculate con-
ductances and TMR ratios of the (111)-oriented MTJs by
means of the ﬁrst-principles approach combining the density-
functional theory (DFT) and the Landauer formula. It is shown
that the obtained TMR ratio of the Co-based MTJ is quite
high (∼2100%) while that of the Ni-based one is relatively
low (∼250%). From the in-plane wave-vector dependencies
of the conductances, we ﬁnd that the TMR effect in the
(111)-oriented MTJs cannot be understood from the bulk band
structures of the barrier and electrodes, which is essentially
different from the case of the (001)-oriented MTJs. Detailed
analyses of the local electronic structure and the transmittance
clarify that the resonance of the interfacial d-p antibonding
states in the majority-spin channel is the origin of the high
TMR ratio in the Co-based (111)-oriented MTJ.
II. CALCULATION METHOD
We
prepared
supercells
of
Co/MgO/Co(111)
and
Ni/MgO/Ni(111) as shown in Fig. 1(b). The a- and b-axis
lengths were ﬁxed to a = afcc/
√
2 and b =
√
3 afcc/
√
2,
where we used afcc = 3.52 Å for both the supercells. In
the Co-based (Ni-based) supercell, we chose the Co-O
(Ni-O) interface, which is energetically favored compared
to the Co-Mg (Ni-Mg) one. The atomic positions along
the c direction in the supercells were relaxed using the
ﬁrst-principles DFT calculation implemented in the Vienna
ab initio simulation program (VASP) [12]. Here, we adopted
the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[13] for the exchange-correlation energy and used the
projector augmented wave pseudopotential [14,15] to treat
the effect of core electrons properly. A cutoff energy of
500 eV was employed and the Brillouin-zone integration was
performed with the 23 × 13 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point
grid. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set
to 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV/Å, respectively. More details of our
structure optimization are given in our previous work [16].

Using the optimized supercell, we constructed quantum
open systems by attaching the left and right semi-inﬁnite
electrodes of Co (Ni) to the Co-based (Ni-based) supercell.
In each quantum open system, we calculated conductances
for both parallel and antiparallel conﬁgurations of magne-
tization in the electrodes using the PWCOND code [17] in
the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [18]. First, we obtained
the self-consistent potential of the quantum open system,
where the GGA and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used
for the DFT calculation. The cutoff energies for the wave
functions and the charge density were ﬁxed to 45 and 450
Ry, respectively. The 23 × 13 × 1 k points were used for the
Brillouin-zone integration and the convergence criterion was
set to 10−6 Ry. Since our systems are repeated periodically in
the xy plane, the scattering states can be classiﬁed by an in-
plane wave vector k∥= (kx, ky). For each k∥and spin index,
we solved the scattering equation derived under the condition
that the wave function and its derivative of the supercell are
connected to those of the electrodes [17,19]. These calcula-
tions and the Landauer formula give the wave-vector-resolved
conductances GP,↑(k∥), GP,↓(k∥), GAP,↑(k∥), and GAP,↓(k∥),
which are the majority- and minority-spin conductances in
the parallel and antiparallel conﬁgurations of magnetizations,
respectively. The averaged conductances are obtained as, e.g.,
GP,↑= 
k∥GP,↑(k∥)/N, where N is the sampling number of
k∥points. In the present study, N was set to 2500 ensuring
good convergence for the conductances. Using the averaged
conductances, we calculated TMR ratio (%) = 100 × (GP −
GAP)/GAP, where GP(AP) = GP(AP),↑+ GP(AP),↓.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table I shows conductances and TMR ratios obtained
in our calculations. In the Co-based MTJ, the parallel
conductance GP is much larger than the antiparallel one GAP,
leading to a quite high TMR ratio of more than 2000%.
On the other hand, the Ni-based MTJ has a smaller TMR

ratio of 250% since the difference between GP and GAP is
smaller compared to the Co-based case. One may think that
the mechanism of such TMR effects is similar to that in
the (001)-oriented MTJs. Previous theoretical studies [3,4]
have shown that the TMR effect in Fe/MgO/Fe(001) is
dominated by the bulk band structures of Fe and MgO
along the  line corresponding to the (001) direction;
in their results, GP,↑(k∥) mainly contributing to the high
TMR ratio has a sharp peak at k∥= (0, 0) = . If the
similar mechanism holds for the (111)-oriented MTJs, the
TMR effect should be explained by the band structures
along the  line corresponding to the (111) direction. In
this case, GP,↑(k∥) or GP,↓(k∥) or both of them should
have a large value at k∥= , since the  line is equiv-
alent to the kz line at k∥=  in the present supercells
[Fig. 1(b)].
To see whether or not this scenario is valid, we analyzed
the in-plane wave vector k∥= (kx, ky) dependencies of the
conductances as shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows the
majority-spin conductance GP,↑(k∥) in the Co-based MTJ
playing the key role for the obtained high TMR ratio. We
see that the conductance at k∥=  is much smaller than that
around k∥= , which is clearly different from the features
expected from the above-mentioned mechanism. Figures 2(b)
and 2(c) show the minority-spin and antiparallel conductances
[GP,↓(k∥) and GAP,↑(k∥)] in the Co-based MTJ [20], which
also do not have a signiﬁcant value at k∥=  and their
values spread more widely in the k∥Brillouin zone than
GP,↑(k∥). In Figs. 2(d)–2(f), we show the k∥dependencies
of the conductances in the Ni-based MTJ. Although detailed
features are different from those in the Co-based MTJ, the
conductances also do not have a signiﬁcant value at k∥= .
All these results indicate that the TMR effect in the (111)-
oriented MTJs cannot be explained by the bulk band structures
of the barrier and electrodes along the  line, in sharp contrast
to the previous results on the (001)-oriented MTJs [3,4]. We
also analyzed bulk band structures of fcc Co, Ni, and MgO
along the  line, which revealed that, although the complex
band of MgO(111) consists of the 1 state, both Co and
Ni do not have a half metallicity in the 1 state. This also
suggests the inapplicability of the explanation based on bulk
band structures.
To obtain further insight into the role of the MgO
barrier,
we
additionally
analyzed
the
TMR
effect
in
Co/vacuum/Co(111), where the distance between the left and
right interfaces and all the positions of Co atoms were set
to be the same as those of Co/MgO/Co(111). We obtained

a TMR ratio of 320%, which is one order lower than that
of Co/MgO/Co(111). This clearly indicates the necessity of
MgO to achieve a high TMR ratio. From the comparison
of the k∥-resolved conductances between the vacuum and
MgO cases, we found that MgO particularly damps the wave
functions that are distributed away from k∥= .
Interfacial effects are the key to understand the present
TMR effect. As shown in Figs. 2(a)–2(f), the conductances
have signiﬁcant values in a set of k∥points surrounding
k∥= . This reminds us of the existence of the inter-
facial resonance effect. Examples showing this effect are
Fe/MgO/Fe(001) [3,21–23], Co/MgO/Co(001) [24], and
FeCo/MgO/FeCo(001) [24], which have interfacial states
close to the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. Such
states in the left and right interfaces resonate with each other
and provide non-negligible values of GP,↓(k∥) in the k∥points
surrounding . Furthermore, additional transport between the
interfacial minority-spin states and the bulk majority-spin 1
state enhance GAP,↑(k∥) and GAP,↓(k∥). Thus, the interfacial
states itself tend to decrease the TMR ratio in the (001)-
oriented MTJ. However, since GP,↑(k∥) has a quite large value
at k∥=  based on the coherent tunneling mechanism [3,4],
the interfacial effect provides a small contribution to the TMR
ratio. Note that these are the previous theoretical results; the
interfacial effect is sensitive to the interfacial conditions in
real experiments [21].
To conﬁrm the existence of interfacial states in the present
MTJs, we show in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) the projected LDOSs

of interfacial Co and O atoms in the Co/MgO/Co(111)
MTJ. In Fig. 3(b), we see that the interfacial O atoms have
peaks of the majority-spin LDOSs in the px and py orbitals
close to the Fermi level (EF), which originates from the
antibonding between Co dzx (dyz) and O px (py) states at the
interface. As mentioned below, such interfacial antibonding
states mainly contribute to the high TMR ratio through the
interfacial resonance effect. It should be emphasized that these
majority-spin interfacial states enhance GP,↑(k∥) but hardly
enhance GAP,↑(k∥) and GAP,↓(k∥), which is because the bulk
minority-spin state is not signiﬁcant in the (111)-oriented
MTJ. This is clearly different from the (001)-oriented case
and the reason why we obtained the large TMR ratio in this
MTJ. In the case of the Ni/MgO/Ni(111) MTJ [Figs. 3(c)
and 3(d)], on the other hand, the interfacial antibonding state
between Ni dzx (dyz) and O px (py) states is formed at a lower
energy compared to the Co-based case, which is owing to the
difference in the valence electron number between Co and Ni.
Thus, the interfacial O atoms have small majority-spin LDOSs
in the px and py orbitals at E = EF.

orbital has an almost the same k∥dependence as that in the
O px orbital in each spin state [e.g., Figs. 4(a) and 4(c)],
since these orbitals make an antibonding state around E = EF
as mentioned above. The same relation holds between the
LDOSs of Co (Ni) dyz and O py orbitals [e.g., Figs. 4(b) and
4(d)]. Of particular importance is that the k∥dependencies
of the conductances in Fig. 2 can be understood by those
of the LDOSs in Fig. 4. In fact, GP,↑(k∥) in the Co-based
MTJ [Fig. 2(a)] can be almost reproduced by mixing the k∥
dependencies of majority-spin LDOSs in the O px (Co dzx)
and O py (Co dyz) states [Figs. 4(a)–4(d)]. The minority-
spin conductance GP,↓(k∥) [Fig. 2(b)] also reﬂects minority-
spin LDOSs in the O px (Co dzx) and O py (Co dyz) states
[Figs. 4(e)–4(h)]. In a similar way, we can explain the k∥
dependencies of the conductances [Figs. 2(d)–2(f)] by those of
the LDOSs [Figs. 4(i)–4(p)] in the case of Ni/MgO/Ni(111);
e.g., GP,↓(k∥) [Fig. 2(e)] has a similar k∥dependence to the
minority-spin LDOSs in the Ni dzx and O px states [Figs. 4(m)
and 4(o)]. All these results clearly suggest that the interfacial
antibonding states at E ≈EF provide the TMR effect in the
(111)-oriented MTJs through the interfacial resonance effect.
Further evidence for the interfacial resonance effect is
obtained from the energy dependence of the transmittance.

at E = EF. In Fig. 5, we can see sharp peaks close to EF,
which are similar to those previously obtained in the minority-
spin transmittance in the Fe/MgO/Fe(001) MTJ exhibiting
the interfacial resonance effect [21–23]. Since the resonance
effect usually occurs in a narrow energy range, such a charac-
teristic energy dependence of the transmittance is concluded
to originate from the interfacial resonance effect. On the other
hand, when a ﬁnite bias voltage (∼0.05 V) is applied to the
MTJ, the interfacial resonance could be removed owing to its
small energy width [21,25], leading to the reduction of the
TMR ratio. However, we have many other interfacial states
around EF as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Thus, if we increase
the bias voltage further, these interfacial states may form a
new resonance and enhance the TMR ratio [21].
Some previous studies have provided partial informa-
tion on (111)-oriented MTJs. Hauch et al. [26] fabricated
an Fe(110)/MgO(111)/Fe(110) MTJ with the (111)-oriented
MgO barrier and observed a low TMR ratio of 54% at
low temperature. They attributed the low TMR ratio to
the imperfect spin ﬁltering in the 1 state. Belashchenko
et al. [27] theoretically analyzed Co/Al2O3/Co(111) MTJs.
Although they revealed the sensitivity of the current spin
polarization to the interfacial atomic conﬁguration, the ob-
tained TMR ratios were quite low (∼60%). In the present
work, by focusing on simpler (111)-oriented MTJs and car-
rying out detailed analyses on local electronic structures, we
found a quite high TMR ratio and clariﬁed its underlying
mechanism.
IV. SUMMARY
We theoretically investigated the TMR effect in un-
conventional (111)-oriented MTJs, Co/MgO/Co(111) and
Ni/MgO/Ni(111). By estimating their transport properties
using the ﬁrst-principles-based approach, we found that the
Co-based MTJ has a TMR ratio over 2000%, which is much
higher than that of the Ni-based one of 250%. The anal-
yses of the LDOSs and the transmittance showed that the
obtained high TMR ratio comes from the resonance of the
interfacial d-p antibonding states in the majority-spin chan-
nel. This mechanism is essentially different from that in the
Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001) MTJ and suggests a novel way to
achieve a giant TMR ratio.
