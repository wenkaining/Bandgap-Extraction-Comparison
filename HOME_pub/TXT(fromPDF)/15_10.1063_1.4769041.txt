We demonstrate a solar cell that uses ﬁxed negative charges formed at the interface of n-Si with
Al2O3 to generate strong inversion at the surface of n-Si by electrostatic repulsion. Built-in
voltages of up to 755 mV are found at this interface. In order to harness this large built-in voltage,
we present a photovoltaic device where the photocurrent generated in this inversion layer is
extracted via an inversion layer induced by a high work function transparent organic top contact,
deposited on top of a passivating and dipole-inducing molecular monolayer. Results of the effect of
the molecular monolayer on device performance yield open-circuit voltages of up to 550 mV for
moderately doped Si, demonstrating the effectiveness of this contact structure in removing the
Fermi level pinning that has hindered past efforts in developing this type of solar cell with n-type
Si. V

The standard process for producing commercial silicon
solar cells is highly energy intensive, requiring about 1.5 GJ
per panel to produce polycrystalline panels of area 0.65 m2.1
A major hindrance to reducing the cost of silicon solar cells
is the high temperature dopant diffusion step in forming the
emitter. In addition to the large amount of energy required to
maintain a temperature of 900 C for multiple hours, in order
to diffuse dopants from the surface into a Si wafer, such high
temperature requirements preclude the use of inexpensive
methods of forming the Si base using substrates such as glass
or metal foils. Inversion layer solar cells circumvent this
high temperature step by replacing the conventional doped
p-n junction with a p-n junction induced in the top region
of the substrate, using low temperature surface treatments
alone.
An inversion layer can be formed by contacting an
n-(p-)type semiconductor with a high (low) work function
metal, forming a Schottky barrier that is high enough so that
minority carriers become dominant in a narrow layer at the
surface. This occurs at a built-in voltage of Vbi > (EG/2
 jEC-EFj), for an n-type semiconductor in contact with a
high work function metal, where EG is the semiconductor
band gap energy and EC is the conduction band edge energy.
This effectively forms a p-n homojunction, while avoiding
the energy-intensive processing steps, involved in doping. If
the Schottky barrier is high enough that the carrier concen-
tration in the inversion layer exceeds the dopant density, the
junction is in strong inversion, and generally exhibits higher
mobility due to improved screening of impurities. In prac-
tice, however, for Si and other covalent semiconductors,
Fermi level pinning limits the actual barrier height of these
types of devices, unless adequate surface passivation can be
provided.2
Instead of using a metallic top contact to generate inver-
sion in Si, ﬁxed charges held at the interface of Si with a
dielectric, such as Al2O3 or SiOx, can generate inversion by
electrostatic repulsion, if the majority carrier type of the Si
substrate is of the same sign as the ﬁxed charge at the inter-
face, and if the density of ﬁxed charges is high enough. This
reduces the impact of Fermi level pinning by taking advant-
age of dielectrics that also passivate the Si surface. The most
effective solar cells based on this concept were made in the
SiO–p-Si system, where positive ﬁxed charges at the Si-SiO
interface generate inversion near the surface of the Si sub-
strate. Devices made from thin SiO layers on p-Si, using
thin-oxide tunnel junction contacts, reached 16.8% efﬁciency
(active area), for Czochralski-grown substrates, implying
12.6% total device area efﬁciency, given the reported 25%
shading.3 The interface between Al2O3 and Si contains up to
1013 cm3 ﬁxed negative charges, an order of magnitude
higher than the positive charge density found at the SiO/Si
interface,4,5 which lead to ﬁeld effect passivation in p-type
and inversion in n-type Si.5,6 The higher charge density at
this interface should lead to stronger inversion than that found
in the previously investigated SiO-Si system, and potentially,
also to better device performance. However, making contact
to such a device using an n-Si/oxide/metal junction, as was
used in the p-Si/SiO system described above,3 will not work
as well, due to the low open circuit voltages typically found
for metal-insulator-n-Si solar cells.7,8 For this reason, n-Si
inversion layer solar cells have not been extensively studied
in the literature. Instead, metal-Si junctions, where the Si
surface has been modiﬁed and passivated by a molecular
monolayer (MM) to suppress Fermi level pinning, show more
promise in generating the high Voc needed for these devices,
while maintaining the desired low processing temperatures.9
In this letter, we demonstrate inversion layer solar cells
based on the negatively charged interface between Al2O3
and n-Si. Figure 1(a) shows a proposed band diagram of this
interface (adapted from Ref. 6). We show that the negative
ﬁxed charge density leads to a built-in voltage (Vbi) of up to
755 mV, more than sufﬁcient to reach strong inversion for a
substrate donor concentration, ND, less than 5  1016 cm3.
As a thickness of at least 10–15 nm Al2O3 is required to
achieve a high interface charge density,5 contact points to
extract carriers must be etched through the Al2O3, which nat-
urally removes inversion at the point of contact. A selective
contact must then be formed, in order to avoid shorting to

dopants at the contacts, which would create a conventional
doped p-n junction at the contact. However, the same high
temperatures we seek to avoid would be required for this
step. Instead, we use a high work function top contact to gen-
erate inversion with room temperature processing. To remove
Fermi level pinning, we ﬁrst deposit a MM of a strongly
electron-donating molecule, ethylene toluene, to provide
electronic passivation, as well as to introduce a dipole that
can modify the electron afﬁnity of the underlying Si, to
increase the Schottky barrier height.9,10 We then apply the or-
ganic conductor poly(ethylenedioxy thiophene):poly(styrene-
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a high work function top contact,
using a soft-deposition method that preserves the MM. We
show that this contact structure leads to strong inversion for a
substrate donor concentration, ND < 1015 cm3, though Vbi in
this conﬁguration is 50–100 mV lower than that under the
Al2O3 interface, and demonstrate the impact of the dipole-
inducing MM at this interface on device performance.
The device structure is diagrammed in Figure 1(b). In
this conﬁguration, under illumination, electron-hole pairs are
primarily generated underneath the strong inversion layer
created by the Al2O3–n-Si interface and separated by the
large Vbi, present in this region. The hole is then transported
through
the
inversion
layer
to
the
MM-passivated
PEDOT:PSS contact, while the electron reaches the back
contact via the Si substrate. Using this technique to create a
p-n homojunction in n-Si, while maintaining processing tem-
perature below 450 C, we reach a best total area power con-
version efﬁciency of 8.4%, with an average over 6 devices of
7.9(4)%. The lowering of required temperatures allows
cheaper substrates to be used, making this method compati-
ble with recent developments in forming inexpensive thin-
ﬁlm Si on glass substrates,11 in addition to lowering the total
amount of energy required to form the emitter. In this letter,
single crystal Si is used as a model system, to better charac-
terize the relevant interfaces and the resulting device per-
formance trends.
Aluminum oxide was deposited by plasma-enhanced
atomic layer deposition (PEALD) in a Cambridge NanoTech
Fiji F200 system at a substrate temperature of 250 C on
400–500 lm thick, single side polished, (111) oriented,
P-doped n-type, Czochralski-grown single crystal Si wafers
that had been thoroughly degreased and etched to leave a
clean, smooth, and electronically well-passivated Si-H sur-
face. The sample was then annealed for 30 min at 425 C,
to reduce the interface trap density.12 Film thickness was
measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry, and conﬁrmed by
TEM, where a 3 nm layer of SiOx was found at the interface
of Si with Al2O3, typical for these deposition conditions.5
Contact ﬁngers of width 15 lm and spacing 50–150 lm, with
a total device area 0.5 cm  0.5 cm, were patterned by photo-
lithography onto the Al2O3 ﬁlms, and the exposed Al2O3
was then etched away. A MM of ethylene toluene was depos-
ited by a method described elsewhere,10 using ethynyl tolu-
ene as a molecular precursor, to passivate the exposed Si
surface before depositing the top contact. The processing
required for MM deposition resulted in a reduction of the
Al2O3 thickness from 40 nm to 25 nm, due to etching steps
used to prepare at the contacts the Si-H surface that is
required to achieve a high quality MM. The presence of
Al2O3 in these devices required a reduction in etching time
from the optimal 15 min10 to 2 min, to preserve the quality
of the Al2O3 layer, a change that was found to affect device
performance, as described below. MM characterization is
described in Ref. 10. A 200 nm thick ﬁlm of PEDOT:PSS
(Pedot P, H. C. Starck), doped with 5% ethylene glycol and
0.4% zonyl surfactant was deposited by spin-coating onto a
sacriﬁcial glass substrate and annealed for 30 min at 150 C
in a nitrogen environment. This ﬁlm was then deposited onto
the device by the lift-off-ﬂoat-on (LOFO) method,13,14 pre-
venting exposure of the MM to the acidic, aqueous
PEDOT:PSS solution. Devices made by similar methods but
with direct deposition of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS were not
as efﬁcient. A 200 nm thick Ag collection grid, contributing
15% shading, was deposited by e-beam evaporation, and
In-Ga eutectic was used as the back contact. Photovoltaic
performance was evaluated using two-probe I-V techniques,
with a 100 mW/cm2 W-halogen lamp, calibrated using a
commercial silicon diode. Two of the best devices were also
measured under a solar simulator to verify the efﬁciency. A
3% increase in the short circuit current was found, relative to
the halogen lamp, and is likely due to improved transparency
of PEDOT:PSS in the UV, where the actual solar spectrum is
stronger than that of the halogen lamp.
The inversion layer formed by the Al2O3–n-type Si inter-
face was characterized on Si with a 30 nm thick Al2O3 layer,
by capacitance-voltage (C-V) proﬁling and by Kelvin probe
surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements. The ﬁxed charge
density at the interface, Qf, was determined from the ﬂat-
band voltage, Vfb, measured from the C-V proﬁle, taken at an
applied frequency of 1 MHz, by the relation VFB ¼ uMS  Qf
Cox,
where uMS is the difference in Fermi energy between the
metal contact and semiconductor substrate, and Cox is the ox-
ide capacitance, measured by C-V.15 The interface trap den-
sity, Dit, referring to charge states in the Al2O3 layer that
interact electrically with mobile carriers in the Si substrate,
was determined for ND¼51014cm3 by comparing data
taken at 100Hz and at 1MHz.16 This measurement was not
done for samples with ND¼51013cm3 due to spurious
effects at low frequency, thought to arise from poor contact
to the In-Ga eutectic at low substrate ND. The built-in volt-
age, Vbi, was measured by SPV. The carrier concentration in
the inversion layer, p(IL), was then determined from the
measured Vbi and the offset between EF and the conduction
band edge, EC, in the bulk Si. For the case of ND¼51014,
the built-in voltage was measured by C-V to be 755mV,

tations in determining the photosaturation limit in SPV meas-
urements,17 the value of Vbi derived from SPV, presents a
lower limit, and the value from C-V is considered more accu-
rate. However, as C-V at low frequency was not possible for
the sample with lower doping, Vbi measured by SPV was
used to compare p(IL). Additionally, Vbi at the PEDOT:PSS–
MM–n-Si contact was measured by SPV in two test devices
with no Al2O3, with ND¼51014, and was found to be
50–100mV lower than at the Al2O3–n-type Si interface,
when also measured by SPV.
The ﬁxed charge density, Qf, measured by C-V, reached
3.2(5)  1012 cm2, with the interface trap density, Dit, as
low as 1011 cm2, near the values expected for high quality
Al2O3 passivation layers, reported in the literature.5 The
resulting built-in voltage, Vbi, measured by SPV and, for the
case of ND ¼ 5  1014 cm3, by C-V methods, is shown in
Figure 2 (right axis). The carrier concentration near the sur-
face, derived from Vbi, indicates inversion in all cases stud-
ied, and strong inversion for ND < 5  1016 cm3 (Fig. 2, left
axis). Additionally, low frequency C(V) behavior was seen
as high as 100 kHz, which lends further proof to our claim of
strong inversion.15 Details are presented in supplemental
information.18
Photovoltaic performance results are shown in Figure 3,
where devices of different ND are compared, and the results
are summarized in Table I. For higher doping substrates,
with ND ¼ 5  1015 cm3, the built-in voltage measured by
SPV indicates that the devices are near the strong inversion
limit. These devices show poor performance at 150 lm and
100 lm contact spacing, yielding signiﬁcant photocurrent
only at the narrowest spacing, 50 lm, where the ﬁll factor
remained low. The s-shape near Voc is the characteristic of a
reverse diode, which in this device may lie at the junction
between the stronger inversion layer at the Al2O3-Si inter-
face, and the weaker one induced by the PEDOT:PSS.
Holes traveling from the higher to lower doping when mov-
ing from the strong IL under the Al2O3 to the contact will
experience a transport barrier. When ND is reduced to
5  1014 cm3, where strong inversion is found over the
entire device area, signiﬁcant improvements in all perform-
ance parameters are observed. In this case, devices with
50 lm or 100 lm contact spacing showed equally good per-
formance (Figure 3, red solid line), with average efﬁciency
reaching 7.9(4)% and a maximum of 8.4%. This suggests
that the mobility in this inversion layer, which is expected to
increase with increasing inversion strength due to improved
screening of donor ions, is sufﬁcient to extract carriers
over the larger distances. When ND is further reduced to
5  1013 cm3, an improvement in short circuit current
shows the effect of the strongest inversion layer, and devices
with contact spacing up to 150 lm showed good perform-
ance. However, the reduced ﬁll factor, likely due to the
increased series resistance of the substrate, reduces overall
efﬁciency.
Several types of control devices were made using wafers
with ND ¼ 5  1014 cm3, to assess the relative impact of dif-
ferent factors in device fabrication. Figure 3 (green dashed-
dotted line) shows the performance of a device with the
same structure as the devices described above, without the
passivating molecular monolayer. Instead, the PEDOT:PSS

tact. In this case, a reverse diode was present in all samples
measured. This is consistent with the proposed effect of the
molecular dipole, which should strengthen the inversion
layer at the PEDOT:PSS contact, reducing the potential bar-
rier required for holes to pass to the contact.
Two types of devices without Al2O3 were also studied,
comprising a solar cell based solely on the n-type Si–MM–
PEDOT:PSS (deposited by the LOFO method) junction. In
one case, the restricted 2 min NH4F etch time required for
the Al2O3 devices was used to measure the effect of these
limited etching conditions on device performance. In this
case, only a 5.9(8)% average efﬁciency was found. If, how-
ever, optimal 15 min NH4F etch time is used in preparing
the surface for the MM passivation,10 a device with only
n-type Si–MM–PEDOT:PSS structure reached an average
efﬁciency of 7.4 6 1.0%. The large error bar reﬂects the rela-
tively poor reproducibility found for these devices, compared
to the Al2O3-based devices. Additionally, spin-coating
PEDOT:PSS directly onto Si-H, using similar conditions
to those provided in literature,19 led to an efﬁciency of only
7%. In all of the devices studied, the use of the In-Ga eutec-
tic back contact is likely to impact efﬁciency through
increased series resistance, compared to diffused back
contacts.
External quantum efﬁciency and reﬂectivity were also
compared for a device with Al2O3, and for a PEDOT:PSS
only device, prepared using the optimized sample prepara-
tion conditions, and is presented in supplementary mate-
rial.18 The enhancement in photocurrent for devices with
Al2O3 was found to derive primarily from long wavelength
(above 800 nm) and short wavelength (below 500 nm)
regions, likely resulting from reduced reﬂectivity, and from
improved collection in the bulk due to a wider depletion
width arising from the stronger inversion layer, respectively.
In summary, we demonstrated that the negatively
charged interface of Al2O3 with n-type Si produces large
built-in voltages of up to 755 mV, 50–100 mV higher than
that induced by PEDOT:PSS, leading to strong inversion for
substrate doping concentrations less than 1015 cm3. This
built-in voltage was used as the primary charge separation
potential in a solar cell, using contacts based on the interface
of n-Si, passivated with a dipole-inducing molecular mono-
layer, with PEDOT:PSS as a high work function conductor.
By comparing to devices with Si-H passivated contacts, we
demonstrated the effect of the molecular dipole in enhancing
inversion at the contacting interface. An average device efﬁ-
ciency of 7.9(4)% was reached, exceeding that of PEDOT:
PSS-only devices, consistent with the larger built-in voltage
found. Al2O3-based devices also showed vastly improved
reproducibility over PEDOT:PSS–n-Si solar cells, suggest-
ing that the inversion layer generated by the ﬁxed charges is
more robust to process variation than that induced by the
organic conductor. Comparing optimized to actual MM dep-
osition conditions suggests that improvements in contact
processing can yield further device improvements, and indi-
cations from C-V measurements at low frequency indicate
that an improved back contact may also be helpful.
