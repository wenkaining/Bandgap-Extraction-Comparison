Microsystems become part of everyday life but their application is restricted by lack of strong and fast
motors (actuators) converting energy into motion. For example, widespread internal combustion engines
cannot be scaled down because combustion reactions are quenched in a small space. Here we present an
actuator with the dimensions 100 3 100 3 5 mm3 that is using internal combustion of hydrogen and oxygen
as part of its working cycle. Water electrolysis driven by short voltage pulses creates an extra pressure of 0.5–
4 bar for a time of 100–400 ms in a chamber closed by a flexible membrane. When the pulses are switched off
this pressure is released even faster allowing production of mechanical work in short cycles. We provide
arguments that this unexpectedly fast pressure decrease is due to spontaneous combustion of the gases in the
chamber. This actuator is the first step to truly microscopic combustion engines.
T
he last decennium has witnessed an impressive trend to miniaturize systems of virtually any kind. This trend
has many reasons: small systems are often cheaper to produce, they can have properties large systems have
not, and they may facilitate use of large systems (cars, for example). An important and generic component in
microsystems is the actuator. It plays role of a motor transforming electricity or other kind of energy into
mechanical power. In contrast with large scale systems, where effective engines are available (internal combustion
or electromagnetic motors), microsystems suffer from lack of strong and fast actuators1,2. Small electromagnetic
motors cannot generate forces of useful magnitude but internal combustion engines just do not exist at the
microscale.
The existing microcombusters3 cannot be a part of microsystems since they have only one dimension in the
range of submillimeters. Microengines using gas combustion perform poorly due to increased heat losses via the
volume boundary4,5 when the volume decreases. However, recently we observed that the reaction between H2 and
O2 gases can be ignited spontaneously in stoichiometric nanobubbles smaller than 200 nm overcoming this
restriction in some way6,7. The mechanism is still not clear, but it is expected that both high Laplace pressure and
fast dynamics are important6. It is not obvious that the reaction in nanobubbles and performance of the micro-
scopic actuator are related. Nevertheless, we speculate that the gas combustion in the chamber happens via
combustion in transitional nanobubbles. Nanobubbles already demonstrated counterintuitive properties such
as unexpectedly long life time of the surface nanobubbles (see8 for a review). Mechanism of this stability is still
debated9–12 after more than 10 years of active discussion.
Existing microactuators are using mostly two types of forces1,2,13,14: electrostatic forces (weak) and those
generated by thermal expansion (slow). Small electromagnetic motors cannot generate forces of useful magnitude
but fast and strong piezoelectric elements are not compatible with microtechnology and need a high voltage for
actuation. Some progress was achieved with the use of electroactive polymers15–17 but they are not suitable for
many applications in microsystems. Electrochemical actuation was also discussed in many papers18–24 but it is
notoriously slow. One can produce a large amount of gas in a short time but it is impossible to get rid of this gas
also fast. In this paper we present an actuator that uses alternating polarity (AP) short-time electrolysis6,7 to
produce H2 and O2 gases but termination of the gases happens very fast due to spontaneous combustion.
Results
Fabrication and characterization. The actuators were fabricated on Si wafers covered with a layer of silicon rich
nitride (SiRN) (thickness 530 nm) containing deposited Pt electrodes of different designs. This layer played the
role of the actuator membrane. The membrane was made free by etching the wafer from the back side. The
chamber and filling channels were isotropically etched in borofloat wafers. The glass and Si wafers were anodically

1bonded as shown in Fig. 1. A polysilicon thermal sensor designed for
four-probe measurements was fabricated underneath the electrodes
(see details in Supplementary). The bonded wafers were diced into
separate chips with the size 2 3 1 cm2. The actuator chamber with
the nominal dimensions 100 3 100 3 5 mm3 was filled via the
channel (cross section 10 3 5 mm2) with a solution of Na2SO4 in
deionized water. In most cases the salt concentration was around
1 M. The inlet and outlet openings were sealed with a foil, the chip
was glued to a printed circuit board (PCB) with an opening in the
middle to get access to the membrane from the back side. For one
chip without the covering glass we calibrated the membrane
deflection d in its center versus applied external pressure DP. It
was found that DP 5 Ad 1 Bd3 where A 5 2.03 bar/mm and B 5
0.27 bar/mm3. This relation can be used to estimate the pressure in
the chamber if d is known.
Short square voltage pulses were applied to the electrodes. The
response of the system was observed with a homemade stroboscope25
and with a vibrometer (Polytec MSA-400). In the latter case it was
possible to observe the process from the top (via glass) or from the
bottom focusing the laser beam (l 5 633 nm) with a diameter of
1.5 mm on the membrane. First, we measured the membrane deflec-
tion due to applied voltage pulses from the back side. For this con-
figuration the change of the refractive index of the liquid due to
different reasons (dissolved gas, heating, pressure change) does not
influence the signal of the interferometer. Bubbles with the radius r .
l/2p appearing in the chamber can scatter the light because the
membrane is transparent. To eliminate their effect on the signal we
focused the laser beam on the opaque electrode. With these precau-
tions we can be sure that the measured signal corresponds to the
velocity of the membrane about 10 mm off its center (see
Supplementary Fig. S1).
Electrochemical cell. To achieve a significant actuation stroke in a
short time we have to produce a large amount of gas. For this a large
current through the chamber is needed. An electrochemical cell
supports a large current in the ohmic regime when the current I
and voltage U are related as26 I < (U 2 E0)/R. Here E0 is the water
dissociation potential and R is the resistance of the cell. Both of the
parameters are defined by the cell and it was already noted7 that for
microsystems these parameters are considerably larger than for
macrocells. For example, the I 2 U curve for one of our sample
(see Supplementary Fig. S2) corresponds to E0 5 2.8 V and R 5
3.7 kV. Therefore, to run the actuation fast we need a larger
voltage than usually used for electrolysis. In our experiments we
used AP pulses with the amplitude U 5 5–10 V.
The average current density for our chips is around 200 A cm22. It
results in a very high relative supersaturation S . 1000 nearby the
electrode surface. When S is so large the bubbles nucleate homoge-
neously and exist in the form of nanobubbles during 100 ms or so7.
For single polarity electrolysis the bubbles finally grow to a well
visible microscopic size, but for AP electrolysis only small number
of microbubbles is observed if the switching frequency is larger than
20 kHz (see6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Some additional informa-
tion and estimates are given in Supplementary Information. Let us
note that for macroscopic electrolytic cells observed on a long-time
scale27 the maximal current density is ,1 A cm22 and maximal
supersaturation is ,100.
Membrane deflection. For AP voltage pulses with the amplitude U
5 610 V repeated with the frequency f 5 50 kHz (driving or
switching frequency) during t 5 600 ms the signal and current are
shown in Fig. 2. The signal consists of separate narrow lines of
increasing amplitude correlated with the driving pulses. It is well
visible in Fig. 2d where only five periods for both the signal and
current are shown in the same plot. The signal in Fig. 2a integrated
over time t is the deflection of the membrane d(t). It is shown in
Fig. 2c. The deflection increases with time finally reaching a steady
state while oscillations with the driving frequency f are superimposed
on the smooth curve (see enlarged view in Fig. 2e). In its maximum
the deflection becomes as high as d < 1.4 mm that corresponds to the
pressure increase in the chamber DP < 3.6 bar.

2When the electrochemical process is switched off the pressure
drops very fast (see Fig. 2c). This is our key observation that opens
the way for a closed actuation cycle. A huge amount of gas disappears
in 100 ms or so. The maximal deflection of the membrane corre-
sponds to the apparent volume of gas DV 5 0.7 3 104 mm3 at the
pressure P < 4.6 bar. As the pressure is reduced back to normal this
gas has to fill 60% of the chamber but no gas is visible. The actual
amount of gas is much larger. This is because most of the gas is
densely
packed
in
nanobubbles
(see6,7
and
estimates
in
Supplementary Information). Only small amount of gas can be dis-
solved in the chamber to saturate the liquid. Diffusion out of the
chamber via the filling channels is negligible on this timescale.
Moreover, the gas produced by the single polarity electrolysis, when
hydrogen and oxygen are separated in space (appear near different
electrodes), is well visible and exists on a longer timescale (see
Supplementary Fig. S3). The only reasonable explanation of the
observed fast pressure decrease is consumption of the gases in the
overall reaction of water formation. We cannot separate elementary
steps in this reaction but the process is not catalytic. In 600 ms the
gases diffuse too far away from the electrodes (a few mm) to be
consumed in surface reactions in 100 ms.
Discussion
Our interpretation of the physical events presented in Fig. 2 is the
following. Stoichiometric nanobubbles that are formed nearby the
electrode surface in phase with the electrical pulses6 are responsible
for the sharp peaks in Fig. 2a and 2d. Previously we observed periodic
reduction of gas concentration in the electrolyte above the electro-
des6. Here we can see that in the closed chamber the process is
accompanied also by the periodic variation of the pressure. This is
an independent argument that the combustion reaction happens in
the nanobubbles. The monotonic pressure increase in Fig. 2c is due to
the gas existing as separate hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles and
dissolved molecules. The nanobubbles are formed homogeneously
and very fast because the local supersaturations is high. For each
period more gas is produced than consumed while a steady state is
not reached. In the steady state a part of the produced gas disappears
in correlation with the driving pulses (high frequency oscillation).
The rest of gas gets into the reaction independently on the electrical
pulses (randomly) by formation of stoichiometric nanobubbles in
the solution. This random process is responsible for the fast decrease
of the pressure after the switch off. The details of this interpretation
can change, but the solid fact – the fast pressure decrease – has to be
related to the reaction between H2 and O2.
Thermal effect. The deflection of the membrane demonstrates
dependence on the driving frequency f as shown in Fig. 3a. The
higher the frequency the smaller amount of gas escapes the
reaction resulting in a smaller increase of pressure. For this reason
the heat produced by the combustion reaction must increase with f.
On the contrary, the Joule heating does not depend on f. This is a
clear experimental signature to distinct between the two sources of
heating. To see the thermal effect we observe variations of the
electrolyte conductivity similar to that for any resistive sensor. We
fit each current pulse (half of a period) with the function7 I(t) 5 IF 1
I1 e2kt, where IF is the Faraday current and the second term
(parameters
I1
and
k)
describes
surface
charge-discharge
processes28. Figure 3b shows the Faraday current as a function of
time for different frequencies. The current increase with time
demonstrates the effect of heating. Faster increase for higher
frequencies shows that at least a part of the total heat is produced
by the reaction. Observation of the heating became possible due to
small thermal mass of the membrane.
To estimate an effective temperature in the chamber we measured
(using METTLER TOLEDO SevenMulti) the conductivity of the
bulk solution, s 5 s0(1 1 aDT), as a function of the temperature

3increase DT to find s0 5 15 V21m21 at T 5 20uC and a 5 0.024 K21.
Independently a 5 0.024 6 0.001 K21 was determined from our
samples using external heating. The temperature dependence of
the Faraday current was used to extract information on the effective
temperature (see inset in Fig. 3b). The temperature determined in
this way is closer to the maximal temperature than to the average one
because the most significant contribution to the current comes from
the hottest regions around the electrodes. Our built-in thermal sen-
sors were not fast enough to measure the temperature change on the
time scale 100 ms presumably due to parasitic electrical effects.
Even for very high supersaturation the homogeneous nucleation is
still an activation process. Heating increases the nucleation rate
including the bubbles containing only H2 or O2 gases. Because more
unreacted gas appears in the chamber the pressure has to increase
faster. This effect is responsible for faster than linear increase of d(t)
in Figure 3a. A similar behavior has to be observed when the external
temperature increases. To see this effect one chip was glued to a flat
resistive heater and calibrated with a thermocouple. This configura-
tion was observed from the top. The vibrometer results were equi-
valent to that observed from the bottom except of occasional
scattering on microbubbles appearing more often at low frequencies
or high currents. The results shown in Fig. 4a demonstrate significant
dependence of the deflection on temperature. Scattering on micro-
bubbles is visible as some irregularity for the curve at T 5 30uC.
Actuation frequency. The dynamics of cooling was observed by
applying two series of driving pulses separated by a delay time.
The membrane deflection is shown in Figure 4b. The first series of
pulses 100 ms long heats up the system. The second series is started
when the temperature nearby the electrodes is augmented resulting
in a larger deflection than the first one. When the delay between the
series of pulses increases the effect fades away. The same experiment
demonstrates how fast the membrane can be actuated using series of
pulses separated in time (see also Supplementary Fig. S4). From our
data it follows that cyclic operation with an actuation frequency of F
5 5 kHz is feasible and at this frequency the actuator is able to deliver
the overpressure on the level of 1 bar. Small increase in the external
temperature can increase both the actuation frequency and the
developed force. The maximal stoke can be reached for the
minimal driving frequency around f 5 20 kHz, however, for small
f degradation of electrodes is observed6 and the optimal driving
frequency is a matter of durability and material choice. Of course,
the actuation with the driving frequency F 5 f , 100 kHz is also
possible but with a smaller amplitude (pressure).
In conclusion, the results reported in this paper not only dem-
onstrate a fast and strong actuator that can be applied in microflui-
dics, micro/nano positioning, or in compact sound/ultrasound
emitters. More importantly, they demonstrate feasibility of combus-
tion reactions in microscopic volumes. This is a fundamental state-
ment that opens up new possibilities to power micro and mini
systems.
