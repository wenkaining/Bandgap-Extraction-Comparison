Thermoelectric devices can directly convert waste heat into electricity, which makes them an important
clean energy technology. The underlying materials performance can be evaluated by the dimensionless
ﬁgure of merit ZT. Metal halides are attractive candidates due to their chemical ﬂexibility and ease of
processing; however, the maximum ZT realized (ZT = 0.15) falls far below the level needed for com-
mercialization (ZT > 1). Using a ﬁrst-principles procedure, we assess the thermoelectric potential of
copper halide CsCu2I3, which features one-dimensional Cu-I connectivity. The n-type crystal is predicted
to exhibit a maximum ZT of 2.2 at 600 K along the b axis. The strong phonon anharmonicity of this
system is shown by locally stable noncentrosymmetric Amm2 structures that are averaged to form the
observed centrosymmetric Cmcm space group. Our work provides insights into the structure-property
relations in metal halide thermoelectrics and suggests a path forward to engineer higher-performance
heat-to-electricity conversion.

I. INTRODUCTION
Thermoelectric materials—which enable the direct con-
version of waste heat to electricity—have received great
attention as one of the most promising renewable energy
technologies [1]. The performance of thermoelectric mate-
rials is evaluated by the dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, ZT:
ZT =
S2σT
κelec + κlatt
.
(1)
Here S is the Seebeck coeﬃcient, σ is the electrical
conductivity, T is the temperature, κelec is the electronic
thermal conductivity, and κlatt is the lattice thermal conduc-
tivity [the power factor (PF) is deﬁned as S2σ]. Because
of the recent progress in calculation methods for electron
(hole) and phonon transport in solid crystals, computa-
tional studies have sought to discover novel compounds
that possess a high ZT [2–5]. Although the trade-oﬀeﬀect

between the parameters that control ZT makes the opti-
mization challenging, search for an intrinsically low κlatt
material is still crucial to maximize performance [6]. In
other words, high thermoelectric performance requires the
phonons to be disrupted like in a glass but the electrons
to have a high mobility like in crystalline semiconductors
(i.e., phonon-glass electron crystal) [7].
A. Metal halide thermoelectrics
Metal halides have been studied for their uses in vari-
ous applications, including solar cells [8,9], light-emitting
diodes [10,11], and memristors [12,13]. These materials
are also known to have an intrinsically “ultralow” κlatt
(< 1 W/m K) [14–16], and several reports have started
to suggest their potential for thermoelectric applications
(Table I).
However, the highest maximum ZT of 0.15 achieved
for halide perovskite CsSnI3 [18] is far from competing
with top thermoelectric materials such as SnSe whose
maximum ZT is > 2.6 [29]. In addition, studies were
mainly conducted on conventional halide perovskites,
while emerging low-dimensional metal halides have yet
to be explored. Recently, we reported a high thermoelec-
tric potential in metal halide Cs3Cu2I5 for the ﬁrst time
where asymmetric heat and charge transport in the material
enables a high maximum ZT of 2.6 at 600 K [28].

In this article, we present CsCu2I3 as a candidate for
thermoelectric applications on the basis of ﬁrst-principles
predictions. CsCu2I3 is one of the copper-based low-
dimensional halide compounds where one-dimensional
(1D) [Cu2I3]−anionic chains are separated by Cs+ cations.
By performing lattice dynamics simulations, we found that
heat transport in the material is highly anisotropic where
κlatt in the a-b plane (perpendicular to the chains) is about
2 times lower than that along the c axis (chain direc-
tion). We also conﬁrmed that the experimentally reported
Cmcm structure of the material is not dynamically stable
but an average of Amm2 structures during our phonon anal-
ysis. Interestingly, electron transport in the material shows
an opposite anisotropy compared to the phonon transport;
electron mobility in the a-b plane is 1.5 times higher than
that along the c axis. Because of this unique anisotropy
of heat and electron transport in a single material, we
predict that CsCu2I3 in the Amm2 structure reaches a ZT
of 2.2 at 600 K along the b axis, having potential as a
next-generation thermoelectric material.
II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. First-principles thermoelectrics workﬂow
The workﬂow to predict ZT from ﬁrst principles is
shown in Fig. 1. In principle, this only requires prior
knowledge of a crystal structure and all other properties
can be directly calculated in turn. As the ﬁrst step, the crys-
tal structure of a compound of interest should be optimized
to a local minimum in the potential energy surface. If
the compound shows imaginary phonon modes, additional
crystal structure optimization and/or anharmonic correc-
tions should be applied to obtain a dynamically stable
structure, so that reliable thermal properties can be calcu-
lated [30]. With the dynamically stable crystal structure,
bulk properties can be assessed. Results from steps 2–4
are given as inputs for calculating carrier lifetimes and
transport properties—S, σ, and κelec (step 5), while lat-
tice thermal conductivity κlatt is obtained from anharmonic
phonon calculations (steps 6 and 7). Finally, thermoelec-
tric properties such as ZT and thermodynamic eﬃciency
(η) are predicted by combining the outputs from steps 5
and 7. Computational details are provided in Sec. IV.
B. Structural analysis
CsCu2I3 has been reported in a Cmcm space group
[31,32], where 1D [Cu2I3]−anionic chains are separated
by Cs+ cations, as shown in Fig. 2. When the experi-
mentally known structure was adopted and optimized, we
found that imaginary phonon modes are persistent across
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone [see Fig. 3(a)], which conﬁrms
dynamic structural instability of the Cmcm structure. (This
will be further discussed in Sec. II C.) To obtain a dynam-
ically stable crystal structure, we deformed the Cmcm
structure along the eigenvector of its imaginary  phonon
mode, which results in a structural transition to a new
lower-symmetry Amm2 phase. The structural transition
from Cmcm to Amm2 occurs with atomic positions shifted
along the directions indicated by the arrows in Figs. 2(a)

and 2(c). Cs and I atoms move within the b axis and a-
b plane, respectively, while Cu atoms move along the c
axis. The Cu—I—Cu bond angle for Cmcm is alternately
71.54◦and 71.16 ◦, while polyhedra distortion in Amm2
results in bond angles of 61.39◦and 81.42◦, as shown in
Figs. 2(e) and 2(f). In Cmcm, the Cu—I bond lengths in the
[CuI4]3−tetrahedron are of a similar value (2.62 and 2.61
Å, two each), as opposed to the bonds in Amm2 all hav-
ing a diﬀerent value (2.66, 2.65, 2.58, and 2.61 Å). Thus,
while the crystal system is maintained as orthorhombic, the
crystal symmetry is lowered from centrosymmetric Cmcm
to noncentrosymmetric Amm2. Comparison of the calcu-
lated lattice parameters of Cmcm and Amm2, as well as the
experimental values from X-ray diﬀraction measurements
are provided in Table II. The structural transition results
in a0 decreasing by 0.30%, while b0 increases by 0.84%,
with both changes due to the movements of Cs and I
atoms. In contrast, c0 is equivalent in both structures, as the
shift in Cu atoms evens out macroscopically. Amm2 has an
expanded volume of 0.70% compared to Cmcm. The elas-
tic and dielectric tensors calculated from Cmcm and Amm2
phases are provided in the Supplemental Material [34].

the Materials Project [35] repository, as well as computa-
tional [36] and experimental [33] reports, indicate CsCu2I3
as a Cmcm structure, dynamic structural instability of
Cmcm is evident by the numerous imaginary modes shown
in Fig. 3(a). The eigenvector components for the imagi-
nary mode at the  point of Cmcm are shown by arrows
in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c). Using ModeMap [37], the corre-
sponding energy as a function of the distortion amplitude
along the eigenvectors illustrated in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c) is
shown in Fig. 4. A characteristic double-well potential-
energy curve is shown. The saddle point corresponds to
the Cmcm structure, while the two wells indicate the lower
symmetry Amm2 structure as a local minimum. Thus, the
energy-lowering distortion causes a structural transition
to a ground-state polymorph, Amm2, with an energy 2.84
meV/atom lower than Cmcm. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the
absence of imaginary phonon modes indicates the dynamic
stability of Amm2. However, as the depth of the potential
energy well is relatively shallow, the well would be eas-
ily ﬁlled at room temperature (kBT ∼25.7 meV), and at
this state a mixture of Amm2 and Cmcm structures would
exist. Hence, we propose that the previously reported cen-
trosymmetric Cmcm structure is a macroscopic average
over locally noncentrosymmetric Amm2 structures. This
phenomenon is similar to the case of SnSe, where the
superposition of the locally ordered structure (Pnma) leads
to the average structure (Cmcm) [38]. The simulated XRD
patterns of the Cmcm and Amm2 structures are displayed
in Fig. S1 within the Supplemental Material [34]. As
anticipated, additional peaks corresponding to the Amm2
structure are observed. However, the intensity ratio of
these peaks to the main ones is signiﬁcantly low. This
makes it diﬃcult to distinguish them, particularly given
the typical signal-to-noise ratio associated with standard
XRD techniques. In addition, in the Amm2 structure, a
lack of inversion symmetry causes a spontaneous electric
polarization. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c), polarization
mainly occurs within the a-b plane by the shift of Cs and
I atoms, while minute polarization along the c axis corre-
sponds to the movement of Cu atoms. The corresponding
piezoelectric tensor of the Amm2 structure is provided in
Table S1 within the Supplemental Material [34].
D. Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity
Figure 5 shows the κlatt of Amm2 CsCu2I3, as a function
of temperature along diﬀerent crystallographic directions.
Because CsCu2I3 is experimentally reported to have a
melting point at about 644 K [33,39], the temperature
range for calculating κlatt as well as transport and ther-
moelectric properties discussed later is set up to 600 K.
Amm2 shows an unexpectedly low κlatt (i.e., ultralow κlatt)
of a value under 0.1 W/m K for all directions even at 300
K; 0.05, 0.03, and 0.08 W/m K for the a, b, and c axes,
respectively. The isotropically averaged κlatt (κavg) at 300
K is 0.05 W/m K, which is lower than one of the top ther-
moelectric materials, SnSe (0.2 W/m K at 300 K [40]).
The value is slightly higher compared to Cs3Cu2I5 (κavg =

0.02 W/m K at room temperature [28]), which was calcu-
lated at a similar level of theory. At 600 K, the κlatt values
are 0.02 W/m K along the a and b axes, and 0.04 W/m K
along the c axis (κavg being 0.03 W/m K). The anisotropy
of CsCu2I3, having a higher κlatt along the c axis, can be
ascribed to a weaker chemical bonding towards the c axis
of the unit cell [41]. It is worth noting that the c axis is
parallel to the [Cu2I3]−chains.
Acoustic phonon modes and low-frequency optic modes
act as the primary heat carriers in crystals, mainly con-
tributing to κlatt. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the low-lying optic
modes of Amm2 are relatively ﬂat, which leads to low
group velocities (vλ), one of the reasons for its ultralow
κlatt. In addition, the high density of the low-lying optic
modes produces a large number of scattering channels at
this frequency range, causing short phonon lifetimes (τλ).

(κavg) along the three (a, b, and c) axes.
Figure S2 within the Supplemental Material [34] shows
avoided crossings of the acoustic and low-frequency optic
modes along the –Y direction. Avoided crossing is a
characteristic feature shown when a “rattler” is present in
the material [42]. PDOS shown in Fig. 3(b) indicates that
lower-frequency phonon modes mostly comprise motions
of Cs atoms. Thus, we can infer that Cs atoms behave
as the rattler, rattling within the space between [Cu2I3]−
chains. Figure S3 within the Supplemental Material [34]
shows the Cs—I bonds (total ten), and the broad range
of bond lengths from 3.81 to 4.21 Å contributes to the
anharmonicity of CsCu2I3. This is similar to the origin
of anharmonicity of SnSe [43]. We note that ﬂuctua-
tions between Cmcm and Amm2 could also contribute to
the scattering of the heat transport, but such higher-order
anharmonicity is not considered here.

To further understand the origins of the ultralow κlatt of
CsCu2I3, we analyzed the modal contributions to the net
transport (Fig. 6). The net transport κlatt is a sum of the
individual phonon modes (λ):

Here N is the number of unit cells in the crystal (equivalent
to the number of wave vectors included in the Brillouin
zone summation), V0 is the volume of the crystallographic
unit cell, and Cλ is the modal heat capacity. The frequency
spectra of vλ, τλ, and the phonon mean free path (	λ =
vλ × τλ) at 300 K are shown in Figs. 6(a)–6(c), respec-
tively [44]. In the entire frequency range, the majority of vλ
falls within the range 1–103 m/s, and the fastest modes are
seen in the 0–0.2-THz frequency range. The fastest modes
correspond to the acoustic phonon bands that are relatively
dispersive compared to the optic modes. The overall spec-
tra are comparable to (CH3NH3)PbI3 (MAPbI3) [45], a 3D
perovskite reported to have an ultralow κlatt of 0.05 W/m K
at 300 K, while the fastest modes have a lower vλ in
CsCu2I3. In addition, a number of modes have a very low
vλ, from 10−12 to 10−10 m/s, unseen in the vλ spectra of
MAPbI3 [45] and Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. These modes correspond
to the low-lying optic modes in the 0.2–2.4-THz frequency
range that are relatively ﬂat. The low vλ is attributed to the
heavy elements that constitute CsCu2I3.
Lifetimes τλ mostly fall within the range 10−1–101 ps,
while a number of phonon modes within the 0–0.2-THz
frequency range (acoustic phonon modes) have a τλ longer
than 10 ps. The overall spectra is similar to MAPbI3 [45]
and Cs3Cu2I5 [28], while the longest τλ of CsCu2I3 are
longer compared to Cs3Cu2I5 (longest being 11 ps). The
combination of a low vλ and τλ leads to the majority of
the modes having 	λ shorter than 100 nm, which is why
CsCu2I3 shows an ultralow κlatt. The low-frequency modes
(acoustic and low-lying optic modes) have a relatively
faster vλ and longer τλ, resulting in a longer 	λ compared
to the high-frequency modes. This matches with the fact
that acoustic and low-lying optic modes are the primary
heat carriers.
E. Electronic structure and transport properties
The electronic band structures of Cmcm and Amm2 are
illustrated in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), respectively. Both Cmcm
and Amm2 phases have a direct band gap (Eg) at the 
point, with Eg values of 3.23 and 3.08 eV, respectively.
The calculated Eg is similar to the experimental value esti-
mated from the optical absorption spectrum, 3.49 eV [39].
As shown in Fig. S4 within the Supplemental Material
[34], upper valence bands are dominated by Cu 3d and I
5p orbitals, while lower conduction bands arise from the
FIG. 8.

tion of temperature along diﬀerent crystallographic axes. “Avg.”

hybridization of Cu 4s and I 5p orbitals. For the conduc-
tion band minimum, I 5s contributes more compared to I
5p. Calculation of the orbitals that comprise band edges are
in good agreement with previous reports [33,39]. The con-
tribution of Cs orbitals on those band edges is negligible,
which is the well-known feature of low-dimensional metal
halides [46,47]. The corresponding orbitals are also equiv-
alent to the electronic band structure of Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. The
upper valence band is relatively ﬂat, having a hole eﬀec-
tive mass of 0.83 me at the valence band maximum, while
the lower conduction band is relatively dispersive with an
electron eﬀective mass of 0.31 me at the conduction band
minimum. The conduction band has multiple valleys (
point, Z point, and along the S-R and Y-T directions), and
the energy diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and second conduc-
tion band edges is 0.57 eV for Amm2. The dispersive nature
and multiple valleys lead to a high σ and S, respectively,
suggesting the possibility of CsCu2I3 as a promising n-type
thermoelectric material.
Figure 8 shows the calculated electron mobility μ of
Amm2 as a function of temperature along diﬀerent crystal-
lographic directions at the optimal electron concentration
ne (6 × 1018 cm−3) at which thermoelectric properties are
maximized [ne will be further discussed in Fig. 10(a)
below]. Similar to κlatt, μ is anisotropic, with μ being
lower along the c axis. The isotropically averaged μ is
21.4 cm2/V s at 300 K, which is slightly higher than the
μ of Cs3Cu2I5 [28] (18.2 cm2/V s at room temperature).
Figure S5 within the Supplemental Material [34] shows μ
of Cmcm and Amm2 by the individual scattering mech-
anisms. Acoustic deformation potential (ADP), ionized
impurity (IMP), and polar optical phonon (POP) scatter-
ing mechanisms were considered for both structures, and
for Amm2 (noncentrosymmetric), the piezoelectric (PIE)
scattering mechanism was considered as well. Here μ is
limited by POP scattering for both structures, followed by
IMP and ADP scattering. POP scattering is dominant in
many of the top thermoelectric materials including SnSe

[48] and Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. In Amm2, PIE scattering has the
smallest contribution to the total μ, as its polarization is
minute.
The electronic transport properties—σ, S, PF, and
κelec—of Amm2 as a function of temperature and ne are
shown in Fig. S6 within the Supplemental Material [34].
Here σ and κelec are proportional to ne, but have an inverse
relationship with temperature. On the other hand, |S| is
disproportionate with ne, and increases with temperature.
Figure 9 shows σ, S, PF, and κelec as a function of tem-
perature along diﬀerent crystallographic directions (ne =
6 × 1018 cm−3); σ, κelec, and PF are higher along the a and
b axes, which reﬂects the anisotropy of μ; |S| is almost
equivalent along all axes. Along the b axis, PF goes up to
109.66 µW/m K2 at 470 K.
F. Thermoelectric properties
By combining the phonon and electron transport prop-
erties using Eq. (1), ZT for CsCu2I3 as a function of
temperature along diﬀerent crystallographic axes is pre-
dicted [Fig. 9(e)]. Because of the anisotropy of σ, κlatt,
and κelec, ZT is also anisotropic, showing a lower value
along the c axis. At 600 K, it reaches a value of 2.2
along the b axis, while the a and c axes have a ZT of 1.7
and 0.8, respectively. Notably, a high ZT is obtained at a
lower temperature compared to the state-of-the-art ther-
moelectric material, n-type SnSe, which has a ZT of 2.0
above 700 K [49]. The origin of a high ZT is a combi-
nation of ultralow κlatt and high PF. Figure 10(a) shows
the isotropically averaged ZT of CsCu2I3 as a function of
temperature and ne. The ﬁgure of merit ZT is maximized
at ne = 6 × 1018 cm−3, and the maximum ZT achievable
at this condition is 1.5 at 600 K. As mentioned above,
the highest ZT from a conventional halide perovskite was
only 0.15, so this work may derive more attention towards
CsCu2I3 and other low-dimensional metal halides.

Using these equations, we plotted η as a function of TH,
while TC is ﬁxed to 200 K [Fig. 10(b)]. A maximum η of
13.1% is achieved when the temperature diﬀerence is 400
K (TH = 400 K), and ZT is 0.8.
The main concern when fabricating CsCu2I3 for ther-
moelectric applications would be whether the optimal ne
could be achieved by doping. Currently, doping of low-
dimensional metal halides is underexplored, but below
we address some of the doping strategies that can be
implemented. Similar to the doping approaches of 3D per-
ovskites, doping in low-dimensional metal halides could
be achieved by either (1) adding dopant sources to the
precursor solution, (2) postsynthesis solution doping or
(3) postsynthesis vapor doping [50]. The speciﬁc methods
could be adding atomic dopants, and molecular dopants

by surface doping. The Cu atoms of CsCu2I3 mainly con-
tribute to the edge of the band structure [50] (cf. Fig. S4
within the Supplemental Material [34]). Thus, substituting
Cu+ with +2 charged ions is more likely to produce the
necessary states to tune ne, compared to the doping of Cs
and I.
Another crucial factor when making a thermoelectric
module out of a material is the stability of its bulk form.
Several experimental studies have synthesized single crys-
tal CsCu2I3 and veriﬁed its air stability, the longest being
up to 45 d while maintaining high phase purity and crys-
talline quality [47,51,52]. Excellent thermal stability up to
614 K without phase change is also veriﬁed via diﬀeren-
tial scanning calorimetry [33]. Therefore, combined with
encapsulation technologies to enhance oxygen and mois-
ture resistance, it is expected that stable thermoelectric
generators are feasible.
The ﬁgure of merit ZT of CsCu2I3 is relatively low com-
pared to Cs3Cu2I5. However, it is reported that CsCu2I3
is more stable than Cs3Cu2I5 when dopants are added,
and the unstable Cs3Cu2I5 decompose and form CsCu2I3
[53]. Thus, although a higher optimal ne is required for
CsCu2I3 (6 × 1018 cm−3, compared to 4 × 1018 cm−3
for Cs3Cu2I5), it may be achieved more easily. In addi-
tion, whether this high thermoelectric performance is
shown only for CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5, or from low-
dimensional metal halides in general, requires further
investigation. Through our initial calculations, copper-
based metal halides K2CuX3 and CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br)
are also expected to have a high potential as an n-type ther-
moelectric material. Changing the alkali metals or halo-
gens to those in the same group of the periodic table is also
worth a try. Thus, investigating Cs3Cu2X5 and Rb2CuX3
(X = Cl, Br) as well as RbCu2Y3 (Y = Br, I) could be
possible.
III. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we reported a new direction for metal
halide thermoelectrics with a predictive study on the struc-
ture, properties, and performance of CsCu2I3.
The dynamic structural instability of the previously
known Cmcm structure of CsCu2I3 was investigated. We
reported a new, ground-state Amm2 structure of CsCu2I3
and compared its basic bulk properties with Cmcm. The
ultralow κlatt of Amm2 and its origins were studied in
detail. Additionally, the electronic transport properties as
well as ZT were ﬁrst reported in this work. We predict that
CsCu2I3 is a new promising n-type thermoelectric mate-
rial, and require further investigations in low-dimensional
metal halides.
The centrosymmetric Cmcm structure is a macroscopic
average over locally noncentrosymmetric Amm2 struc-
tures. The octahedra distortion leads to an energy-lowering
structural transition from Cmcm to Amm2, the energy being
2.84 meV/atom lower. The lack of inversion symmetry in
Amm2 results in a spontaneous lattice polarization mainly
within the a-b plane.
Amm2 shows an ultralow κlatt with κavg at 300 K of
0.05 W/m K, with the values being higher along the c axis
(i.e., anisotropic). The low vλ is due to the low-frequency
optic modes being relatively ﬂat. Avoided crossings of
the acoustic and low-lying optic modes are shown from
the dispersion, which is the cause of short τλ. Cs atoms
between the [Cu2I3]−chains behave as rattlers, and the
inequivalent Cs—I bond lengths give rise to a strong
anharmonicity. The structural transition between Cmcm
and Amm2 could also contribute to the phonon scattering.
The conduction band of CsCu2I3 is relatively disper-
sive and has multiple valleys, which is the reason for its
high σ and S, respectively, characteristics of a novel n-type
thermoelectric material. POP is the dominant scattering
mechanism for both Cmcm and Amm2, and PIE scattering
is also considered in Amm2 because of its lack of inversion
symmetry. Similar to κlatt, the electronic properties are also
anisotropic (superior along the a and b axes).
The predicted ZT of CsCu2I3 reaches 2.2 at 600 K along
the b axis (ne = 6 × 1018 cm−3), comparable to the ZT
of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. The origin of
high ZT is a combination of ultralow κlatt and high PF. A
thermodynamic eﬃciency η of 13.1% is achievable when
CsCu2I3 is used in a thermoelectric generator (TH = 600
K, TC = 200 K).
IV. METHODS
A. Density functional theory calculations
Calculations of the total energy, electronic band struc-
ture, and inputs for the AMSET package such as the dielec-
tric, elastic, and piezoelectric constants were performed
using density functional theory (DFT) within periodic
boundary conditions through the Vienna ab initio simu-
lation package (VASP) [54,55]. The projector-augmented-
wave (PAW) [56,57] method was employed to explic-
itly treat the valence states of Cs, Cu, and I atoms as
9 (5s25p66s1), 17 (2p63d104s1), and 7 (5s25p5) electrons,
respectively.
For structure optimization, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
exchange-correlation functional revised for solids (PBEsol)
[58] was used with a 6 × 6 × 8 -centered k mesh, a plane-
wave kinetic energy cutoﬀof 700 eV, and the convergence
criteria set to 10−8 eV and 10−4 eV/Å for the total energy
and atomic forces, respectively. The elastic and dielectric
constant was calculated using the ﬁnite-displacement (FD)
method and density functional perturbation theory, respec-
tively. The bulk modulus was calculated using the Phonopy
[59] code by ﬁtting the energy volume to the third-order
Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [60].
Calculations of the electronic band structure and elec-
tron transport were done using the hybrid DFT functional
043004-9PARK, JUNG, and WALSH
PRX ENERGY 2, 043004 (2023)
of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06) [61]. Com-
pared to the structure optimization, a denser k mesh of
12 × 12 × 16 was used, while the kinetic energy cutoﬀwas
lowered to 400 eV. The hole and electron eﬀective mass,
m∗, was calculated using the sumo [62] code, which uses
parabolic ﬁtting by the equation
1
m∗= ∂2E(k)
∂k2
1
ℏ2 ,
(5)
where E(k) is the band energy as a function of the electron
wave vector k, and ℏis the reduced Plank constant. The
electronic band structure calculated above was used as the
input.
B. Structure distortion
Harmonic-level phonon calculations were performed
using the Phonopy [59] code with VASP as the force calcu-
lator. The second-order interatomic force constants (IFCs)
were computed using the supercell FD approach with a
3 × 3 × 3 k mesh of step size 0.01 Å. A total of 11 dis-
placements for Cmcm and 22 displacements for Amm2
were calculated. A 2 × 2 × 3 supercell of the 12-atom unit
cell (144 atoms) was employed for both structures. The
ModeMap [37] code was used to compute the displace-
ment of the atoms, uj ,l (j th atom in the lth unit cell), along
an imaginary-mode eigenvector, Wλ,j (λ is the phonon
mode), at the  point:
uj ,l =
1
√namj
ℜ
 
λ
QλWλ,j e−iqrj ,l

.
(6)
Here mj is the atomic mass, na is the number of atoms
in the supercell used to model the displacement, Qλ is the
distortion amplitude, q is the phonon wave vector, and rj ,l
is the atomic position. Postprocessing was also performed
using the code to map the energy, U(Q), as a function
of Qλ along the given Wλ,j (cf. Fig. 4). The ground-state
structure, Amm2, was then obtained using the structure at
the energy minimum.
C. Phonon and electron transport
The κlatt calculations were carried out using the
Phono3py
[63]
code,
solving
the
linearized
Boltz-
mann transport equation (BTE) using the single-mode
relaxation-time approximation (RTA) [Eq. (2)]. The third-
order IFCs were calculated with an FD step size of 0.03 Å,
and a total of 5568 displacements were considered in a 48-
atom unit cell. A q mesh of 12 × 12 × 16 was employed to
compute the lattice thermal conductivity. Graphical anal-
ysis of the modal properties were performed using the
Phonopy-power-tool [44] code. Convergence tests for the
lattice thermal conductivity over a q mesh, and distribu-
tion of force norms for the force sets can be found in Fig.
S7 within the Supplemental Material [34].
Unlike the BoltzTraP [64] code, the AMSET [65] pack-
age uses DFT band structures to solve the BTE without
the constant RTA. Comparison between computational
and experimental values can be found from several stud-
ies, which validate the accuracy of the AMSET package
[65,66]. Combined with κlatt, which was calculated at a
similar level of theory to our work, the predicted ZT
values agree well with experimental measurements [66].
The characteristic scattering rate, τe, is calculated using
Matthiessen’s rule:

The mode-dependent scattering rates, from state |nk⟩to

ℏ|gnm(k, q)|2δ(εnk −εmk+q)

with ε the electron energy, δ the Dirac delta function,
and g the coupling matrix element. The electron trans-

As mentioned above, the required material parameters
such as the dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric constants,
phonon frequencies, and deformation potential were deter-
mined by DFT calculations (Table S1 within the Supple-
mental Material [34]). As the valence bands are relatively
ﬂat, calculations were only conducted under n-type doping
conditions, in the doping range from 1016 to 1021, and the
temperature range from 200 to 600 K. The interpolation
factor was set to 10 for all AMSET calculations. Conver-
gence tests for the electron transport calculations over a k
mesh and the interpolation factor can be found in Fig. S6
within the Supplemental Material [34].
Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) was not included in calcu-
lating the electron transport properties since we conﬁrmed
043004-10METAL HALIDE THERMOELECTRICS. . .
PRX ENERGY 2, 043004 (2023)
that the eﬀect of SOC on the electronic band structure is
small in this Cu-based compound—unlike Sn- or Pb-based
metal halides [67,68], even for the noncentrosymmetric
Amm2 phase. Figure S8 within the Supplemental Mate-
rial [34] shows changes in the band structure of Cmcm and
Amm2 CsCu2I3 with and without SOC.
An online repository containing the optimized crystal
structures, force constant sets, and raw AMSET input-
output ﬁles is available from Zenodo [69].
