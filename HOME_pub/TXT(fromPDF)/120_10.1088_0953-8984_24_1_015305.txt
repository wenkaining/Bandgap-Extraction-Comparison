Abstract
A novel type of one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystal formed by an array of periodically
located stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background
dielectric medium is proposed. The wave equation for the electromagnetic wave propagating
in such a structure is solved in the framework of the Kronig–Penney model. The frequency
band structure of the 1D graphene-based photonic crystal is obtained analytically as a function
of the ﬁlling factor and the thickness of the dielectric between the graphene stripes. The
photonic frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized by a defect of the
photonic crystal formed by an extra dielectric placed in the position of one stack of alternating
graphene and dielectric stripes is obtained.

1. Introduction
Photonic crystals are formed by structures with the dielectric
constant periodically varying in space [1]. Electromagnetic
waves in photonic crystals have a band spectrum and a
coordinate dependence caused by this periodicity of the
dielectric constant. Interestingly enough, the solution of
Maxwell’s equations with a periodic dielectric constant,
resulting in photonic bandgap structures, is similar to the
solution to Schr¨odinger’s equation for a periodic potential,
resulting in the electron energy bandgap structures in
solids. Electromagnetic waves penetrate the photonic crystal
similarly to the Bloch waves of electrons in a regular
crystal. The width of the photonic bandgap depends on
the geometrical parameters of the photonic crystal and
the contrast of the dielectric constants of the constituent
elements [2, 3]. Different materials have been used for
the corresponding constituent elements including dielectrics,
semiconductors and metals [2, 3, 6–9]. Photonic crystals
with superconducting elements have been studied in [10–16].
One-dimensional photonic crystals formed by semiconductors
were analyzed in [17]. It is well known that the properties
of photonic crystals provide an opportunity to manipulate
the emission, propagation and distribution of light [4, 5]
and photonic crystals can be used as frequency ﬁlters. The
properties of photonic crystals were reviewed in [18].
Photonic crystals are different from regular solid crystals
in the following way. While the Schr¨odinger’s equation
describes regular solid crystals via the scalar wavefunction,
Maxwell’s equations for photonic bandgap crystals describe
the electric or magnetic ﬁeld, which is a vector corresponding
to the transverse electromagnetic waves.

a

honeycomb lattice of the carbon atoms that form the
basic planar structure in graphite [19, 20]. Due to the
unusual properties of the band structure, the electronic
properties of graphene have become the object of many
recent experimental and theoretical studies [19–25]. Graphene
is a gapless semiconductor with massless electrons and
holes which have been described as Dirac fermions [26].
The unique electronic properties of graphene in a magnetic
ﬁeld have been studied recently [27–30]. The space–time
dispersion of graphene conductivity was analyzed in [31].
A graphene-based two-dimensional photonic crystal was
proposed in
[32], where its frequency band structure was
studied. Different types of 2D photonic crystals were reviewed
in [33].

In this paper, we consider a one-dimensional photonic
crystal formed by an array of periodically located parallel
stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded
into a background dielectric medium. The graphene stripes are
placed one under the other with the dielectric stripes placed
between them. We calculate the frequency band structure
of such a photonic crystal. The photonic band structure can
usually be obtained using numerical calculations. In this
paper we obtain the analytical solution for the wave equation
with the periodical dielectric function. We also calculate
the frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave
localized due to a defect in the array of stacks of graphene
stripes separated by dielectric stripes.
The paper is organized in the following way. In
section 2 we obtain the photonic band structure of the
1D graphene-based photonic crystal. In section 3 we ﬁnd
the frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave
localized by a defect of a 1D graphene-based photonic crystal.
Finally, a discussion of the results and conclusions follow in
section 4.
2. The wave equation for 1D photonic crystal with
graphene stripes
We consider polarized electromagnetic waves with the electric
ﬁeld E perpendicular to the plane of the graphene stripes. The
wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in a dielectric medium has
the form [34]
1E(r, t) −ε(r, t)
c2
∂2E(r, t)
∂t2
= 0,
(1)
where ε(r, t) is the dielectric constant of the medium and
c is the speed of light in vacuum. Looking for solutions
with harmonic time variation of the electric ﬁeld, i.e.,
E(r, t) = E(r)eiωt, and considering the propagation of a wave
in the x-direction along the plane of the graphene stripes
and perpendicular to the graphene–dielectric boundaries one
obtains from equation (1)
∂2Ez(x)
∂x2
+ ω2ε(x, ω)

Ez(x) = 0.

The dielectric constant of the 1D periodic structure is
given by
ε(x, ω) =

where ε0 is the dielectric constant of the dielectric, ε1(ω) is
the dielectric function of the graphene multilayers separated
by the dielectric barriers, a is the period of the 1D array
of graphene stripes, b is the width of the graphene stripes,
and n is an integer. The 1D photonic crystal with graphene
stripes separated by dielectric layers of thickness d is shown
in ﬁgure 1. By introducing the ﬁlling factor f the relation
between a and b can be written as b = af.

Here e is the charge of an electron, τ −1 is the electron
collision rate, η is the Heaviside step function, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, and µ is the chemical potential
determined by the electron concentration, which is controlled
by the doping. The chemical potential can be calculated as
µ = (πn0)1/2 ¯hvF, where the electron concentration is given
by n0 = (µ/(¯hvF))2 /π and vF = 108 cm s−1 is the Fermi
velocity of electrons in graphene [36].
We solve the wave equation (2) to ﬁnd the eigenfrequen-
cies corresponding to the electromagnetic wave penetrating in
the photonic crystal shown in ﬁgure 1. This wave equation
is mathematically similar to the Schr¨odinger equation for an
electron moving in a one-dimensional rectangular periodic
potential barrier described by the Kronig–Penney model. The
eigenenergies of the Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to
the Kronig–Penney model presented in equations (A.1) are
given by [37]

The eigenfrequencies of the 1D photonic crystal as
functions of the wavevector k can be obtained by substituting
the dielectric constant of the multilayer graphene given by
equation (3) into (7). The solutions of equation (7) for ω
as functions of k provide the frequency band structure for
the 1D photonic crystal formed by the periodically located
parallel stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes
embedded into a background dielectric medium and allow one
to determine the photonic bandgap . Equation (7) shows that
the photonic bandgap depends on the ﬁlling factor f and the
period of the 1D array of graphene stripes a, as well as on the
thickness d of the dielectric stripes that separate the graphene
stripes. Let us mention that the dependence of the photonic
bandgap on the thickness d of the dielectric layer, which
separates the graphene stripes, is presented in (7), since the
dielectric function ε1(ω) (3) of a graphene multilayer system
separated by dielectric layers depends on d.
3. Localization of the electromagnetic wave on the
defect
Let us consider a defect in the array of stacks of alternating
graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background
dielectric medium. This defect is formed by one empty
space or ‘1D vacancy’ due to the absence of a stack of
alternating graphene and dielectric stripes in one place, where
it should be placed due to the periodicity. This place is
ﬁlled by the dielectric. This extra dielectric stripe contributes
to the dielectric contrast that results by adding the term
−ω2/c2(ε1(ω)−ε0)γ (|x−x0|)Ez(x) to the rhs in equation (2).
Here γ (|x −x0|) = 1 for |x −x0| ≤b, and γ (|x −x0|) = 0 for
|x −x0| > b, where x0 corresponds to the coordinate in the
middle of the 1D defect, which is the coordinate of the middle
of the absent graphene stripe. As a result we obtain the wave
equation for the electric ﬁeld for the 1D photonic crystal with
the defect:
∂2Ez(x)
∂x2
+ ω2
c2 (ε(x, ω) −(ε1(ω) −ε0)
× γ (|x −x0|))Ez(x) = 0.
(8)
Equation (8) describes the periodic array of stacks of
alternating graphene and dielectric stripes with the defect
formed by one stack of alternating graphene and dielectric
stripes being absent.
We solve the wave equation (8) to ﬁnd the eigenfrequency
corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized at the
defect formed by a background dielectric medium due to
the absence of a stack of alternating graphene and dielectric
stripes in one place where it should be placed due to the
periodicity. This wave equation is similar to the Schr¨odinger
equation describing the electron in the periodic potential
energy in the presence of the potential energy of the defect
placed at the point x0 given in appendix B. From the mapping
of the Klein–Gordon type equation given by equation (B.6)
the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in the graphene-based
photonic crystal has the following form:
−4k2
0c4

d2Ez(x)
dx2
−2ω22(ε1(ω) −ε0)
× γ (|x −x0|)Ez(x) = (ω4 −4)Ez(x),
(9)
where k0 = 2π/a is the vector of the 1D reciprocal lattice.
This Klein–Gordon type equation has the eigenvalue ω4−4.
In equation (9)  is the width of the forbidden band (photonic
gap) in the spectrum of the electromagnetic wave.
The
electric
ﬁeld
can
be
obtained
by
mapping
equations (B.7) and (B.9) that correspond to wavefunctions
of the stationary states. The continuity of the electric ﬁeld and
its derivative in the points x = x0 + b/2 and x0 −b/2 result in
the transcendental equation determining the spectrum of the
even states:
q

(11)
Solving equations (10) and (11) with respect to the
frequency ω, we obtain the frequency corresponding to the
photonic mode localized by the defect.
4. Discussion
In the calculations below we assume n0 = 1011 cm−2. For
simplicity, we consider the same material for the background
dielectric medium and the dielectric stripes between the
graphene stripes. As the dielectric material we consider SiO2
with the dielectric constant ε0 = 4.5. Using equation (7) we
calculated the band structure for 1D graphene-based photonic
crystal. The results of the calculations of the dispersion
relation of the photonic crystal are presented in ﬁgure 2. The
photonic band structure is calculated for different distances
between graphene layers d. In our calculations we used the
chemical potential for the electrons in graphene µ = 3.525 ×
10−21J, temperature T = 300 K, period of the 1D graphene
stripe array a = 25 × 10−6 m, and ﬁlling factor f = 0.3927.

Figure 2. The dispersion relation for the 1D graphene-based photonic crystal with a = 25 µm and ﬁlling factor f = 0.3927 for different
thicknesses of the dielectric between the graphene stripes.
According to the results of our calculations, the photonic
band structure almost does not depend on ε0 due to the fact
that ε0 ≪|ε1|. The results of our calculations demonstrate
the strong dependence of the photonic band structure on
the thickness d of the dielectric that separates the graphene
stripes. At d = 1 and 5 nm the distance between the lower
and upper dispersion curves is larger in the middle than at the
edges. At d = 3 and 10 nm the distance between the lower
and upper dispersion curves is larger at the edges than in the
middle.
Using
equations
(10)
and
(11)
we
calculate
the
frequencies corresponding to the electromagnetic wave
localized by the defect in the photonic crystal formed due to
the absence of a stack of alternating graphene and dielectric
stripes in one place where it should be placed due to the
periodicity. For a photonic crystal with the defect at d = 1 nm
we have ν = 1.79 THz, for the defect at d = 3 nm we have ν =
1.85 THz, for the defect at d = 5 nm we have ν = 3.91 THz,
and for the defect at d = 10 nm we have ν = 3.62 THz. All
these frequencies are located inside the photonic bandgap.
Let us mention that since our approach is based on the
Luttinger–Kohn model [39, 40], the localized frequency ν
does not depend on the momentum. The frequency localized
by the defect is just a constant in the photonic band structure,
which can be controlled by the thickness d of the dielectric
stripes that separate the graphene stripes, as well as by the
ﬁlling factor f and the period of the 1D array of graphene
stripes a.
In conclusion, the graphene-based photonic crystal
proposed in this paper is a novel type of one-dimensional
photonic crystal formed by an array of stacks of alternating
graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background
dielectric medium. This system can be analyzed as a 1D
photonic crystal and the corresponding wave equation for
the electromagnetic wave propagating in such a structure can
be solved in the framework of the Kronig–Penney model.
The frequency band structure is obtained analytically as a
function of the ﬁlling factor, the period of the 1D array of
graphene stripes and the thickness of the dielectric between
the graphene stripes. We obtain the photonic frequency
corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized at the
defect of a photonic crystal formed by a background dielectric
medium due to the absence of a stack of alternating graphene
and dielectric stripes in one place where it should be placed
due to the periodicity.

with the rectangular potential, b is the width of the rectangular

It is easy to see that the wave equation (2) with the
dielectric constant given by equation (3) can be mapped
onto the Schr¨odinger equation (A.1) for an electron in the
1D periodic potential corresponding to the Kronig–Penney
model. The mapping relations are the following ones:

Appendix B. The Dirac type equations for the
electromagnetic wave in the photonic crystal with
the defect
Following [15] we can map the wave equation for the photonic
crystal with the defect onto the Schr¨odinger equation in a
periodic ﬁeld with a defect. After mapping of equation (8)
onto the Schr¨odinger equation describing the electron with
the effective electron mass m0 in the periodic potential energy

Wγ (|x −x0|) placed at the point x0 we have

(B.1)
In equation (B.1) ψ(x) = Ez(x),
εω = ¯h2ω2
2m0c2 ,
the potential V(x) is given in equation (A.1) and the potential
W is deﬁned as
W = ¯h2ω2
2m0c2 (ε1(ω) −ε0).
(B.2)
Equation (B.1) has the same form as equation (6)
in [38]. However, in our case the potential W is deﬁned by
equation (B.2) and corresponds to the potential of the defect
in the Schr¨odinger equation for an ‘electron’ in the periodic
ﬁeld of the crystal lattice and in the presence of the defect.
We will reduce the problem of the Schr¨odinger equation
for a particle in the periodic potential V(x) related to the
system of periodically placed stacks of alternating graphene
and dielectric stripes embedded into a background dielectric
medium and a ‘defect potential’ W related to a defect to
a much simpler equation for the envelope wavefunctions.
Taking into account the two-band structure and following the
two-band model [38] we introduce a two-component spinor
wavefunction ψ(x):
ψ(x) =
 
ϕ(x)
χ(x)
!
,
(B.3)
where two different neighboring bands are described by
the wavefunctions ϕ(x) and χ(x). Note that equation (B.1)
contains both the periodic function V(x) corresponding to
the ideal lattice and W describing the potential of a defect.
Without a defect the energy spectrum would be described by
two neighboring bands and the gap between them. Applying
the standard two-band approach, we obtain an effective Dirac
type equation for the envelope spinor wavefunction, which
implies the periodicity provided by V(x) [15, 38].
Note that equation (B.1) describes an electron in the
periodic potential of an ideal crystal lattice V(x) and the
potential of the defect W. If the solution corresponding to
the absence of impurity W = 0 is known, the energy levels
of the electron localized by the defect can be obtained by
replacing equation (B.1) by a Dirac type equation according to
the Luttinger–Kohn model described in [38–40]. This model
implies a Dirac type equation for the two-component spinor
wavefunction. According to [38], the functions ϕn(x) and
χn(x) deﬁned as
ϕn(x) =
X
k
cn(k) exp[ikx/¯h],
χn(x) =
X
k′
dn(k
′) exp[ik′x/¯h]
(B.4)
satisfy the set of the second order partial differential equa-
tions. Considering only two neighboring bands corresponding
to the wavefunction ψ(x) given by equation (B.3) this set of
equations for ϕn(x) and χn(x) can be reduced to the Dirac type
equations for the two-component spinor equation (B.3), which
have the following form [38]:
[εω −1ω −Wγ (|x −x0|)]ϕ(x) + i¯hsσx
dχ(x)
dx
= 0,
[εω + 1ω −Wγ (|x −x0|)]χ(x) + i¯hsσx
dϕ(x)
dx
= 0,
(B.5)
where s = ¯hk0/(
√
3m0). In equation (B.5) σx is the Pauli
matrix and 1ω is the width of the forbidden band in the
electron spectrum that, as follows from the mapping of the
wave equation for the electric ﬁeld graphene-based photonic
crystal onto equation (B.1), is 1ω =

width of the forbidden band (photonic gap) in the spectrum
of the electromagnetic wave. Equations (B.5) are obtained in
the limit |ε2

of a quasiparticle as mω = 3m2
01ω/(¯h2k2
0), and following
the standard procedure of quantum electrodynamics [41, 42],
we obtain from the system of Dirac type equations (B.5)
the Klein–Gordon type equation. Note that the Klein–Gordon
equation can be reduced to a Schr¨odinger-like equation
with an effective energy and an effective potential. If
the potential is weak enough to ignore the W2 term,
the relativistic formalism becomes equivalent to the non-
relativistic formalism. More importantly, in situations where
the Klein–Gordon equation is not exactly solvable, the
Schr¨odinger form of the Klein–Gordon equation sheds some
light on the problem as it could be reduced to a solvable
eigenvalue problem:
