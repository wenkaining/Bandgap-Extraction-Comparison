We develop a scheme for building the scalar exchange-correlation XC kernel of time-dependent density
functional theory TDDFT from the tensorial kernel of time-dependent current density functional theory
TDCDFT and the Kohn-Sham current density response function. Resorting to the local approximation to the
kernel of TDCDFT results in a nonlocal approximation to the kernel of TDDFT, which is free of the contra-
dictions that plague the standard local density approximation LDA to TDDFT. As an application of this
general scheme, we calculate the dynamical XC contribution to the stopping power of electron liquids for slow
ions to ﬁnd that our results are in considerably better agreement with experiment than those obtained using
TDDFT in the conventional LDA.

I. INTRODUCTION
Starting with the pioneering work of Runge and Gross,1
time-dependent density functional theory TDDFT has
evolved into a powerful tool for studying excitations in
atomic, molecular, and condensed-matter systems.2–6 In the
linear-response regime, the key quantity of TDDFT is the
dynamical

and
correlation
XC

time of the functional derivative
fXCr,r,t −t = VXCr,t
nr,t ,
where VXC and n are the time-dependent XC potential and
particle density, respectively. In contrast with the XC poten-
tial in static DFT,7,8 the dynamical XC potential is strongly
nonlocal with respect to space coordinates,9 to the point that
a local-density approximation LDA, understood as the ze-
roth order term in a regular gradient expansion, does not
exist. Indeed, the use of LDA to treat genuinely dynamical
effects i.e., effects not captured by the adiabatic approxima-
tion is known to lead to severe contradictions within the
theory.10 Despite impressive successes of TDDFT, there is
still the want of a scheme for including nonlocality in XC
kernels, accurate enough and practically convenient in
applications.6
Contrary to ordinary TDDFT, the time-dependent current
density functional theory11 TDCDFT is known to allow a
consistent LDA, which is believed to be of about the same
level of accuracy for the time-dependent phenomena as the
standard LDA is for ground-state properties. In many con-
crete applications, however, including the calculation of the
stopping power of electron liquids described below it is the
scalar XC kernel of the ordinary TDDFT, rather than the
tensorial XC kernel of the TDCDFT, that naturally enters the
equations describing the many-body effects.
In this paper we exploit the fact that TDDFT and
TDCDFT would be completely equivalent if the exact XC
functionals were known, to construct a nonlocal approxima-
tion for the scalar XC kernel of TDDFT starting from the
LDA for the tensorial XC kernel of TDCDFT. As we shall
show below, the resulting nonlocal XC kernel of TDDFT
satisﬁes the exact zero-force sum rule, the violation of which
within LDA to TDDFT had once provided the motivation for
introducing TDCDFT.11
We believe that our nonlocal XC kernel has a broad range
of potential applications, particularly in transport theory. As a
ﬁrst demonstration of its usefulness, we present here the re-
sults of calculations of the stopping power of an electron
liquid for slow ions, wherein we ﬁnd that the contribution of
the many-body dynamical XC effects is not only numerically
important, but also leads to better agreement with experiment
when the new nonlocal expression for fXC is used in lieu of
the conventional LDA.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we
derive a formula expressing the exact scalar XC kernel of
TDDFT through the exact tensorial XC kernel of TDCDFT
and the Kohn-Sham current density response function. In
Sec. III we summarize the formal TDDFT of the stopping
power of an electron liquid for slow ions and discuss the
difﬁculties the LDA runs into. In Sec. IV we give the details
of our calculational procedure and present results and their
discussion. Section V contains our conclusions. The appen-
dix is devoted to the interrelations between scalar and tenso-
rial zero-force sum rules within the exact and approximate
theories.
II. SCALAR XC KERNEL OF TDDFT FROM THE
TENSORIAL XC KERNEL OF TDCDFT

Equation 5 is our desired and central result: It expresses the
scalar XC kernel of TDDFT in terms of its tensorial counter-
part of TDCDFT.
In the case of a bounded system, the exact scalar XC
kernel satisﬁes the zero-force sum rule10

6
where n0r and VXCr are, respectively, the ground-state
density and the XC potential. On the other hand, the tensorial
fˆXC and ˆ KS satisfy the corresponding sum rules of
TDCDFT.13 In the Appendix we prove an important result
that with any approximation to the tensorial fˆXC satisfying
the zero-force sum rule, the corresponding scalar XC kernel
of Eq. 5 satisﬁes the sum rule 6.
III. TDDFT OF THE STOPPING POWER
OF ELECTRON LIQUID
We now illustrate the usefulness of Eq. 5 by applying it
to the problem of the stopping power of an electron liquid for
slow ions.
A. Formal TDDFT of the stopping power of electron liquid
for a slow ion
The stopping power dE/dx is the loss of energy per unit
path of an ion moving through the electron liquid. The con-
stant of proportionality between dE/dx and the ion velocity
for low velocity deﬁnes the friction coefﬁcient Q, which
can be written as14
Q = Q1 + Q2,
where Q1 and Q2 are the single-particle and the many-body
dynamical
XC
contributions,
respectively.
The
single-
particle binary-collisions contribution Q1 can be expressed
as15–18
Q1 = n¯0kFtrkF,
7
where kF is the Fermi wave number, trkF is the transport
cross section of the elastic scattering in the KS potential of
an electron at the Fermi level, and n¯0 is the electron liquid
density in the absence of the ion. As shown in Ref. 14, keep-
ing the Q1 part of the friction coefﬁcient only is equivalent to
using the adiabatic version of TDDFT.
The many-body dynamical XC contribution Q2 is given
by14

where fXCr,r, is the scalar XC kernel of the inhomoge-
neous many-body system of an ion at rest in electron liquid
and vˆ is the unit vector in the direction of the ion velocity.
In the following, we focus on the calculation of Q2.

In the limit of zero density of the electron liquid n¯0→0, the
independent-electron part Q1 of Eq. 7 vanishes, but Q2 of
Eq. 10 gives a ﬁnite value, because the gradient of the

205103-2ground-state density n0r of an isolated atom is not zero and
 ImfXC,L
h
n,/=0 is negative.19 Thus LDA to the scalar
fxc yields a ﬁnite friction coefﬁcient even in the absence of
the electron gas, indicating an obvious ﬂaw of the approxi-
mation. Table I shows this error quantitatively for a number
of atoms in comparison with friction coefﬁcient at rs=2.2.
To check that Eq. 5 resolves this problem of the ﬁnite
friction coefﬁcient of free space, it is sufﬁcient to notice that
an isolated atom is a bounded system and hence the sum rule
6 holds, which, substituted into Eq. 8, yields zero identi-
cally. Moreover, LDA to TDCDFT satisﬁes the zero-force
sum rule by construction,11 ensuring, as is shown in the Ap-
pendix, that Eq. 6 holds for a bounded system even if the
local version of TDCDFT is used in Eq. 5.28
IV. CALCULATIONAL PROCEDURE, RESULTS,
AND DISCUSSION
Our numerical procedure is to evaluate and invert opera-
tors entering Eq. 5 on an orthonormal set of radial basis
functions. For ˆ KS,ij, we have employed the standard method
of using the static KS orbitals to build the independent-
electron response function

In Fig. 1, we plot the results at rs=1.59 corresponding to
the valence electron-density of carbon.30 It is instructive that
within 1Z114 both TDCDFT and TDDFT give virtually
the same result, which, we believe, is generally true for light
atoms in high-density electron liquid. Then, at higher Z1,
rather abruptly, the dynamical XC contribution almost van-
ishes in our present calculation, which can be understood
qualitatively recalling that for heavy atoms in the electron
liquid the charge-density distribution is close to that of iso-
lated atoms, and hence Q2 should be small.
In order to compare our result with experiment, we plot

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 205103 2007
205103-321 for ions moving with the velocity of 0.5 a.u. at the dis-
tance of 1.2 a.u. from the last atomic plane of the 111 sur-
face of aluminum. The inhomogeneity of the electron density
an ion travels through is weak under these conditions, and
we have used rs estimated experimentally.21 Moreover, the
experimental stopping power is predominantly electronic
since the trajectory of an ion is well separated from the lat-
tice atoms. All together, these two conditions justify the com-
parison with the theory within the electron liquid model. The
nonmonotonic dependence of the friction coefﬁcient on the
atomic number of the ion so-called Z1 oscillations is known
to result within the single-particle theory from the competi-
tion between the increase in the electron liquid-ion interac-
tion with the growing charge of the nucleus of the ion and its
decrease due to the screening by shells of bounded electrons
of the pseudoatom as well as its resonant states.18
While LDA to TDDFT triangles in Fig. 2 largely over-
estimates the friction coefﬁcient at Z15, the results using
Eq. 5 circles in Fig. 2 are in good agreement with the
experiment in a wide range of 3Z118. A deviation oc-
curs at small and large Z1, where the experimental friction
coefﬁcient is lower than the independent-electrons calcula-
tions open squares in Fig. 2. This feature has recently been
reported as due to the ﬁnite velocity of ions.22 Hence it is an
effect of the deviation from linear dependence of stopping
power on velocity. The same effect gives a positive contribu-
tion at 8Z112, suggesting that combined with the many-
body effects of the present theory the agreement with experi-
ment can be further improved.31 In the range 13Z117,
the dynamical many-body effects seem to be solely respon-
sible for the enhancement of the friction coefﬁcient com-
pared with the independent-electron theory.
In Fig. 3, we plot the friction coefﬁcient at rs=2 versus
the atomic number of ions in the range 5Z139. This is
compared with the available measured stopping power for
ions with the velocity of 0.68 a.u. channeled along the 110
direction in gold. Due to the channeling, collisions with the
lattice atoms again do not give signiﬁcant contribution to the
stopping power. It must be noted, however, that under chan-
neling conditions the assumption of the nearly constant elec-
tron density is an uncontrolled approximation. One important
qualitative conclusion we can draw from comparison of the
theory and experiment in this case is that for Z122 the role
of dynamical XC effects becomes negligible in both experi-
ment and the present theory, while LDA to the TDDFT yields
these effects largely overestimated. Similar to the dip in Fig.
2, the underestimated theoretical values at 7Z112 can be
attributed to the effect of ﬁnite velocity.22 However, within
the range 16Z119 the dynamical XC contribution is too
small to account for the onset at the experimental data, nor
can the persistent enhancement of the friction coefﬁcient in
this range be attributed to the effect of ﬁnite velocity within
the independent-particle theory. Further studies are required
to elucidate the nature of this onset, the inhomogeneity of
electron density being the most plausible cause. The dotted
line in Fig. 3 represents the friction coefﬁcient of silver ob-
tained with the dynamical electron-electron interactions in-
cluded in Ref. 25 within the framework of the linear-
response theory of the homogeneous electron gas. In the case
of the nondegenerate plasma, an approach similar to that of
Ref. 25 has been reported in Refs. 26 and 27.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have rigorously expressed the dynamical XC kernel
fXCr,r, of TDDFT in the terms of its TDCDFT tensorial
counterpart and the Kohn-Sham current density response
function of independent electrons. Then, using the local den-
sity approximation to TDCDFT, we have built a nonlocal
approximation to fXCr,r, which satisﬁes the exact zero-
force sum rule for bounded systems. We believe that our new
approximation will be broadly applicable to a variety of
problems in electronic transport theory.

205103-4As a ﬁrst application, we have calculated the dynamical
XC contribution to the stopping power of an electron liquid
for slow ions. In doing so we have resolved a basic difﬁculty
of the conventional LDA—the ﬁnite friction coefﬁcient of
free space—and we have improved the overall agreement
between theory and experiment.

In this appendix, we prove that for any approximation to
fˆXC satisfying the sum rule A1, the corresponding scalar
fXC obtained through Eq.5 satisﬁes the sum rule of Eq. 6.
First, the validity of Eq. A2 is independent on an approxi-
mation for fˆXC, and it can be veriﬁed directly with use of the
explicit representation of ˆ KS of Eq. 11. Second, Eq. A3
holds if Eqs. A1 and A2 hold as can be seen by easily
inverting the arguments of Ref. 13 leading from Eqs. A2

The next step involves integration by parts requiring the re-

28Notice that the sum rule 6 does not hold for an extended system:
This is why Q2 is different from zero for an electron liquid of
ﬁnite density.
29We have used the zero-temperature viscosities, which are valid
for ≫T2/EF. This is justiﬁed since in the experimentally ac-
cessible regime 0.1 a.u. and T2/EF10−6 a.u. at room tem-
perature.

al., Can. J. Phys. 57, 645 1979; G. Högberg, Phys. Status
Solidi B 46, 829 1971 is predominantly determined by colli-
sions with lattice atoms, making it meaningless to compare with
electron gas model calculations.
31Reference 22 attributes the overestimation by Ref. 14 of the role
of the many-body effects to the use of the total ground-state
density rather than that of the delocalized states only. The total
density is, however, the basic variable of TDDFT and without
any assumptions it enters the rigorous result of Eq. 8. The real
source of the overestimation of the dynamical XC in Ref. 14
was, as Ref. 14 had anticipated and the present work shows, use
of LDA within TDDFT.
