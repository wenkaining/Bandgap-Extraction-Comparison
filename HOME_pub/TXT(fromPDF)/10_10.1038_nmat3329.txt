Possible valence-bond condensation in the
frustrated cluster magnet LiZn2Mo3O8
J. P. Sheckelton, J. R. Neilson, D. G. Soltan and T. M. McQueen*
The emergence of complex electronic behaviour from simple
ingredients has resulted in the discovery of numerous states
of matter. Many examples are found in systems exhibiting
geometric magnetic frustration, which prevents simultaneous
satisfaction of all magnetic interactions. This frustration gives
rise to complex magnetic properties such as chiral spin
structures1–3, orbitally driven magnetism4, spin-ice behaviour5
exhibiting Dirac strings with magnetic monopoles6, valence-
bond solids7,8 and spin liquids9,10. Here we report the synthesis
and characterization of LiZn2Mo3O8, a geometrically frustrated
antiferromagnet in which the magnetic moments are localized
on small transition-metal clusters rather than individual
ions11–13. By doing so, ﬁrst-order Jahn–Teller instabilities
and orbital ordering are prevented, allowing the strongly
interacting magnetic clusters in LiZn2Mo3O8 to probably
give rise to an exotic condensed valence-bond ground state
reminiscent of the proposed resonating valence-bond state14,15.
Our results also link magnetism on clusters to geometric
magnetic frustration in extended solids, demonstrating a new
approach for unparalleled chemical control and tunability
in the search for collective, emergent electronic states
of matter16,17.
Numerous
materials
possess
a
geometrically
frustrated
arrangement of magnetic atoms; such materials have their magnetic
moments arranged on frustrated topologies such as triangular
lattices18,19, kagome lattices20,21, hyper-kagome lattices22
and
edge-sharing tetrahedra23,24. A rich diversity of properties result
depending on the magnitude of the per-site spin and orbital
occupancies. Yet, the presence of local structural distortions25,26,
and a degree of site mixing between non-magnetic and magnetic
layers27 are still key limiters in the quest for new quantum states
of matter28. Here we show that these problems can be overcome
through the use of clusters in which a magnetic, unpaired electron
is delocalized over a small number of transition-metal atoms,
rather than individual magnetic ions, by demonstrating that the
S=1/2 cluster magnet LiZn2Mo3O8 is geometrically frustrated and
probably possesses a condensed valence-bond ground state.
LiZn2Mo3O8 is built of discrete Mo3O13 cluster units (Fig. 1a),
in which all Mo atoms are on equivalent crystallographic sites29.
The average formal oxidation state of Mo is +3.67. Each
cluster has seven valence electrons. By a simple electron count,
supported by molecular orbital calculations (Fig. 1b), six of
these electrons localize into Mo–Mo bonds holding the cluster
together. The seventh electron remains unpaired in a totally
symmetric (A1 irreducible representation) molecular orbital with
equal contributions from all three Mo atoms. The result is one
S=1/2 magnetic moment on each Mo3O13 cluster. This cluster can

then replace an atom as the basic building block of a geometrically
frustrated magnetic system, when appropriately arranged. There
have been previous reports of systems built of magnetic clusters30.
In those cases, the unpaired, magnetic electrons within a cluster
are still (just like the non-cluster cases) localized on individual
atoms. In contrast, in LiZn2Mo3O8, the magnetism arises from a
collective contribution of all three atoms in the Mo3O13 cluster. This
gives rise to a S = 1/2 moment delocalized over three Mo atoms.
This delocalized nature of the moment contributes to the stability
of the system and renders the structure impervious to first-order
Jahn–Teller distortions.
These Mo3O13 clusters in LiZn2Mo3O8 connect at corners, mak-
ing a two-dimensional Mo3O8 layer (Fig. 1c). The 2.6 Å Mo–Mo
distance within each cluster is substantially shorter than between
clusters (3.2 Å), reflecting strong metal–metal bonding within each
cluster. These Mo3O8 layers are separated by non-magnetic Li/Zn
ions (Fig. 1d) to form the full structure with R3m symmetry.
Consequently, LiZn2Mo3O8 contains two-dimensional layers in
which S = 1/2 Mo3O13 clusters are arranged on the geometrically
frustrated triangular lattice.
The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of
LiZn2Mo3O8 shows unusual and unexpected behaviour. At tem-
peratures above 96 K, the inverse magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 2a)
is well described by the Curie–Weiss law for paramagnetic spins.
A Weiss temperature of θ = −220 K indicates a net mean-field
antiferromagnetic interaction between unpaired spins on Mo3O13
clusters. A Curie constant of C = 0.24 e.m.u. K Oe−1 mol f u−1
(peff = 1.39) is reduced from the ideal 0.375 value for a free
S = 1/2 moment. This may be due to a number of possibilities
(see Supplementary Information), but the most likely is a partial
unquenched orbital contribution to the moment, due to spin–orbit
coupling. It is not due to the formation of a metallic state: re-
sistivity data (Supplementary Fig. S6) show that LiZn2Mo3O8 is
electrically insulating at all accessible temperatures. Furthermore,
the molecular calculations predict an on-site (cluster) Hubbard
U of ∼1.2 eV, which, depending on bandwidth, could open a
gap and explain the insulating behaviour. Together, these data
imply that the one unpaired electron per cluster in LiZn2Mo3O8
behaves as a localized effective S = 1/2 magnetic system (with a
partial unquenched orbital contribution just like Co2+ or Cu2+),
and that the magnetic interactions between clusters are strong and
antiferromagnetic.
A change in the slope of the inverse magnetic suscepti-
bility as a function of temperature occurs around T = 96 K,
with a second linear region of χ(T) present below this tran-
sition (or crossover). A fit to the linear region from T = 2 K
to T = 96 K gives a Weiss temperature of θ = −14 K and a

Curie constant of C = 0.08. This Curie constant is one-third
that of the high-temperature value, indicating that two-thirds
of the spins contribute negligibly to the magnetic suscepti-
bility below T = 96 K as the Curie constant scales with the
number of moments.
Neutron powder diffraction experiments at T = 12 K indicate
that long-range magnetic order does not develop below the
T ≈96 K transition (Supplementary Fig. S1). Instead, our results
are consistent with two-thirds of the effective spins condensing
into magnetic singlets. Although our data are not sufficient to
unambiguously determine whether these singlets are static, making
a valence-bond solid, or dynamic, making a resonating valence-
bond state, neutron powder diffraction data suggest that the singlets
are indeed dynamic: at T = 12 K, LiZn2Mo3O8 maintains the
trigonal R3m symmetry that exists at T = 300 K. In most cases,
static singlets form a valence-bond network and distort the lattice
to a lower symmetry. Unambiguous determination of the ground
state warrants further study, but the ground state of LiZn2Mo3O8 is
unusual and reflective of the strong geometric magnetic frustration.
Changes in the experimentally measured heat capacity fur-
ther elucidate the unusual electronic behaviour in LiZn2Mo3O8
(Fig. 2b). LiZn2Mo3O8 does not undergo a transition to long-range
magnetic order above T = 0.1 K: there is no sharp λ transition of
the heat capacity as a function of temperature. Instead there is only
an upturn in the specific heat capacity data below T = 1 K. Applied
magnetic fields of µoH =1 T and µoH =9 T (Fig. 2b inset) radically
modulate the behaviour of the low-temperature data. Such large
changes from small magnetic fields are surprising given the large
Weiss temperature and are probably a result of magnetic frustration
in the system. Geometric frustration prevents the formation of
long-range order and results in low-lying magnetic excitations
perturbed by an applied field. Simple models, such as a multilevel
Schottky anomaly, do not adequately describe the low-temperature
data (see Supplementary Information); further studies are needed
to examine and understand the behaviour in detail.
The magnetic entropy change of LiZn2Mo3O8, accounting for
the extra lattice contribution from lithium when compared with
Zn2Mo3O8 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S2), also indicates
the condensation of two-thirds of the available spins. The total
expected magnetic entropy change for a S = 1/2 system is
R ·ln(2)(= 5.76 J K−1 mol fu−1), compared with the experimental
value of 8(3) J K−1 mol fu−1 from T = 0.1 to T = 400 K. On
cooling from T = 400 K, we observe a gradual and continuous
loss of entropy, approximately two-thirds of the expected S = 1/2
value from T = 400 K to T = 100 K. Critically, the change in
the linear regions of magnetic susceptibility is not accompanied
by a sharp transition in the entropy, supporting the claim that
these spins condense into singlets, rather than adopt long-range

magnetic order. Furthermore, the difference in entropy between
T = 0.1 K and T = 100 K is approximately 1/3R·ln(2), consistent
with freezing out of the remaining one-third of spins that did not
condense into singlets at T = 96 K.
The resulting magnetic phase diagram of LiZn2Mo3O8 is shown
in Fig. 2d. Near room temperature, the system is paramagnetic and
the spins thermally randomize. Cooling below the condensation
temperature (T ∼96 K), two-thirds of the spins form a condensed
valence-bond state. The remaining one-third of the spins are still
paramagnetic and interacting antiferromagnetically until lower
temperatures, at which point they lose entropy in a yet-to-
be determined manner.
These results indicate that LiZn2Mo3O8 exhibits geometric mag-
netic frustration between S = 1/2 magnetic clusters and two-thirds
of the spins condense into singlets below approximately T = 96 K.
Therefore, LiZn2Mo3O8 is a candidate for a resonating valence-
bond state, as there is no evidence for static singlets. More generally,
our results show how an extended lattice of magnetic clusters, in
place of magnetic ions, produces exotic physics while providing
numerous advantages in the design and control of magnetically
frustrated materials. This approach opens a new chemical frontier
in the search for emergent phenomena in frustrated systems.
Methods
Phase-pure LiZn2Mo3O8 was synthesized from a mixture of Mo, ZnO,
Li2MoO4 and MoO2 (99 + % purity) with an overall starting formula of
LiZn2Mo3O8(Li2Zn2O3)0.2. Mo was used as received. ZnO and Li2MoO4 were
dried at T = 160 ◦C overnight. MoO2 was purified by heating overnight under
flowing 5% H2/95% Ar. The mixtures were pressed into pellets, placed in alumina
crucibles and double-sealed in evacuated, fused-silica tubes. The reaction vessel
was heated to T = 600 ◦C for 24 h, ramped to T = 1,000 ◦C at 10 ◦C h−1, held for
12 h, followed by a water quench. The sample was reground and heated again in the
same manner. Zn2Mo3O8 was synthesized in a similar manner, but with 3% excess
ZnO and a final temperature of T =1,050 ◦C.
Magnetization measurements, heat capacities and resistivities were measured
on a sintered pellet in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement
System using a dilution refrigerator for T < 2 K measurements. Heat capacities
were measured three times at each temperature using the semi-adiabatic pulse
technique, waiting for three time constants per measurement. Data were collected
from T = 0.05 K to T = 400 K under magnetic fields of µoH = 0 T, µoH = 1 T and
µoH = 9 T. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured from T = 1.8 K to T = 320 K
under a µoH = 1 T field. Laboratory X-ray powder diffraction patterns were
collected using Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer
