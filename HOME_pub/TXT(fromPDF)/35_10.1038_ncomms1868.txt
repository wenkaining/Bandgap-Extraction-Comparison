Non-long terminal repeat Retrotransposons are referred to as long interspersed nuclear 
elements (LINEs) and their non-autonomous partners are short interspersed nuclear elements 
(SINEs). It is believed that an active SINE copy, upon retrotransposition, generates near 
identical copies of itself, which subsequently accumulate mutations resulting in sequence 
polymorphism. Here we show that when a retrotransposition-competent cell line of the 
parasitic protist Entamoeba histolytica, transfected with a marked SINE copy, is induced to 
retrotranspose,  > 20% of the newly retrotransposed copies are neither identical to the marked 
SINE nor to the mobilized resident SINEs. Rather they are recombinants of resident SINEs and 
the marked SINE. They are a consequence of retrotransposition and not DNA recombination, 
as they are absent in cells not expressing the retrotransposition functions. This high-frequency 
recombination provides a new explanation for the existence of mosaic SINEs, which may 
impact on genetic analysis of SINE lineages, and measurement of phylogenetic distances.

etrotransposons of the non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) 
category are generally referred to as long interspersed nuclear 
elements (LINEs) and their non-autonomous partners are 
called short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)1. SINEs are 
extremely efficient genome invaders. The most well-known SINE, 
the human Alu element is found in 1.1 million copies in the human 
genome2. Individual SINE copies typically show extensive sequence 
polymorphism3–5. How this polymorphism is generated is not clear, 
and direct sequence comparison of newly retrotransposed SINE 
copies with their ‘source’ copy has not been reported. It should be 
possible to address this issue using retrotransposition-competent 
cell lines. In vivo retrotransposition of the human LINE, L16 in cul­
tured cells, and SINEs, Alu7 and SVA8,9; and a LINE/SINE pair from 
eel10, have been well documented. However, analysis of sequence 
changes in retrotransposed copies compared with the marked SINE 
copy after a round of retrotransposition has been limited.
We have been studying the LINE and SINE elements in the early 
branching parasitic protist Entamoeba histolytica. These retrotrans­
posons comprise ~11% of the 23-Mb genome11–13. EhLINEs belong 
to the R2 group of non-LTR retrotransposons14–16. EhLINEs/SINEs 
are generally located in intergenic regions11,13, but not within genes. 
The 4.8-kb EhLINE1 contains two open reading frames (ORFs) 
(Fig. 1a). ORF2 encodes the reverse transcriptase (RT) and endo­
nuclease (EN) activities typically required for non-LTR element 
retrotransposition6,17–19. EhSINE1 (550 bp) is the likely non-
autonomous partner of EhLINE1. The two share a 78-bp stretch 
of sequence homology at their 3′ ends (Fig. 1a)10,11,20. Of the 742 
EhLINE1 copies in the E. histolytica genome, 88 are full-length, but 
they lack complete ORFs13. Therefore to study retrotransposition in 
these cells it is necessary to generate a cell line that expresses both 
ORFs of EhLINE1. Here we report the construction of such a cell 
line, which expresses ORF2 in a tetracycline (tet)-inducible manner, 
and can retrotranspose a SINE copy in the presence of tet. This is the 
first report of active retrotransposition in a parasitic protist cell line. 
Using this system, we demonstrate a novel feature of high-frequency 
recombination between SINE copies during retrotransposition.
Results
A retrotransposition-competent E. histolytica cell-line. Although 
EhSINE1 transcripts are abundantly present in E. histolytica 
cells21,22, full-length transcripts of EhLINE1 are not detected 
(Fig. 1b). We show that E. histolytica cells maintained in the lab 
express ORF1p (Fig. 1c), but fail to express detectable levels of 
ORF2p; hence these cells are not expected to be retrotransposition 
competent.
The study of active retrotransposition requires the construction 
of a cell line expressing the LINE-encoded ORFs, as achieved with 
human L16, which could also retrotranspose SINEs, such as Alu7 
and SVA8,9. To express the functions required for retrotransposition, 
we reconstructed the complete ORF2 (lacking any stop codons) by 
overlapping PCR (Fig. 2a), cloned it in a tet-inducible expression 
vector (Fig. 2b) and introduced it into E. histolytica cells to obtain 
the cell line Eh-ORF2. Our strategy to measure retrotransposition 
was to introduce in this cell line a plasmid containing a marked 
EhSINE1 copy (with a 25-bp GC-rich tag), and a known target site 
of EhSINE1 insertion15 (Fig. 2c). The sequence used as the target 
site for insertion was identified in a previous study in which we had 
looked for ‘empty’ sites in the genome, where a SINE element was 
missing in one chromosomal copy, but had inserted in another copy 
of the E. histolytica polyploid genome. The empty versus occupied 
site was differentiated by PCR amplification with flanking primers. 
The target site used in this assay was one such sequence with an 
empty site15. Hence, it is a sequence used by the E. histolytica retro­
transposition machinery for SINE insertion in vivo.
Retrotransposition events occurring at this target site were 
scored without using selection pressure. Being PCR-based, we 
expect the scoring to be very sensitive. The doubly transfected cell 
line (Eh-ORF2-SN) expressed 2.9 kb ORF2 transcript (Fig. 3a) and 
ORF2p (111 kDa) (Fig. 3b) in a tet-inducible manner. The constitu­
tive expression of ORF1p (60 kDa) was unaltered on tet induction 
(Fig 3b). This cell line also expressed the transcript corresponding 
to the marked SINE1 (Fig 3c). In the presence of tet, this cell line is 
expected to be retrotransposition competent. We added tet to cul­
tures in early log phase and harvested the cells after 48 h (late log). 
We scored retrotransposition of the marked SINE copy to the inser­
tion target site by PCR amplification of total genomic DNA using 
two sets of primer pairs to discount the possibility of PCR artefacts 
(Fig. 4). The identity of the amplicons was further confirmed by 
Southern hybridization with the marked SINE probe. We did not 
obtain amplicons in the absence of tet, whereas in the presence of 
tet, specific amplicons expected from the mobilization of the marked 
SINE to the insertion site were obtained with both primer pairs 
(Fig. 4a,b). We also did not obtain amplicons when tet was added 
to a cell line containing the marked SINE and insertion hotspot 
but lacking ORF2 (Eh-SN). A hallmark of retrotransposition is the 
generation of target site duplications (TSD). We induced retrotrans­
position by tet addition in three independently grown cultures and

Figure 1 | Expression of EhLINE1 and EhSINE1 in normally proliferating 
E. histolytica. (a) Organization of EhLINE1 and EhSINE111. The ORF2 
contains RT and EN domains15. The sequence similarity of 78 bp between 
EhLINE1 and EhSINE1 at their 3′ ends is shown by a solid black bar. The 
region marked ‘C’ (100 bp) in EhSINE1 is conserved in all EhSINEs and may 
contain the SINE promoter12. (b) Northern hybridization was performed 
with total cellular RNA isolated from normally proliferating trophozoites 
with the hybridization probes as indicated in (a). The 0.55-kb band 
corresponds to EhSINE1 and is seen with ORF2 probe containing the 
78-bp common 3′-end. No full-length EhLINE1 transcripts of 4.8 kb are 
seen. Instead the ORF1 and 2 probes hybridize with a 1.5-kb band, which 
probably corresponds to transcripts from the abundant truncated EhLINE 
copies11. (c) Western blotting followed by immunodetection with affinity-
purified anti-ORF1 and anti-EN antibodies was performed using total 
cellular lysate. Band of 60 kDa (ORF1p) is indicated. Anti-actin antibody 
was used for loading control.ARTICLE

sequenced the flanking sequences of thirteen random clones of the 
amplicons. We predominantly found a 22-bp TSD (Fig. 4c), which 
matched exactly in size and sequence with the TSD found at this 
insertion hotspot at its genomic location15. We did not find insertion 
at any region in the 176-bp fragment other than the hotspot. There­
fore, based on three criteria namely, strict requirement of ORF2p 
expression for mobilization, specific insertion into the retrotranspo­
sition hotspot and the 22-bp TSDs accompanying the insertion, we 
conclude that the events scored by us are due to retrotransposition 
and not due to DNA recombination. This is the first demonstration 
of active retrotransposition in a primitive protist.
Analysis of the newly retrotransposed copies of EhSINEs. Next 
we checked the sequences of the newly retrotransposed copies. To 
recover all retrotransposition events due to SINEs, we obtained 
amplicons using the primer pair C1/C2 (Fig. 4d), which gave a 1.4 kb 
amplicon from the parent plasmid and a 2.0 kb amplicon expected 
from events where a SINE copy had retrotransposed at the inser­
tion hotspot. We did not obtain bands shorter than 2.0 kb, which 
shows that in our system the predominant retrotransposition events 
are contributed by full-length SINEs. This is expected, as truncated 
SINE transcripts are not seen, whereas full-length transcripts are 
abundant in E. histolytica23,24. This also shows that 5′-truncations

Figure 2 | Construction of complete ORF2 and pEh-ORF2 and pEh-SN plasmids. (a) Overlapping GSS clones having maximum similarity with consensus 
sequence of ORF2 of EhLINE1 and lacking any stop codons were selected for reconstruction of ORF2. PCR-amplified fragments of the indicated GSS 
clones were used in an overlapping PCR to obtain 2,060 bp fragment containing the RT domain, which was later stitched with previously cloned fragment 
containing the EN domain15 to obtain DNA sequence of the full-length ORF2. It was cloned in pET30b vector at KpnI-BamHI sites. Accession numbers 
of GSS clones are given in brackets K-KpnI, B-BamHI, E-EcoRI. (b) Cloning of ORF2 in place of CAT in the tet-inducible vector pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT at 
KpnI and BamHI sites to get pEh-ORF2. The 5′- and 3′-actin and 5′-lectin sequences contain regulatory sequences from the E. histolytica genes to drive 
transcription. A sequence of 19 bp inserted between TATA box and ATTCA initiator element in lectin promoter, which acts as a TetR-operator is shown30. 
(c) Cloning of marked EhSINE1 and insertion target site in E. histolytica vector pEh-Neo-LUC. A 25-bp GC-rich DNA tag (with no match with E. histolytica 
genome) was inserted at position 250 from 5′-end in EhSINE1 (555 bp). To insert this tag, the EhSINE1 was first PCR amplified in two fragments, that is, 
270 and 325 bp with primer pairs S1-D2 and D1-S2, respectively. The primers D2 and D1 contained an overhang of 20 nucleotides each at their 5′-end 
corresponding to the tag sequence and had 15 nucleotides complementary to each other. These two fragments were used as templates in a second PCR 
with primers S1–S2 to yield the 580-bp marked EhSINE1 with 25 bp GC-rich tag. This was cloned in KpnI and BamHI restriction sites by replacing the 
1.65-kb LUC. A genomic target site for EhSINE insertion was also provided by inserting the 176-bp DNA fragment containing this site, downstream to 
3′-actin sequence at the HindIII (H) site. This site corresponds to the endonuclease nicking hot spot #3 in this fragment, which has been previously 
described15. It is located 76 nucleotides from 5′-end of this fragment.ARTICLE

are not common during EhSINE retrotransposition. We cut out 
the 2.0-kb band and reamplified it using the primer pair B1/B2 
(Fig. 4). We cloned the 0.8-kb amplicon so obtained, and sequenced 
23 randomly selected clones. The data showed that the sequences 
belonged to three different categories (Table 1) namely; Set I, a set 
of ten sequences matching completely with the marked SINE; Set II, 
a set of eight sequences lacking the tag and matching with genomic 
SINE copies; and Set III, a set of five sequences containing the 25-bp 
tag at the expected location but, otherwise, matching with genomic 
SINEs rather than the marked SINE. In these five instances of set III, 
the tag had associated itself with genomic SINE sequences. Char­
acteristics of each set are as follows. Of the ten sequences in set I, 
seven were 100% identical to the marked SINE, and three had one 
mismatch each. The nucleotide position of the mismatch is indi­
cated in Table 1, and shows that the mismatches are not clustered. 
In set II, all eight sequences lacked the tag and showed only 95–96% 
sequence identity (19–27 mismatches) with the marked SINE. As 
this level of identity is seen between random genomic EhSINE1 cop­
ies, these sequences would not have arisen from the marked SINE. 
Rather they may correspond to genomic SINEs. It is estimated that 
142 SINE copies are transcribed in E. histolytica12, some of which 
may be mobilized in our cell line upon tet induction.Sequence com­
parison showed that seven of the eight sequences in set II indeed 
showed 98–99% identity with genomic EhSINE1 sequences found 
in the E. histolytica EST database (3–11 mismatches with best 
data base hits when compared with the full-length SINE sequence; 
Table 1, set II). The number of mismatches seen in separate compar­
isons of 5′-half and 3′-half with the EhSINE1 sequences in the data 
base is explained later. We confirmed that the database comparison 
was valid, as random check of PCR amplicons from four of these 
loci from our cultured cells showed 100% sequence match with the 
database. These events therefore resulted from the mobilization 
of transcribed genomic SINE copies and not from the marked 
SINE copy.
In set III, all five sequences had the 25-bp tag but, surprisingly, 
showed only 94–95% overall sequence identity (22–27 mismatches) 
with the marked SINE. When we searched these sequences (minus 
the tag) for identical hits in the E. histolytica data base we found 
at best 94–98% matches (11–28 mismatches in the full length 
SINE sequence). However, when we searched the sequence on 
either side of the tag separately (5′-half and 3′-half of each SINE 
separately; Table 1, set III), 98–100% matches were obtained, and 
each side matched with different genomic SINE sequences (acces­
sion codes are provided in Supplementary Table S1). Thus it seems 
that these five sequences are recombinants, derived from at least 
three different SINE sequences, one of them being the marked 
SINE and two belonging to different genomic SINEs. If the tag was 
acquired by the genomic SINE copies through a DNA-recombi­

nation event before retrotransposition, the tag should be present 
in the transcripts of these SINEs. To check this, we took total 
RNA from Eh-ORF2-SN cells induced with tet and did RT–PCR 
in two parts using primers from the tag and from SINE sequences 
at either end (Fig. 5a,b). We sequenced ten random clones of the 
amplicons from each side. All clones were identical only to the 
marked SINE sequence, showing that tag-containing transcripts 
arose only from the marked SINE copy. To further check if the 
recombinants existed before the induction of retrotransposition, 
we performed genomic PCR with DNA from Eh-ORF2-SN 
cells before tet addition using primers from the tag and opposite 
primers specific to the five mobilized copies of set III (Fig. 5c). 
No amplicons were obtained with this DNA, whereas DNA from 
cells after tet addition gave the expected amplicons, showing that 
the tag was not associated with these sequences before retrotrans­
position.
We conclude that recombinant SINEs are formed consequent to 
retrotransposition. The process is rapid, as we scored these events 
within 48 h of retrotransposition induction, and occurs at high fre­
quency ( > 20% of total events scored). Some of the events in set II 
might also be recombinants, as the number of mismatches reduced 
when the 5′ and 3′ halves of each sequence were searched separately 
with the database (Table 1). Although the number of mismatches in 
a full-length comparison ranged from 3 to 20, this number became 
0 to 4 when matches were searched only for the 5′-half, and was 
0 to 5 when matches were searched for the 3′-half. In two cases the 
sequence had to be matched in three parts (5′, 3′, and middle) to get 
minimum mismatches.
Discussion
Retrotransposition-competent cell lines have greatly assisted in 
understanding the mechanism of non-LTR retrotransposition 
in vivo6–10. Here we report the first such system in a parasitic protist 
E. histolytica. Our results show that in this organism the newly 
retrotransposed EhSINE copies undergo high-frequency recombi­
nation, not known earlier to take place in this class of non-LTR ret­
rotransposons. Chimeric molecules arising from reverse transcripts 
have been observed in yeast Ty elements, and were attributed to 
gene conversion23, whereas in retroviruses high-frequency recom­
bination occurs during reverse transcription of the two co-packaged 
RNAs in the virion as a result of template switching24. In non-LTR 
elements, tripartite chimeric LINEs have earlier been reported in

ene chimeras have been experimentally demonstrated26. However, 
recombination between multiple copies of the same SINE family 
during retrotransposition is a novel observation.
The demonstrated properties of RT to displace the RNA template 
during complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, and to perform 
multiple template jumping27,28 could lead to these recombinants. 
The template jumping activity reported for non-LTR retro­
transposons involves end-to-end jumping between the template 
RNAs, and this is frequently accompanied by the addition of non-
templated nucleotides at the junction. The recombinant SINEs 
reported here are not generated by end-to-end jumping. They 
would require the RT to switch at internal positions from one tem­
plate RNA to the next. Such switching has not been reported for 
the RT encoded by non-LTR elements and needs to be explored 
further. Our data (Table 1) suggests that, more frequently, no 
switches take place during retrotransposition (at least 10 out of 23 
occurrences; set I); but multiple switching events are commonly 
encountered. In set II, four events (sequences 2, 3, 4 and 8) probably 
did not involve any switch, whereas two (numbers 1 and 7) could 
involve one switch each, and the remaining two (numbers 5 and 6) 
could involve two switches each. In set III, all five events seemed 
to be a result of two switches. This may be due to the small sample 
size in this set.
If such recombination is indeed common, one should expect 
the E. histolytica SINE population to display a prominent mosaic 
structure. To check this, we did multiple alignment of 63 full-length 
EhSINE1 copies thought to have retrotransposed most recently12, 
and looked at all positions that were polymorphic in at least 20% of 
the SINEs. We found 16 such positions. We organized the sequences 
in these positions in blocks of four, and clustered the positions with 
identical sequences into sets in the leftmost block (Fig. 6). Upon 
aligning these sequences with the next block of four, it is evident 
that the sequences of identical sets in the first block segregate out 
and associate in various combinations. Nine sets in the first block 
associated with twelve sets in the second block in 34 different com­
binations. The combination of patterns in all four blocks taken 
together showed clear indication of mosaic formations that would

be expected to arise from internal template jumps during retro­
transposition.
Although sequence analysis of human Alu subfamilies showed 
the existence of mosaic elements29, these were not experimentally 
found7–9. Mosaics could have been missed in these studies because 
of the smaller number of retrotransposition events scored, and the 
selection pressure used. Our results are the first direct demonstra­
tion that SINE copies engage in active sequence exchange during 
retrotransposition, leading to the rapid spread of the sequence tag 
to the SINE population, and generation of diversity. As mRNA tran­
scripts are also templates of the same retrotransposition machin­
ery during retropseudogene formation, it will be interesting to see 
if mRNA transcripts could also engage in similar recombination 
during reverse transcription29.
Methods
Cell culture and growth conditions. Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM-1:
IMSS (clone 6) were axenically maintained and stable transfectants were obtained 
as described previously30. Single and double transfectants were maintained with 
10 µg ml − 1 of Hygromycin B or G418 or both.
Immunodetection. Western analysis was performed with 100 µg of total cell 
lysates separated on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted 
using Mini-Trans Blot Electrophoretic Cell (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies, 
anti-EN (mouse) and anti-ORF1 (rabbit) were raised against each his-tagged 
recombinant protein purified through Ni-NTA agarose. 1:5,000 dilution of 
each anti-serum followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000, 
Sigma) were used to detect respective polypeptides. ECL reagents were used for 
visualization (Millipore).
DNA sequence analysis. The genome sequence of E. histolytica having 1529 scaf­
folds was downloaded from NCBI database, with accession IDs AAFB00000000, 
and was searched (using BLAST tool) for matches with the sequences of retrotrans­
posed copies of Sets II and III (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). In all, 25 
nucleotides from both the ends of these copies were removed before BLAST analy­
sis to remove any bias due to other factors (for example, addition of non-templated 
nucleotides during the RT reaction). Hits showing 100% coverage and maximum 
similarity were recorded. The coordinates of EhSINEs in various scaffolds are as 
per previous report12.

Figure 5 | Sequence changes in SINEs were not due to transcription or genomic recombination. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the Eh-ORF2-SN 
cells grown for 48 h with 10 µg ml − 1 tet and cDNA was synthesized with MuMLV-RT by using primers shown in the upper panel. Primers S1 and S2 are 
from conserved SINE sequences and would amplify genomic as well as marked SINE1. (a) RT reaction with primer A2 followed by PCR with primers 
S1-A2. The amplicon of 275 bp thus obtained was cloned in pGEMTEasy vector and ten random clones were selected for sequencing. The DNA sequence 
of SINE1 in these clones is represented by bold lines with eight clones having sequence identical to input-tagged EhSINE1 and two clones having three 
and one mismatches, respectively (represented by vertical lines). (b) Same as in (a), with indicated RT–PCR primers to obtain the SINE sequence 3′ of 
the tag. As EhSINEs are polyadenylated at 3′ ends21,22, RT reaction was primed with oligo d(T). (c) Multiple alignment of the five clones of set III and 
the marked EhSINE1 (MS) shows the location of primers for genomic PCR. Primer pairs PRF-A2 and A1-PRR were used with total genomic DNA to check 
if tag-containing set III sequences already existed in the genome before induction of retrotransposition with tet. Primer pair PAF-PAR was derived from 
conserved sequences and served as positive control.ARTICLE

Figure 6 | Polymorphic sites in the EhSINE1 population are distributed in a mosaic pattern. The coordinates of the 63 full-length EhSINE1 copies 
selected for analysis are shown on the left. These copies were selected because they are thought to have retrotransposed most recently12. Sequences of 
the 63 copies were aligned and nucleotide positions varying in at least 12 copies were selected. In all, 16 such positions found are displayed. Blocks of four 
consecutive positions with the same sequence have been given the same colour for clarity. The five identical pairs found are indicated by same shading in 
the left column.ARTICLE
