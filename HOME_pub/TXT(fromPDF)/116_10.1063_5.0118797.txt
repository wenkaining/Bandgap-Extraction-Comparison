ABSTRACT
The main cause of the fragile-to-strong crossover of 3D silica was previously attributed to the presence of a low-energy cutoff in the potential
energy landscape. An important question emerges about the microscopic origin of this crossover and its generalizibility to other glass-formers.
In this work, the fragile-to-strong crossover of a model two-dimensional (2D) glassy system is analyzed via molecular dynamics simulation,
which represents 2D-silica. By separating the sampled defect and defect-free inherent structures, we are able to identify their respective density
of state distributions with respect to energy. A low energy cutoff is found in both distributions. It is shown that the fragile-to-strong crossover
can be quantitatively related to the parameters of the energy landscape, involving, in particular, the low-energy cutoff of the energy distribu-
tion. It is also shown that the low-energy cutoff of the defect-states is determined by the formation energy of a specific defect configuration,
involving two silicon and no oxygen defects. The low-temperature behavior of 2D silica is quantitatively compared with that of 3D silica,
showing surprisingly similar behavior.

I. INTRODUCTION
The origin of the anomalous temperature dependence of viscos-
ity is a matter of debate for glassy systems. In general, the dynamical
behavior of glassy systems can be described either as “strong” or
“fragile,” depending on the nature of the relationship between the
viscosity (η) and temperature (T); i.e., the Angell plot1 [ln(η(T)) vs
β, where β = 1/KBT]. Assuming the validity of the Stokes–Einstein
relation,2 one can represent η(T) ∝1/D(T), where D(T) rep-
resents the diffusivity of the fluid. The strong glasses obey the
Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the diffusion constant,
i.e., D(T) ∝exp(−βV0), where V0 is the average activation energy
of the fluid. In contrast, the dynamics of the fragile glasses are usu-
ally described with the empirical Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT)
equation3–6
D(T) ∝exp(
α
T −T0
),
(1)
where α and T0 are empirical constants. Experimentally, it has
been shown that several compounds undergo a fragile-to-strong
crossover (FSC) at a certain temperature range,7–13 which is usu-
ally close to the glass transition temperature. Interestingly, molecules
with tetrahedral ordering show a general tendency for such behavior
in the bulk state.13–15 The fragile behavior of glasses at high tem-
peraturesi.e., the power-law behavior of the relaxation timecan be
explained with the help of mode-coupling theory.16,17 Upon cooling,
the transition to Arrhenius behavior is often correlated with a sup-
posed liquid–liquid phase transition, which generally occurs in the
super-cooled region.18–23 However, the proper physical mechanism
for FSCat either the bulk or molecular levelis not well understood.
Potential energy landscape (PEL) analysis of the glassy systems
provides a good understanding of the FSC phenomenon at low tem-
peratures. It is known that, below the mode-coupling temperature,
the dynamics and thermodynamics of the system start to corre-
late, and the nature of the dynamical properties strongly reflects

the properties of the PEL. In this region, the nature of the PEL
can be described by the properties of the underlying minima, i.e.,
Inherent States (IS).24–31 At higher temperatures, the fragile behav-
ior can be linked to the multiplicity and the width of the underlying
IS-energy distributions.32,33 With decreasing temperature, the con-
figurational entropy of the system (Sc) decreases, and the widths
of the basins in the PEL landscape become narrower. Following
the Adam–Gibbs theory,34 one can determine the relaxation time
and subsequently the diffusivity as a function of the Sc in the low-
temperature region as D(T) ∝exp(−B/TSc), where B is a constant.
Therefore, if Sc is independent of temperature,35–37 a transition from
fragile to strong behavior can be related to an inflection in Sc. Using
molecular dynamics simulations, Saksaengwijit et al.38 have shown
that in the case of BKS-silica,39 there exists a cutoff in the density
of states (DOS) distribution of IS’s at a certain energy. The presence
of such a cutoff prevents Sc from vanishing at low temperatures and
thus avoids the Kauzmann paradox. However, determination of the
nature of the reduction of Sc at a low temperature is a difficult task
in simulation as it is computationally demanding.40,41 Thus, proper
calculation of the FSC temperature from the IS analysis remains
challenging.
The microscopic origin of FSC varies from system to sys-
tem. Poly-amorphism37 was often suspected to be the driving force
behind the FSC phenomenon. For example, a two-state model was
proposed by Tanaka et al.42–44 to explain the viscosity anomaly
of water. In this model, two different configurations of locally
favored small clusters of water molecules control the bulk prop-
erties of water. The FSC in water can thus be explained by the
population ratio of such clusters, both of which separately fol-
low the Arrhenius type temperature dependence of viscosity. This
model predicts a smooth crossover from the fragile to the strong
regime and was able to predict the crossover temperature, TFSC,
quite well.43,44 In the case of several tetrahedrally ordered halide-
molecules,13 e.g., ZnCl2,12,45 BeF2,10,45 GeSe2,46–48 the reduction
of the Sc near FSC has also been correlated with the changes
in the ordering of the local environment. For these materials, in
both experiment12,45,48 and simulation,49,50 a sharp change has been
observed in the ratio of the local edge-sharing tetrahedral order-
ing to the entropically favored corner-sharing tetrahedral ordering,
with a lowering temperature in the vicinity of FSC. These results
clearly indicate that FSC is linked to the specific microscopic envi-
ronment of the fluid. Recently, a continuum model, in conjugation
to the two-state theory, has been proposed to explain the non-
Arrhenius behavior of the liquids using non-linear Fokker–Plank
equations.51,52
Despite the similarity between the molecular structure (tetrahe-
dral) of water and silica, they exhibit several differences in terms of
cluster formation.53 While the structure of the water-clusters is con-
trolled by the hydrogen-bond network, the silica-clusters are con-
trolled by the flexibility of the bridging-oxygen bonds. As a result,
although water and silica exhibit some dynamical and thermody-
namical similaritye.g., density anomaly, FSC, etc.their microscopic
origin can be somewhat different. Saksaengwijit et al.38 have pos-
tulated that for BKS-silica,39 the FSC can be related to a decrease
in the fraction of coordination defects. As the temperature of the
system is lowered, the fraction of the coordination defects in silica
decreases. Recently, using replica exchange molecular dynamics, Yu
et al.40 have shown that the rate of such a decrease shows a sharp
increase near its fictive temperature. Thus, near the cutoff, one can
postulate that the defect states will completely disappear. This, in
turn, should result in an arrest in the hopping dynamics of silica as
the effective activation energy for the bond-breaking process would
be very large.38,54
In this paper, we study the FSC behavior of a two-dimensional
silica (2D) model system, which represents an allotrope of silica,
namely the two-dimensional silica55 (2D-silica). This material is an
ideal member to study the properties of a natural glass forming sys-
tem with computer simulation since an atomistic scale description of
the real structure is available directly from the experiment. 2D-silica
is grown on Ru56 or Graphene surfaces57 via vapor deposition and in
situ oxidation. The binding of 2D-silica with the underlying surface
is quite weak, which makes it a free-standing material.58 However,
the material is extremely thin, with a height of just approximately
three atoms in the Z-direction.56 Therefore, measuring the high
temperature properties of this material is quite difficult as it would
desorb from the surface during heating. Thus, for this system, the
FSC behavior is expected to be inaccessible via experiments. There-
fore, computer simulations play an important role in elucidating the
properties of this system close to the FSC.
The objective of this paper is to show that the PEL description
of the dynamical behavior works well for the description of FSC in
the 2D-silica model. Similar to the BKS-silica model, we aim to cor-
relate the presence of a cutoff in the PEL with the FSC phenomenon
in 2D-silica. We provide further insight into the microscopic envi-
ronment of 2D-silica near the FSC in terms of the coordination
defects. The paper is organized as follows: We start with a short
account of the methods in Sec. II and analyze the density of states
(DOS) distributions. In Sec. III, we study the changes in the PEL
influenced by the coordination defects and explicitly show that the
FSC is related to the cutoff in the PEL. Afterward, we show in Sec. IV
that a specific local arrangement of the particles is present at the low
energy limit, which is independent of the system size, thus yielding
insight into the structural and energetic properties of the defects. We
finish with a conclusion and an outlook.
II. METHODS
A. Simulation
In our previous studies,59–61 we have used a Yukawa type force-
field to describe the structural and thermodynamical properties of
2D-silica in close similarity with the experimental results, which
reads
Vij(rij) =
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
(σij
rij
)
12
+ (qij
rij
) exp(−κrij)
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
.

For details of the simulation parameters, we refer to Ref. 59.
With an 80 particle system in a square box of side length 19.67 Å,
we performed a molecular dynamics simulation under NVT con-
ditions for a wide range of temperatures using the Nosé–Hoover
chains thermostat,62,63 and an elementary timestep of 0.01. We sam-
ple the inherent structures and their energies (EIS) by quenching the
trajectory with a frequency of 100 steps. Except for the mean square
displacement (MSD) calculations, we use the minimized structures
for analysis throughout the paper.

B. Defects
In our analysis, we separate the IS’s based on the coordination
defects. We denote an IS as a defect-free state (abbreviation: df), if
all Si particles have three O particles and all O particles have two
Si particles within an empirical cutoff distance of 2.0 Å. Otherwise,
the IS is termed a defect-state (abbreviation: d). The choice of this
cutoff is based on the gSi–O(r) analysis,59 which showed a sharp peak
around 1.5–1.6 Å in the low energy regime. Since we are interested in
the structural features of the model at low temperatures, the choice
of the distance cutoff is sufficient to identify any coordination defects
in the structure.
C. Reweighting
With the sampled IS structures at one given temperature, one
can calculate the DOS [G(EIS)] at different energies. This calcula-
tion is performed by binning the distribution of inherent structures
P(EIS, T) and reweighting the resulting energy distribution with an
inverse Boltzmann factor, i.e.,
G(E IS) ∝P(E IS, T)eβE IS.
(3)
Naturally, one unknown energy-independent proportionality
constant remains. Similarly, one can define Gd(EIS) and Gdf(EIS)
as the DOS of the defect-states and defect-free states, respectively.
We note that this relation, i.e., the estimation of a temperature-
independent DOS, is valid as long as anharmonic effects in the
vibrations within an IS are not too strong.31,64 Strictly speaking, the
DOS should be rather interpreted as an effective DOS because each
state is also weighted by the harmonic partition function, i.e., by the
inverse square root of the frequency.31 It is known that the DOS
distribution of a binary Lennard-Jones liquid or BKS-silica has a
Gaussian shape over a large energy range.64–66
To determine G(EIS) over a broad energy range, based on
the Boltzmann distributions from different temperatures, one could
try to overlap the different G(EIS)-curves, obtained from different
temperatures. A procedure to obtain the DOS in a statistically opti-
mized way is the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM).67
To obtain the DOS G(EIS), we use the algorithm developed by
Gallicchio et al.,68 which reads for the present application
G(E IS) =
∑iN(E IS, Ti)
∑iNi(Ti)fi(Ti)ci(E IS, Ti).
(4)
Here, N(EIS, Ti) is the total counts of the states at energy bin
EIS at temperature Ti and N(Ti) = ∑jN(Ej
IS, Ti). ci(EIS, Ti) is called
a component of the biasing matrix, which is calculated as
ci(E IS, Ti) = exp[−βiE IS].
From there, one can optimize the normalization factor
fi(Ti) as
f −1
i
(Ti) = ∑
j
ci(Ej
IS, Ti)G(Ej
IS, Ti).
We iteratively optimize the normalization factor fi(Ti) until
convergence is reached and the DOS can be read off. Note that the
resulting DOS is defined except for one proportionality constant.
In analogy, this procedure can be applied as well for the deter-
mination of Gd(EIS) and Gdf(EIS). However, due to the unknown
proportionality constants, we would not be able to determine, e.g.,
the fraction of defect-free states qdf(EIS) at a given energy EIS. Nat-
urally, from equilibrium simulations at a given temperature Ti one
can directly read of this fraction qi
df(E IS, Ti). Since this fraction is an
equilibrium property, in the limit of infinite sampling, it would not
depend on temperature. In the spirit of WHAM, we join the infor-
mation from the simulations at the different temperatures for the
estimation of qdf(EIS) via
qdf(E IS) = ∑iN(E IS, Ti)qi
df(E IS, Ti)
∑iN(E IS, Ti)
.
(5)
In practice, we first determine G(EIS) (via WHAM) and
qdf(EIS) as described above and then estimate the DOS for the
defect-free states and defect-states, respectively, via
Gdf(E IS) = G(E IS)qdf(E IS),
Gd(E IS) = G(E IS)(1 −qdf(E IS)).

III. PEL PROPERTIES AND THEIR RELATION
TO THE DIFFUSIVITY
In this section, we investigate the DOS distributions of defect
and defect-free states with energy using the WHAM optimized
energy distributions in Sec. II C. All the important parameters, to
be discussed below, are summarized in Table I.
A. Density of states
In Fig. 1(a), we show the Boltzmann distribution pd(EIS, T) of
defect-states for a large range of temperatures. Whereas for the high-
est temperature (curve at the right end), the distribution is basically
Gaussian, one observes for lower temperatures deviations from the
Gaussian shape in the low-energy range and the presence of a cutoff-
energy of E cutoff
d
= −26.93. This value does not seem to depend on
temperature.
In the next step, we reconstructed the underlying DOS via sim-
ple reweighting [see Fig. 1(b)]. Indeed, we find that over a large range
of energies, DOS curves overlap with each other, which confirms that

is also shown, and its values are related to the right Y-axis. For a complete list of different parameters, see Table I.
the simulations at the lowest temperatures have been done at equi-
librium. Similar observations can be made for the total DOS and the
defect-free DOS as well (see the supplementary material, Fig. SM.1).
In the high energy range, the DOS seems to depend on tempera-
ture. As mentioned above, this indicates the presence of significant
anharmonic effects at high temperatures. For a large range of ener-
gies, the distribution follows a Gaussian shape. Importantly, in the
low-energy range, the DOS of defect states decays much faster than
a Gaussian distribution, reflecting the presence of the cutoff-energy.
The analogous results for the defect-free states are shown in Fig. 1(c)
[see also supplementary material Fig. SM.1(a), for DOS of all-states].
Finally, in Fig. 1(d), we show the results of the WHAM analysis,
i.e., the DOS G(EIS), G d( IS), Gdf(EIS), as well as the fraction of
defect-free states qdf(EIS). Note that the relevant energy regime,
shown in this figure, only covers the regime where the determina-
tion of the DOS is not hampered by anharmonic effects. Moreover,
for the defect-free states, we find a low-energy cutoff. The estimated
cutoff energy of the defect-free states, E cutoff
df
≈−27.04 is significantly
lower than E cutoff
d
, namely ΔE cutoff = E cutoff

−E cutoff
df
∼0.11. As a con-
sequence, the overall DOS G(EIS) also displays the same cutoff
as Gd(EIS). Such a cutoff-energy was also observed in the case of
BKS-silica.38
Interestingly, ΔEcutoff hardly changes when increasing the sys-
tem size from 80 to 200 particles [ΔEcutoff(N = 200) ∼0.12 as can
be derived from the data in the supplementary material Fig. SM.2].
This result suggests that the minimal number of particles, required

to create a defect state, is independent of size. Later, we will show
that the structure of the defect-states at the cutoff energy involves a
well-defined local environment other than the usual trigonal geome-
try, so that the energy of 0.11 can be interpreted as a minimum defect
formation energy. Furthermore, E cutoff
df
/N hardly varies with system
size. Thus, the energy of the lowest energy state, which is a defect-
free state, is an extensive property. Due to the local character of the
formation of a defect, it is expected that ΔEcutoff is not extensive. This
is indeed clearly seen in the supplementary material, Fig. SM.2.
Finally, we discuss the properties of the fraction of defect-free
states qdf(EIS). It has an asymmetric behavior: whereas at low ener-
gies one observes a sharp cutoff, below which only defect-free states
are available, at high temperatures there is a more gradual approach
toward the limit where only defect-states are present. Indeed, as seen
from the supplementary material (Fig. SM.1), there is no indica-
tion of a strict cutoff-energy at high energies, although defect-free
states become exponentially rare. Nevertheless, there is a fast tran-
sition from the energy regime governed by defect-free states to
the regime governed by defect-states. In fact, it takes an energy
variation of less than 0.06 to change between qdf(EIS) = 0.2 and
qdf(EIS) = 0.8. The crossover energy, E cross
0
, where qdf(EIS) = 0.5, i.e.,
where the number of defect-free states and defect-states is identi-
cal, turns out to be −26.86. In terms of per-particle energies, the
value of E cross
0
gets lower for a larger system size, see the supple-
mentary material (Fig. SM.2). This is because the probability of
finding defect-free states decreases exponentially with increasing
system size.59 This is a consequence of the fact that a large system
can be decomposed into approximately independent smaller subsys-
tems. Then it becomes very unlikely that the total system contains
no defects because this requires that every subsystem be defect-
free. This underlines the importance of studying a smaller system
size, where the statistical characterization of defect-free states is far
easier.
B. Fragile to strong crossover
Next, we explore a possible relationship between the kinet-
ics and the thermodynamics of the system. In Fig. 2(a), we show
the temperature-dependent diffusion constant. One clearly finds a
transition from non-Arrhenius to simple Arrhenius behavior,
D(T) = D0 exp[−V0β],
(7)
i.e., a transition from fragile to strong behavior. We have added fits
with the VFT equation in the high-temperature and an Arrhenius fit
in the low-temperature regime. Starting from the VFT fit, the first
significant deviation is seen for β ≈80.
To relate the kinetics to the thermodynamics of the system, we
provide the average IS energy (E av
IS(T) in Fig. 2(b). Again, two tem-
perature regimes can be observed. Both have a simple interpretation.
If the DOS is governed by a Gaussian distribution with variance s2,
one expects a linear behavior
E av
IS(T) = Emax
IS −βs2.
(8)
Indeed, this is seen in the high-temperature regime in Fig. 2(b). The
negative slope of 0.013 is very close to the result of the Gaussian fit
(s2 = 0.014), reported in Table I. Naturally, in the low-temperature
regime, the average energy starts to approach the cutoff energy. Most
importantly, the impact of the cutoff energy again starts to be vis-
ible around β ≈80, which is exactly the same temperature regime
as observed for the FSC. This strongly suggests a direct causal rela-
tionship between the kinetics and the thermodynamics. We mention
in passing that the crossover temperature can be estimated from
FIG. 2. (a) Dependence of ln(1/D) on inverse temperature. The data in the fragile-regime (region marked in red) are fitted with the VFT equation [Eq. (1)] and data in the
strong-regime (region marked in gray) are fitted with an Arrhenius equation [Eq. (7)]. The values of α and T0 are ≈0.014 and 0.011, respectively. The value of V0 is ≈0.26.
Data inside the mixed regime are not fitted using any equations, but the approximations from both the fragile and strong regimes are extrapolated to measure βFSC. (b)
Dependence of the average IS energy on the inverse temperature. A linear fit is performed between 62.5 ≤β ≤77 with slope ∼−0.013. The cutoff energy for the total
system (same as for the defect-free states, E cut
df ) and defect states (E cut
d ) are also shown as horizontal lines.

IS(T) ≈E cutoff

+ s. The second summand expresses
the fact that the energy-cutoff starts to matter as soon as the cut-
off is within a standard deviation of the average energy (in a
Gaussian approximation). Using the values s = 0.12, Emax
IS
= −25.77
(see the supplementary material, Fig. SM.1), and E cutoff
df
= −27.04,
one obtains β = 79.8, which is basically identical to the estimated
crossover temperature of β ≈80.
C. Comparison with bulk silica
Previously, FSC has also been observed for 3D bulk silica
simulated with the standard BKS forcefield38and related to the prop-
erties of the energy landscape. In this way, the causality could be
directly proven.54 Here, we perform a quantitative comparison of
the FSC in order to identify similarities and differences between
2D silica and 3D silica. However, before starting, we estimate the
crossover temperature for 3D (s = 3.5 eV, Emax
IS
= −1867 eV, and
E cutoff
df
= −1910.7 eV) as T = 0.30 eV ≈3500 K, which agrees very well
with the emergence of the crossover behavior of the diffusivity and
the average energy, reported in Ref. 38.
(i)
System size: For the estimation of the diffusivity, one can
define an energy-dependent activation energy Eeff(EIS),54
which for 3D silica can be written to a very good approxima-
tion as (for E IS ≥E cutoff
df
)
E eff(E IS) ≈λ(E cutoff
df
−E IS) + V0(E cutoff
df
).
(9)
More generally, the possibility to formulate a relation between
activation energy and IS energy (strictly speaking, metabasin
energy, which, however, for the typically visited IS at low tem-
peratures is basically identical) shows the generally strong
connection between the dynamic properties and the nature
of the PEL for glass-forming systems.29,64,69,70 The value λ ≤1
has a simple interpretation: λ × N is the size of the hypothet-
ical elementary subsystem to which relaxation processes are
basically confined. Indeed, it has been shown31 that by dou-
bling the system size, the value of λ decreases by a factor of 2.
From the data in Ref. 54, one can estimate λ ≈0.6. Thus, for
the system size of N = 99, used for the simulation of bulk sil-
ica, an elementary system comprises ∼60 particles.
In the present case, we have no direct information for the esti-
mation of λ. However, we can formulate an upper bound. Nat-
urally, for the highest temperature where anharmonic effects
do not matter (β ≈60) one still has activated behavior, i.e.,
E eff(E av
IS(β = 60)) ≳0. This implies [using V0(E cutoff
df
) = 0.26,
see Fig. 2(a), and E av
IS(β = 60) = −26.69] that λ ≤0.74. Thus,
the hypothetical elementary subsystem has a size of less than
0.74 × 80 ≈60 particles.
(ii)
PEL landscape: A natural dimensionless number, characteriz-
ing the shape of the DOS, is given by [(Emax
IS −E cutoff
df
)]/s. It
expresses the impact of the cutoff energy relative to the over-
all shape of the Gaussian. In the present case, we have (−25.77
+ 27.04)/0.12 = 10.6. Reading off the corresponding values for
bulk silica from Ref. 38, we obtain (−1867 + 1910.7 eV)/3.5 eV
= 12.5. However, for a direct comparison, we need to take into
account that these ratios depend on system size. Whereas the
energies in the numerator scale with the system size, the stan-
dard deviation in the denominator scales with the square root
of the system size. For a fair comparison, the values should be
evaluated for the respective elementary system sizes. However,
with the present data, it cannot be excluded that the elemen-
tary system sizes are comparable, the same holds for the shape
of the DOS.
(iii)
Defect-states vs defect-free states: One may ask for the energy
to generate defects. In the present case, it is given by
ΔEcutoff ≈0.11. To obtain an appropriate dimensionless num-
ber, we may relate this value to the crossover temperature,
yielding (0.11/(1/80)) ≈8.8. Interestingly, for bulk silica,
there exist defect-states very close to the cutoff-energy of
defect-free states. From the data in Ref. 38, one may esti-
mate ΔE cutoff
3 D
≈1.0 eV. This yields a ratio of (1/0.3 eV)
= 3.3, which is significantly smaller than 8.8. One may
speculate that in 3D there exist more degrees of freedom
so that defects with (relatively) lower energy costs can be
generated.
(iv)
Activation energy: We represent activation energy as a ratio
of the low-temperature activation energy to the crossover
temperature, which makes it a dimensionless number and
independent of the system size. Whereas for the 2D system, we
have a ratio of (0.26/(1/80)) ≈21, the corresponding ratio for
the 3D system reads (data taken from Ref. 38) (4.84/0.30 eV)
≈16. Thus, the effective barriers for relaxation processes agree
relatively well. The remaining differences may be related to
a similar argument as in (iii) that in 3D there are more
degrees of freedom, which allows the system to explore more
energy-efficient paths.
IV. STRUCTURAL ASPECTS
At the low-temperature limit, where the system mainly resides
close to the low-energy cutoff of defect-free states, the residual tran-
sitions between different defect-free states naturally involve the tran-
sient population defect states. This is supported by the observation
that the low-temperature activation energy of 0.26 is significantly
larger than the difference in the cutoff energies of the states with
and without defects. Furthermore, the deviations from the linear
energy dependence vs inverse temperature, expected for a Gaussian
glass-former, start around the cutoff energy of defect states. For this
purpose, we continue with the discussion of the structural prop-
erties of defect states, in particular those close to their low-energy
cutoff.
A. Ring statistics
We start by studying the statistics of ring sizes as a function
of energy. We found in Fig. 3(a) that with increasing temperature,
the probability of finding 5, 6, and 7 rings decreases, whereas for
all other rings it increases. It is an expected behavior, since the
large (>ringsize 7) and small (<ringsize 5) rings are quite strained
and hence have higher energies.60,61 In Fig. 3(b), we show the
standard deviation of the ring distribution. As expected in ther-
modynamic equilibrium, at a given energy, the standard deviation
does not depend on temperature within statistical uncertainties.
One observes a different dependence on energy when crossing the
crossover energy E cross
0
.

B. Energy-dependent defect properties
To examine the properties of the defect-states in the low-energy
limit, we sort the defect-states according to the number of defect-Si
particles, denoted dSi. Here, we do not distinguish whether a defect-
Si particle has more or less than three O neighbors. The probabilities
of finding a specific number of defect-Si particles at a given energy
are shown in Fig. 4(a). Clearly, the silicon defect states exactly disap-
pear at E cutoff
d
. Again, the data are obtained from averaging over all
temperatures, in analogy to Eq. (5). Actually, the average number of
defect-Si particles linearly increases with energy above E cutoff
d
(see the
supplementary material, Fig. SM.3). Similar to the observation of Yu
et al.40 in BKS-silica, we find that the slope of the number of defect
particles vs energy decreases with increasing energy. After exclud-
ing dSi = 0 states, the appropriately renormalized data are shown in
Fig. 5(a). We find that very close to E cutoff
d
, all defect-states have two
silicon defects, i.e., dSi = 2. In particular, there are no defect states
with just one silicon defect. They only start to appear at slightly
higher energies. This is also reflected in the anomalous behavior of
the average number of defects (excluding dSi = 0 states), shown in
the supplementary material, Fig. SM.3.

c(EIS, CSi–O) to find a specific combination of the co-ordinations of the defect-Si particles for dSi = 2 states at energy EIS, normalized by the total number of dSi = 2 states.
1–4 defects are ignored in this plot due to their very small probability.
Analogously, we study the properties of oxygen defects. In
Fig. 4(b), the probabilities of finding a specific number of defect-O
particles are shown. We find that already above E cutoff
d
no oxy-
gen defects are present. Thus, there exists an energy range where
two silicon defects are present but no oxygen defect (see below
for a closer characterization of that state). For states slightly above
E cutoff
d
, in average two defect-Si but no defect-O particles are
present.
The structures of the dSi = 2 defect states are further analyzed
by counting different Si–O co-ordinations (CSi–O) of the partic-
ipating defect-Si particles (i, j), such as Ci
Si−O = 1 and Cj
Si−O = 4
(abbreviation: 1-4 defect); (Ci
Si−O = 2) and Cj
Si−O = 2 (abbreviation:
2-2 defect); Ci
Si−O = 2 and Cj
Si−O = 4 (abbreviation: 2-4 defect). As
shown in Fig. 5(b), near E cutoff
d
only 2-4 defect states are observed.
Performing a similar analysis for dSi = 1 states, we find that only
CSi–O = 2 co-ordination is present for the single defect-Si particle
at all energies. We find that such a Si–O co-ordination for dSi = 1
states is not possible with dO = 0 but with dO = 1, as by definition,
the co-ordination numbers of the Si and O particles are dependent
on each other. Performing a similar co-ordination number analysis
to only dO = 1 states, we find that the corresponding CO–Si is strictly
1 within our simulation set up.
Next, we analyze the spatial correlations between the defect-Si
particles in each frame by calculating the average distance between
them in dependence of energy, rdefect(EIS). The results are shown in
Fig. 6. We find that the minimum value is ⟨r defect(E IS)⟩∼3 Å, which
is also the average distance between two Si particles in a defect-free
state.59 The average distance between the defect particles increases
with energy and becomes constant after a certain energy range, sug-
gesting a breakdown of any spatial correlations among defect-Si
particles. The limiting value of the average distance can be calculated
by evaluating the integral,

which for the 80 particle system corresponds to ∼7.55.
C. Microscopic realizations
These results suggest that there exists a locally well-defined
defect structure for the defect-states close to E cutoff
d
. This structure
involves no defect-O particles but two close-by defect-Si parti-
cles within a distance of ∼3 Å. The two defect-Si particles have a
coordination number of 2 and 4, respectively, yielding the average
FIG. 6. Average distance between two defect-Si particles. The limit of a random
distribution is shown at ⟨r defect(E IS)⟩∼7.55.

(b) is marked with a red ellipse.
co-ordination numbers ⟨CSi–O⟩= 3, ⟨CO–Si⟩= 2 for the total system
at E cutoff
d
.
A typical structure of the dSi = 2 states close to the E cutoff
d
is
shown in Fig. 7(a). Starting from a defect-free structure, one can gen-
erate this defect-structure by transferring one O particle from one Si
particle to an adjacent Si particle. With increasing energy, more O
particles are transferred further along the network, and the aver-
age distance between defect-Si particles (⟨r defect⟩) increases from
3 Å. This result has a trivial size dependence, as the oxygen trans-
fer can happen simultaneously at larger distances. As a result, the
value of ⟨r defect⟩in Fig. 6 may increase at low energies for large sys-
tems. This again underlines the need to study small systems to clearly
elucidate the energy-dependent structural properties at low energies.
Furthermore, it explains our observation that the difference between
the two cutoff energies, ΔEcutoff, is practically independent of system
size.
A typical state with dSi = 1 is displayed in Fig. 7(b). These struc-
tures involve a dangling O particle with coordination number 1. A
comparison of the states with dSi = 2 and dSi = 1 suggests that, from
an energetic point of view, a state with dSi = 2 is closer to the defect-
free states than a state with dSi = 1 and thus has the chance to display
a lower energy.
The result shows that the average number of defect particles
and average co-ordination number of the system may not have a lin-
ear relationship with energy, at least near E cutoff
d
. Indeed, as shown in
the supplementary material Fig. SM.4(a), the average co-ordination
number of defect-Si states (excluding dSi = 0 states) states shows a
minimum, roughly around the same location where dSi = 1 states are
most populated. This effect can be attributed to the lower ⟨CSi–O⟩
value of dSi = 1 state as compared to dSi = 2 states. Interestingly, we
find that for defect-O states (excluding dO = 0 states), the average co-
ordination number is constant to 1 throughout the relevant energy
range within our simulation set up. The relatively late appearance
of dO = 2, 3 states in the energy spectrum might be a reason for this
observation.
V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In this work, we have shown that the phenomenon of FSC in
a 2D-silica model can be directly related to the properties of the
PEL. We find that both the defect and defect-free states have a low
energy cutoff. The energy difference between these energies does
not depend on system size, which is a first hint that the low-energy
defect-states are fully local. Similar to the case of BKS-silica, we find
that at the temperature where the system senses the presence of the
final low-energy cutoff, the fragile to strong crossover (FSC) in the
kinetics is observed. The results suggest that the emergence of the
low-energy cutoff of Gdf(EIS) [or G(EIS)] is the major cause of the
FSC.
Structurally, the properties of the low-energy defect states have
been clearly characterized. One can see that the defect ground-state
is a spatially coupled pair of defect-Si particles, which does not
involve any dangling bond, in contrast to a structure with just a sin-
gle defect-Si particle. Thus, the absence of a dangling bond renders
the double defect structure energetically more favorable.
The qualitative similarity of the observed FSC phenomenon
between 2D and 3D silica supports the notion that the FSC may
be a generic phenomenon observed for network-forming systems.
Furthermore, it enables a quantitative comparison, revealing the
impact of dimension. A major difference between both systems
is seen in the normalized difference of the cutoff energies of the
defect and defect-free states. Another difference we have observed
is that the low-temperature activation energy for the 2D system is
∼30% higher than for the 3D system. Both effects may be related
to the difficulty in the 2D system of finding reaction coordinates
with low energy barriers. Furthermore, we would like to stress that

the 2D activation energy is more than twice as high as the energy
difference between the overall ground-state and the ground-state
defect structure (0.26 vs 0.11). This reflects the complexity that is
involved in the transition between two defect-free states, dominat-
ing at low temperatures, as well as the additional impact of activation
barriers.
We would like to remark that here we observe a variety of dif-
ferent defect states (Fig. 4) when increasing the energy somewhat
above their cutoff energy. Furthermore, we found that for higher
energies, the density of states behaves like a Gaussian glass-forming
system, as also supported by the linear dependence of E av
IS on β in
Fig. 2(b). A well-defined second Arrhenius-regime at higher temper-
atures is absent as well. Hence, a direct application of the two-state
model42–44 does not seem to be possible.
The present analysis has again shown that the choice of small
system sizes is essential to learn about specific PEL-related proper-
ties. Otherwise, the low-energy properties would be smeared out and
it would be difficult to identify the microscopic origin of the FSC
beyond the mere identification of similar crossover temperatures in
the thermodynamic and kinetic properties.
It will be interesting to use a three-body force-field (such
as the Stillinger-Weber potential71) in addition to the two-body
Yukawa force-field and analyze how the new 2D-silica model
changes its properties near the FSC-regime. In the present 2D-
silica model, it is possible to unambiguously separate defect and
defect-free states based on a single cutoff radius at all tempera-
tures. It remains to be seen if similar analysis can be performed
on other network-forming materials that show FSC as well, such as
water.
