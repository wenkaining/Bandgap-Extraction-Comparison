Recent pump-probe experiments performed on graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field have revealed
carrier relaxation times ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds depending on the quality of the sample.
To explain this surprising behavior, we propose a novel symmetry-breaking defect-assisted relaxation
channel. This enables scattering of electrons with single out-of-plane phonons, which drastically accelerate
the carrier scattering time in low-quality samples. The gained insights provide a strategy for tuning the
carrier relaxation time in graphene and related materials by orders of magnitude.

In
graphene,
the
impact
of
momentum-conserving
acoustic phonon processes on relaxation of nonequilibrium
electronic excitations is limited by the low sound velocity,
restricting the maximum energy transfer per scattering event
[1]. Conversely, defect-assisted electron-phonon scattering
events, so called supercollisions, can have a profound impact
on the relaxation time by removing the in-plane momentum
conservation, since the excess momentum can be absorbed by
defects[1–7].Forgrapheneina magneticfield,thesituationis
drastically changed since the in-plane translation symmetry is
broken with the consequence that the electron momentum
is no longer a conserved quantity, suggesting that super-
collisions are not important in Landau-quantized graphene.
In light of this, the experimental results for electron
relaxation times between graphene Landau levels in this
Letter are very surprising, since they clearly show a strong
dependence of the relaxation time on the quality of the
sample. To explain these findings, we propose a novel
mechanism for defect-assisted electron-phonon scattering
breaking the mirror symmetry of the graphene plane. By
defect we refer to local perturbations introducing additional
scattering channels and breaking the mirror symmetry. Such
defects could, e.g., be local electric field gradients, intersti-
tials, or bucklings of the graphene plane induced by a
substrate roughness or by vacancies [8,9]. In general, the
symmetry with respect to a mirror plane lying in the graphene
plane prevents the linear coupling of charge carriers and out-
of-plane phonons (also known as flexural phonons) in a
perfect sample [10,11]. The removal of the mirror symmetry
by defects turns out to be crucial in Landau-quantized
graphene, where carrier-phonon scattering is governed by
resonances between inter-Landau level transitions and cor-
responding phonon energies [12,13]. While the in-plane
optical phonon energies of graphene range from 150 to
200 meV, the out-of-plane phonon at the Γ point (the
ΓZO mode)—activated by defect-electron interaction—has
an energy of 100 meV [14–16]. For a sufficiently large
Landau level (LL) broadening, supercollisions with ΓZO
phonons allow transitions between the three energetically
lowest levels LL1 and LL0 at reasonable magnetic fields.
The sketchesinFig.1 comparethe ordinarycarrier-phonon
scattering with the defect-assisted carrier-phonon scattering
in two samples with different qualities, where the quality is
defined by the concentration of defects breaking the mirror
symmetry of the graphene plane. The investigated situation is
very similar in both cases: The system is excited using σ−-
polarized radiation that is in resonance with the transition
LL0 →LLþ1, and it develops back to equilibrium via the
emission of phonons. While ordinary carrier-phonon scatter-
ing (LO=TO) is possible in the high and in the low quality
sample, the relaxation in the low quality sample is governed
by supercollisions allowing the emission of out-of-plane
phonons (ΓZO). The latter phonons have a smaller energy
that approximately fits the inter-LL distance of the experi-
ments discussed below. Therefore the relaxation occurs on a
picosecond time scale (τ ∼10 ps) as opposed to a nanosec-
ond time scale (τ ∼1 ns) in the case of a high quality sample.
We present a theoretical study supported by experimental
observations. Degenerate pump-probe experiments were
carried out on two different multilayer epitaxial graphene
samples. To this end, midinfrared radiation from a free-
electron laser (photon energy 75 meV, pulse duration
2.7 ps, pump fluence 0.1 μJ=cm2) of σ−polarization
was employed for both pumping and probing. The samples
were kept at 10 K in a magnetic field of 4.2 T perpendicular

probe beam were resonant with the LL0 →LLþ1 transition
in the samples. A mercury-cadmium-telluride detector
cooled by liquid nitrogen was used for low-noise detection.
The two multilayer epitaxial graphene samples were grown
by the same technique, namely, thermal decomposition of
the C face of semi-insulating 4H-SiC by the confinement
controlled sublimation (CCS) method [17], however under
slightly different growth conditions. One sample, in the
following named “low quality sample,” has a low structural
quality compared to standard CCS grown epitaxial multi-
layer graphene. The other one, in the following named
“high quality sample” features an extraordinary structural
quality with no D peak in the Raman spectrum [18]. Details
on the growth, characterization by Raman spectroscopy and
doping of the sample, further pump probe data with and
without a magnetic field, details of the theory, and a
discussion of the phonon spectrum in multilayer graphene
can be found in the Supplemental Material [19].
The applied many-particle theory is based on an expansion
of the graphene Bloch equations [35–37] by out-of-plane
symmetry-breaking electron-defect interactions. It reprodu-
ces well the surprising experimental behavior, where decay
times in two samples differ by more than 2 orders of
magnitude, cf. Fig. 2. For the theoretical modeling a pump
fluence of ϵpf ¼ 1 × 10−2 μJ=cm, and an defect-assisted
level broadening of Γde ¼ 0.1 meV (Γde ¼ 10 meV) is used
for the high quality sample (low quality sample). In accor-
dance with Ref. [38], the doping is set to μ ¼ 10 meV in the
high quality case, while a value of μ ¼ 28 meV is used in
the low quality case as indicated by Ref. [39]. Before the
relaxation processes dominate, i.e., during the excitation
pulse, peaks in the transmission featuring very fast decay
times occur. They result from the optical excitation as well as
Auger scattering. Since those have already been discussed in
Ref. [39], we focus on the slower relaxation in this work.
While the high quality sample exhibits a very slow relaxation
time of about τ ∼1 ns, the relaxation is much faster in the
case of the low quality sample reaching times in the range
of τ ∼10 ps.
Theexplanationforthestrongdependenceoftherelaxation
time on the sample quality is twofold: First, as was already
mentioned above, the carrier-phonon relaxation rate in
Landau-quantized graphene is determined by a resonance
condition of phonon energy and the energy of the inter-LL
transition. If both energies coincide for a specific inter-LL
transition, carrier-phonon scattering is efficient between the
two involved LLs. Second, the exact resonance condition is
weakened by a finite broadening that is given by the
dephasing of Landau transitions which also determines the
LL broadening [40]. Therefore, off-resonant scattering is
possible and its efficiency increases with the broadening of
the Landau levels. Consequently, the relaxation is faster in
low quality samples where the Landau level broadening is
larger.Theresonanceconditionisdeterminedbythemagnetic
field, responsible for the formation of Landau states. For the
LL transition in a range of 100 meV, investigated here, only
flexural phonons (ΓZO) provide a fitting energy channel.
However, the corresponding electron-phonon scattering is
symmetry forbidden in pure graphene [10]. Here, we propose
that this relaxation channel is activated in low quality samples
of Landau-quantized graphene by enabling carrier-flexural
phonon (ΓZO) scattering due to defect-assisted electron-
phonon scattering. Only if both factors (a sufficient LL-
broadening and the activation of flexural phonons) are taken
into account, the experimentally observed dependence of the
relaxation time on the quality of the sample can be explained.

ing due to supercollisions. Therefore, the total dephasing is

evaluation of the Bloch equations [Eqs. (4) and (5)] [47].
Before we examine the numerical results in more detail,
we investigate how the scattering rates scale with the

de=Γi;j. Moreover, in this off-resonant regime, the
self-consistently determined dephasing Γi;f is generally of
the same order of magnitude as the defect-induced dephas-
ing Γde
i;f, which yields an effective linear scaling of Wi;f
with Γde
i;f. Consequently, to approximate the scattering rate
WLLþ1→LL0 for supercollisions as well as the other relevant
electron-phonon scattering channels, we set Γi;f →Γde
i;f.
The result is shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrates that normal
electron-phonon scattering is suppressed mainly due to the
high optical phonon energies, and likewise the smaller
energy of the ΓZO-mode explains its importance for the
relaxation in Landau-quantized graphene. In the regime of
well-separated Landau levels, on the other hand, the energy
of acoustic phonons is too small to have an impact on the
carrier dynamics, cf. Ref [37]. Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows
that, in the high quality sample, the supercollisions are
strongly suppressed in the relevant (off-resonant) energy
range, cf. inset of Fig. 3(a), since the off resonance enters
not only through the Lorentzian broadening in Eq. (3) (like
in the case of ordinary electron-phonon scattering) but also
through the energy differences in the supercollision matrix
element [Eq. (2)]. In the low quality sample, on the other
hand, the total dephasing is so large that the relevant energy
lies within the broadened resonance peak of the super-
collisions [purple line in Fig. 3(b)], which is thus the
dominant relaxation channel in this case. Therefore, the
sample quality determining the total dephasing (via Γde
i;f),
critically influences the relaxation. This is the key to
understanding the drastic difference in the relaxation times
of the two experimentally investigated graphene samples,
cf. Fig. 2. Note that the peak heights in Fig. 3 are not to be
trusted, since the scattering rates shown in Fig. 3 are only
valid in the off-resonant regime (Γi;f ≪ΔE).
The dependence of the relaxation time on the defect-
induced dephasing, which is a measure for the sample
quality, is shown in Fig. 4(a) for different values of the
doping. It shows a very slow relaxation for samples with
zero disorder τ ∼10 ns which becomes about 3 orders of
magnitude faster as the disorder concentration is increased.
The very strong decrease of τ for vanishing defect-induced
dephasings Γde < 0.1 meV occurs due to the fact, that in
this case the defect-induced dephasing is no longer the
dominant contribution to the total dephasing Γ. Instead, in
the regime Γde ≪Γ, the total dephasing is essentially
determined by electron-electron scattering that does not
change the occupations—known as pure dephasing—but
constitutes a scattering channel which competes with
relaxation channels (like electron-phonon scattering and
supercollisions). Furthermore, we observe that the relaxa-
tion time depends on the doping of the sample, since
this determines the initial occupations and therewith the
Pauli blocking, cf., the occupations in Eq. (4). Considering
solely the transition LLþ1 →LL0, Eq. (4) reads _ρþ1 ¼
−Wþ1→0ρþ1ð1 −ρ0Þ, which—assuming a constant ρ0—
yields an exponential decay ρþ1 ¼ expð−t=τÞ with the
relaxation time τ ¼ 1=½Wþ1→0ð1 −ρ0Þ. This illustrates
that τ can become very large for a nearly completely filled
LL0. To understand the minimal change of the relaxation
time for dopings below ∼28 meV and the marked change
for higher dopings, we take a look at the initial value of
the occupation ρ0 in dependence of the doping of the
sample, cf., black line in Fig. 4(b), resulting from a Fermi
distribution for an effective doping (purple line). The
effective doping μeffective for a magnetic field of B ¼
4.2 T is calculated from the doping in the absence of a
field μreal using the criterion that the carrier density does
not change when the magnetic field is switched on,
cf. Ref. [39]. The observation that LL0 is far from being
completely filled for low dopings, while it is almost filled
for dopings higher than μreal ∼40 meV, explains the
doping dependence of the relaxation time.
Finally, we compare the obtained results to magnetotran-
sport experiments from Refs. [48,49], where the temperature
dependence of energy loss rates in a variety of Landau-
quantized graphene samples was measured. The results are in
agreement with ordinary supercollisions involving acoustic

show thatin this energyrangedefect-assisted electron-ΓZO-phonon

while it is negligible in the high quality sample.

067405-4phonons, and the high-field energy loss rates are only about
40% smaller in comparison to the zero-field case. This seems
to contradict our results but in fact it is consistent with
our interpretation. The samples used in the aforementioned
magnetotransport experiments are single layer graphene
samples with a finite doping, where the Fermi energy lies
at the 8th Landau level or higher. Therefore, according to the
findings of Ref. [50], the experiments are performed in a
regime where the Landau levels are not well separated, i.e.,
adjacentLandaulevelsoverlap.Consequently,scatteringwith
low energetic acoustic phonons and ordinary supercollisions
have a profound impact on the relaxation dynamics, but
supercollisions do no dramatically change the carrier dynam-
ics.Ontheotherhand,thepresent Letterstudiesoneparticular

phonon mode having an intermediate energy can lead to a
dramatically different relaxation dynamics.
In summary, the relaxation time in Landau-quantized
graphene shows a very distinct dependence on the sample
quality. This is explained by a novel defect-assisted
electron-phonon scattering channel, in which disorder
breaks the mirror symmetry of graphene. These findings
demonstrate that varying the amount of disorder can be
used to tailor the relaxation time in this system over several
orders of magnitude.
