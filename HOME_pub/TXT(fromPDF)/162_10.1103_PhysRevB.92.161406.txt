We introduce an important approach for enhancing the nonlinear response of graphene through its resonant
coupling to a plasmonic metasurface via cascaded Fano resonances. Such a hybrid metasurface supports two types
of subradiant resonant modes, i.e., asymmetric modes of structured metamaterial elements (“metamolecules”)
and graphene plasmons exhibiting strong mutual coupling and avoided dispersion crossing. We demonstrate that
the tunability of graphene plasmons facilitates the strong interaction between the subradiant modes, modifying
the spectral position and lifetime of the Fano resonances. We reveal that a strong resonant interaction, combined
with the subwavelength localization of plasmons, leads to an enhanced nonlinear response and high efﬁciency of
the second-harmonic generation.

Introduction.
Unique
electromagnetic
properties
of
graphene are paving a way towards applications in novel
optical devices [1–9]. One of the main beneﬁts of using
graphene stems from the ability to control its optical response
by changing its chemical potential via electrostatic or chemical
doping [10–14]. While the electromagnetic response of bare
graphene is considered to be strong, it is still not sufﬁcient
for a majority of practical applications. One of the promising
approaches to enhance the optical response of graphene is
to place it into close proximity with metallic or dielectric
photonic structures; this approach has been employed to
design highly tunable infrared and THz metasurfaces enabling
both amplitude and phase modulation [15–21]. In addition,
doped graphene exhibits a plasmonic response, and therefore
it can be patterned to form tunable planar plasmonic metasur-
faces [9,22,23].
In this Rapid Communication, we introduce an approach
for enhancing the interaction of light with graphene, namely,
(i) we design subradiant modes of graphene plasmons and
(ii) we couple them to the conventional subradiant modes
of split-ring resonators of a plasmonic metasurface. While
the former leads to an even stronger conﬁnement of light
to graphene, the latter allows a strong resonant interaction
between two high-Q subradiant modes, enabling strongly
coupled regimes of cascaded Fano resonances [24–26]. We
conﬁrm the beneﬁts of this approach by demonstrating
the strong tunability of not only the spectral position of the
Fano resonances, but also their lifetimes, which cannot be
achieved with other plasmonic metasurfaces where tunability
of the spectral position and phase, but not the lifetime, can be
realized.
Model and parameters. We consider a metasurface com-
posed of a square lattice of pairs of asymmetric split-ring
resonators (SRRs) placed on top of a graphene layer, as
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The electromagnetic response is
calculated by using the ﬁnite-element method solver COMSOL
MULTIPHYSICS with a graphene layer modeled as a surface

√πn is
the Fermi energy, n is the doping electron density, VF ≈
c/300 is the Fermi velocity, and τintra = 0.15 ps is the
relaxation time. At the frequencies ℏω < EF, the Drude-like
conductivity originating in the intraband transitions dominates,
and graphene supports highly conﬁned extremely short-
wavelength p-polarized plasmons, whose dispersion can be
tuned by changing the Fermi energy EF. Considering the
normal incidence of the y-polarized plane wave, we calculate
numerically both the transmission and reﬂection spectra for
different values of the chemical potential.
Without a graphene layer, the metasurface becomes a
conventional two-dimensional metamaterial of double SRRs,
supporting symmetric (superradiant) and asymmetric (subra-
diant) modes that correspond to the in-phase and out-of-phase
current distribution along two arms of the metamolecule
[see Fig. 2(a)]. When the symmetry of the metamolecules is
reduced, the interference between these two modes results in a
characteristic Fano-like asymmetric line shape in the far-ﬁeld
spectra, with the transition illustrated by black dotted and
dashed lines in Fig. 2(c) [26,28–30].
By introducing a graphene layer, we can additionally
excite graphene plasmons, whose wavelength can be tuned
to match one of the characteristic scales of the metasurface.
We notice, however, that even without plasmonic modes
of graphene tuned to the spectral range of interest, the
surface conductivity of graphene modiﬁes the electromagnetic
interactions at the metasurface, leading to an overall blueshift
of the resonances [16]. Due to the subwavelength nature of
graphene plasmons, it is natural to match their wavelength
to the smallest scale associated with the gaps of the SRRs,
which effectively become a cavity for plasmons [18]. Here,
we are interested in graphene plasmons forming a subradiant
mode, where such a mode can be designed from two plasmons
localized within the SRR gaps and interacting with each other

through SRR arms. This interaction gives rise to an asymmetric
subradiant mode with the plasmons within two gaps being out
of phase [see Fig. 2(b)]. Owing to their matching symmetries,
this additional subradiant mode can efﬁciently couple to the
asymmetric mode of SRRs when their frequencies are tuned
[see Fig. 2(c)], resulting in a cascaded Fano resonance in the
far-ﬁeld spectra [31–33]. Moreover, since the wavelength of
the graphene plasmons can be altered by changing the Fermi
energy, this enables a dynamically controllable interaction
between the two subradiant modes, making one of them less
pronounced. Direct numerical calculations of the reﬂection
spectra shown in Fig. 3(a) conﬁrm that the hybrid metasurface
supports one superradiant (broad peak) and two subradiant
(narrow peaks) resonances associated with the Fano reso-
nances, with one of them being highly tunable. Images of
two subradiant modes are shown in Fig. 2(b) for the case
of their strong hybridization. Changing the frequency of the
incident plane wave allows one to observe clearly the features
of two resonances in the near ﬁeld (see the Supplemental
Material [34]).
Analytical approach. The basic principle of the formation
of the cascaded Fano resonances observed in numerical
simulations can be illustrated by applying the coupled-mode
theory [26]. In this approach, each mode of the metasurface
is described by a complex amplitude (S, A, and P), corre-
sponding to the bright symmetric and dark antisymmetric
modes of the SRR, and a dark antiasymmetric graphene
plasmonic mode, respectively. All modes are normalized in
such a way that |S|2, |A|2, and |P|2 are the energy densities.
The amplitudes of the incident E+ and reﬂected E−waves are
also normalized such that |E(+,−)|2 represent the incoming and
outgoing power ﬂuxes. Then, the system dynamics is described
by a set of coupled equations,

A change in the graphene chemical potential leads to a vari-
ation of the spectral position of the plasmonic resonance ωP .
Due to the strong near-ﬁeld coupling of two subradiant modes,
their interaction reveals anticrossing of the associated Fano
resonances, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The analytical model nicely
reproduces this behavior. In Fig. 3(a), transmission calculated
with the use of COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS is superimposed with
the dispersion curves found from the coupled-mode theory,
with parameters recovered from the ﬁtting. The spectral posi-
tions of the noninteracting modes are shown by dashed lines.
Here, the graphene plasmon branch is found from the standing-

. An
interaction between the resonances leads to their hybridization
with the dispersion branches shown by dotted lines.
Since the resonant frequency of graphene plasmons de-
pends on doping, the plasmonic mode intersects with the
subradiant SRR mode, resulting in the characteristic avoided
crossing with the frequency splitting. Both numerical and
analytical results for the splitting are plotted in Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b), where we observe that the tunable anticrossing
behavior described by these approaches agrees perfectly well.
In contrast to conventional plasmonic resonances in
graphene, the subradiant resonance considered here allows
not only tuning its spectral position, but also its coupling to
a radiative continuum. As shown in Fig. 3, the asymmetric
plasmonic mode decays as we move away from the SRR
asymmetric mode, reducing the radiative coupling. Thus,
our metasurface offers control of the spectral position, the
radiative coupling strength, and the phase. The ability to
control radiative coupling can be of special interest for

applications where tunable near-ﬁeld enhancement is a key
requirement. To demonstrate the possibility of control over
the strength of the light-matter interaction, below we con-
sider two examples: (i) tunable absorption enhancement and
(ii) nonlinear second-harmonic generation.
Tunable absorption. Frequency-dependent absorption is
plotted in Fig. 4 for two levels of graphene doping, with the
insets showing the ﬁeld distribution in the gap in the vicinity
of two absorption peaks stemming from the excitation of sub-
radiant modes. The enhanced absorption due to the excitation
of hybrid graphene plasmon-quadrupole resonances clearly
correlates with near-ﬁeld enhancement. As expected, for the
case of poorly interacting subradiant modes, corresponding
to the case of lower Fermi energy (EF = 0.27 eV, shown by
the purple circles in Fig. 4), the asymmetric plasmonic mode
has a smaller amplitude and the losses are not as prominent
as for the asymmetric SRR resonance. For a higher doping
level (EF = 0.307 eV, shown by the red circles in Fig. 4),
the two dark modes are strongly hybridized, leading to a
higher absorption rate by the tunable subradiant mode. This
conﬁrms that the system suggested and analyzed here can be
promising for various applications where tunable strong ﬁeld
enhancement is required.
Nonlinear effects. Being a strongly nonlinear material,
graphene is of great interest for nanoscale nonlinear op-
tics [35], especially in combination with plasmonic ef-
fects [36–38]. Extreme surface conﬁnement of electromag-
netic ﬁelds due to the excitation of plasmons is known to
result in an enhanced nonlinear response [29,39,40]. Such
an enhancement, in particular, was demonstrated for multiple
quantum wells and a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) placed
in proximity to the resonant plasmonic metasurfaces [41,42].
The even stronger ﬁeld conﬁnement in hybrid metasurfaces
proposed here can further boost the efﬁciency of various
nonlinear optical effects.
As an example, we employ the local-ﬁeld enhancement
associated with the excitation of the subradiant plasmonic
mode in graphene for nonlinear frequency conversion and
study the resonant second-harmonic generation (SHG) caused
by the quadratic nonlocal nonlinearity of graphene. The
nonlinear surface current induced in graphene by the incident

i,j,k,l are the Cartesian components. It depends on the

approach based on the Boltzmann equation [44–47], applicable
at low frequencies (ℏω ⩽EF) corresponding to the plasmonic
regime. In what follows, we neglect nonlinearity in metals.
The nonlinear response of the metasurface is simulated
with the help of COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS with the use of
two coupled electromagnetic models assuming an undepleted
pump ﬁeld. First, we perform simulations at the fundamental
(pump) wavelength 10.65 μm (matching one of the radiation
lines of the CO2 laser) and stimulating excitation of the
graphene plasmon resonance in the SRR gap for a doping
level EF = 0.31 eV. Next, the nonlinear current induced at
every point of the graphene surface for the second-harmonic
(SH) frequency is calculated. This current is employed as a
nonlinear source for the electromagnetic simulation and the
SH ﬁelds generated by this current are obtained.
As expected, SHG predominantly arises from the gap,
where the ﬁeld of the asymmetric plasmonic mode is lo-
calized and strongly enhanced. The calculated nonlinear
current generated by this subradiant mode is found to have
a dominant x component driving the entire metasurface at
the SH frequency. As conﬁrmed by numerical simulations
shown in Fig. 5, this results in a nonvanishing nonlinear
dipole moment aligned along the x axis within the SRR
gaps, which leads to the generation of the x-polarized plane
wave in the far-ﬁeld region. It is interesting to note that the
SH wave appears to be cross polarized with respect to the
y-polarized incident plane wave at the fundamental frequency,
indicating a nonlinear polarization conversion. We ﬁnd that
due to the strong ﬁeld enhancement associated with the two
complimentary mechanisms of electromagnetic ﬁeld trapping,
namely, the plasmonic conﬁnement and a subradiant character
of the plasmonic mode, the structure exhibits a high efﬁciency
of nonlinear conversion ∼10−6 at an incident wave intensity
of 1 MW/cm2 even without matching to any resonances at

dependence of the SH ﬁeld component Ex radiated by the
metasurface at the frequency of graphene plasmonic Fano
resonance in the plane perpendicular to the SRR gap can be

Conclusions. We have proposed types of hybrid graphene
metasurfaces exhibiting cascaded Fano resonances which orig-
inate from a strong coupling of subradiant graphene plasmons
with the modes of structured surfaces. We have shown that
such hybrid metasurfaces allow high tunability of the Fano
resonances facilitated by controllable intermode coupling. By
utilizing two complimentary mechanisms of light conﬁnement,
we have shown a signiﬁcant enhancement of light absorption
and nonlinear effects. The demonstrated possibility to enhance
and switch the second-harmonic generation by graphene
gating can be used in various applications, e.g., for efﬁcient
generation of short pulses of the second-harmonic ﬁeld.
