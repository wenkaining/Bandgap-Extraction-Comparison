ABSTRACT: We have synthesized a new layered BiS2-based compound, SrFBiS2. This
compound has a similar structure to LaOBiS2. It is built up by stacking up SrF layers and
NaCl-type BiS2 layers alternatively along the c axis. Electric transport measurement indicates
that SrFBiS2 is a semiconductor. Thermal transport measurement shows that SrFBiS2 has a
small thermal conductivity and large Seebeck coeﬃcient. First principle calculations are in
agreement with experimental results and show that SrFBiS2 is very similar to LaOBiS2,
which becomes a superconductor with F doping. Therefore, SrFBiS2 may be a parent
compound of new superconductors.
■INTRODUCTION
Low-dimensional superconductors with layered structure have
been extensively studied and still attract much interest due to
their exotic superconducting properties and mechanism when
compared to conventional BCS superconductors. The examples
include high Tc cuprates,1 Sr2RuO4,2 NaxCoO2·H2O,3 and iron-
based superconductors.4 The discovery of LnOFePn (Ln = rare
earth elements, Pn = P, As) in particular revitalizes the study of
layered compounds with mixed anions, paving a way to
materials with novel physical properties. For example,
Ln2O2TM2OCh2 (TM = transition metals, Ch = S, Se) show
strong electron−electron interactions and Mott insulating state
on the two-dimensional (2D) frustrated antiferromagnetic
(AFM) checkerboard spin−lattice.5−9 Very recently, bulk
superconductivity was found in BiS2-type layered compounds
with mixed anions: Bi4O4S3 and Ln(O,F)BiS2.10−12 Exper-
imental and theoretical studies indicate that these materials
exhibit multiband behaviors with dominant electron carriers
originating from the Bi 6px and 6px bands in the normal
state.13−16 On the other hand, compounds with mixed anions
exhibit remarkable ﬂexibility of structure. Diﬀerent two-
dimensional (2D) building blocks, such as [LnO]+, [AEF]+
(AE = Ca, Sr, Ba), [Ti2OPn2]2−, [FePn]−, and [TM2OCh2]2−,
can sometimes be integrated to form new materials.4,17−21
Individual building blocks often keep their structural and
electronic properties after being combined together.19
In this work, we report the discovery of a new BiS2-based
layered compound, SrFBiS2. It contains a NaCl-type BiS2 layer
and shows semiconducting behavior with relatively large
thermopower. Theoretical calculations indicate that this
compound is very similar to LnOBiS2.
■EXPERIMENT SECTION
Synthesis. SrFBiS2 polycrystals were synthesized by a two-step
solid-state reaction. First, Bi2S3 was prereacted by reacting Bi needles
(purity 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) with sulfur ﬂakes (purity 99.99%, Aldrich)
in an evacuated quartz tube at 600°C for 10 h. Then Bi2S3 was mixed
with stoichiometric SrF2 (purity 99%, Alfa Aesar) and SrS (purity
99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and intimately ground together using an agate
pestle and mortar. The ground powder was pressed into 10 mm
diameter pellets. We used a maximum pressure of 5 tons. The pressed
pellet was loaded in an alumina crucible and then sealed in quartz
tubes with Ar under the pressure of 0.15 atm. The quartz tubes were
heated to 600°C in 10 h and kept at 600°C for another 10 h.
Structure and Composition Analysis. Phase identity and purity
were conﬁrmed by powder X-ray diﬀraction carried out by a Rigaku
Miniﬂex X-ray machine with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
Structural reﬁnement of powder SrFBiS2 sample was carried out by
using Rietica software.22 Synchrotron X-ray experiment was conducted
at 300 K on a X17A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The setup
utilized a X-ray beam 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm in size and λ = 0.1839 Å (E =
67.4959 keV), conditioned by two-axis focusing with a one-bounce
sagittally bent Laue crystal monochromator and Perkin-Elmer image
plate detector mounted perpendicular to the primary beam path. A
ﬁnely pulverized sample packed in a cylindrical polyimide capillary 1
mm in diameter was placed 204 mm away from the detector. Multiple
scans were performed to a total exposure time of 120 s. The 2D
diﬀraction data were integrated and converted to intensity versus 2θ
using the software FIT2D.23 The intensity data were corrected and
normalized and converted to atomic pair distribution function (PDF),
G(r), using the program PDFgetX2.24 The average stoichiometry of a
SrFBiS2 polycrystal was determined by examination of multiple points
using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a JEOL JSM-
6500 scanning electron microscope.

pellets were cut into rectangular bars, and the surface is polished by
sandpaper. Thin Pt wires were attached using silver epoxy for four
probe resistivity measurements. Electrical and thermal transport
measurements were carried out in quantum design physical property
measurement system (PPMS-9).
Band Structure Calculations. First principle electronic structure
calculations were performed using experimental crystallographic
parameters within the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave
(LAPW) method25 implemented in the WIEN2k package.26 The
general gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew et al.,27 was used for
exchange-correlation potential. The LAPW sphere radius were set to
2.5 Bohr for all atoms, and the converged basis corresponding to
Rminkmax = 7 with additional local orbital were used, where Rmin is the
minimum LAPW sphere radius and kmax is the plane wave cutoﬀ.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure and Compostion. Figure 1(a) shows the
powder XRD pattern of SrFBiS2 measured by Rigaku Miniﬂex.
Almost all of reﬂections can be indexed using the P4/nmm
space group. The unidentiﬁed peaks belong to the second
phase of Bi2S3. Using two-phase Le Bail ﬁtting, the reﬁned
lattice parameters of SrFBiS2 are a = 4.084(2) Å and c =
13.798(2) Å. When compared to LaOBiS2, the a-axial lattice
parameter is larger, and the c-axial one is slightly smaller.11 The
PDF structural analysis was carried out using the program
PDFgui.28 The SrFBiS2 data are explained well within the
model having P4/nmm symmetry with a = 4.079(2) Å and c =
13.814(5) Å (Rwp = 0.138, χ2 = 0.024). It is consistent with the
ﬁtting results obtained from Miniﬂex. The ﬁnal ﬁt is shown in
Figure 1(b), and the results are summarized in Table 1. In
addition to the principal phase, the sample is found to have
∼16(1) wt % of Bi2S3 impurity with Pnma symmetry, which is
also observed in Figure 1(a). The structure of SrFBiS2 is similar
to LaOBiS2, which is built up by stacking the rock salt-type BiS2
layer and ﬂuorite-type SrF layer alternatively along the c axis as
shown Figure 1(c). The EDX spectrum of polycrystal conﬁrms
the presence of Sr, F, Bi, and S. The average atomic ratios

SrFBiS2.
Electrical Properties. As shown in Figure 2, the resistivity
ρ(T) of SrFBiS2 polycrystalline shows a semiconducting
behavior in the measured temperature region (1.9−300 K). It
should be noted that Bi2S3 polycrystal shows metallic behavior
because of sulfur deﬁciency.29 The impurity may have some
minor inﬂuence on the absolute value of resistivity, but the
semiconducting behavior should be intrinsic. Neglecting the
grain boundary contribution, the room-temperature resistivity
ρ(300 K) is about 0.5 Ω cm. Using the thermal activation
model ρab(T) = ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT) (ρ0 is a prefactor, Ea thermal
activated energy, and kB the Boltzmann’s constant) to ﬁt the
ρ(T) at high temperature (75−300 K) (inset of Figure 2), we
obtain Ea = 31.8(3) meV. The semiconductor behavior is
consistent with theoretical calculation result shown below. On
the other hand, theoretical calculations have indicated that
undoped LaOBiS2 is also a semiconductor, which is partially
consistent with the experimental result.13,30 The transport
measurement indicates that LaOBiS2 shows semiconducting
behavior at T < 200 K but exhibit an upturn of resistivity at
higher temperature. The origin of the upturn is unclear.
Therefore, the replacement of LaO by SrF should not change
the band structure and thus physical properties too much,
especially at low temperature, similar to the relation between
SrFFeAs and LaOFeAs.18,31 The slight diﬀerences between
LaOBiS2 and SrFBiS2, such as larger a-axial and smaller c-axial
lattice parameters, could result in changing of physical
properties at higher temperature. Note that the semiconducting
ρ(T) in LaOBiS2 and SrFBiS2 are diﬀerent from those in parent
compounds of iron pnictide superconductors. The latter show
metallic behaviors at high temperature and a semiconducting-
like upturn in the resistivity curve related to the spin density
wave (SDW) transition. There is no signiﬁcant magneto-
resistance in SrFBiS2 up to 90 kOe magnetic ﬁeld.
Thermal Transport Properties. The temperature depend-
ences of the thermal conductivity κ(T) and thermoelectric
power (TEP) S(T) for SrFBiS2 in zero ﬁeld between 2 and 350
K are shown in Figure 3. The electronic thermal conductivity

Bκe(T) estimated from the Wiedemann−Franz law using a value
for the Lorenz number of 2.44 × 10−8 W Ω/K2 was less than 5
× 10−6 of κ(T). Therefore, lattice thermal conductivity
dominates κL(T), which exhibits a peak at around 60 K (Figure
1(a)). The peak in κ(T) commonly arises because diﬀerent
phonon scattering processes usually dominate in diﬀerent
temperature ranges. Umklapp scattering dominates at high
temperatures, while boundary and point-defect scattering
dominate at low and intermediate temperatures, respectively.32
On the other hand, the κ(T) of SrFBiS2 shows similar behavior
to Bi4O4S3 but with diﬀerent peak position and absolute
value.16 For TEP S(T) of SrFBiS2, there is a reversal in sign at
about 11 K, i.e, hole-like carrier changes into electron-like
carrier, which is dominant at room temperature. According to
two band model, S = |Sh|σh −|Se|σe/(σe + σh).16 If we assume
that Sh and Se are temperature independent, it suggests that
electron and hole conductivities change dramatically with
temperature: at low temperature, σh > σe whereas σe > σh above
11 K. Hole-like carriers may originate from defect induced p-
type doping. With increasing temperature, electron-like carriers
due to intrinsic band excitation increase signiﬁcantly, ﬁnally
leading to σe > σh and a sign change in S(T). Similar behavior
was observed in LaOZnP and p-type Si.33,34 Even though the
S(T) in SrFBiS2 is signiﬁcant and not much smaller than in
classics thermoelectric materials,35 its low electrical conductivity
makes its ﬁgure of merit ZT (ZT = σS2T/κ) extremely small.
Electronic Structure. First principle calculations (Figure 4)
conﬁrm that SrFBiS2 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap
of 0.8 eV located at X point. This is similar to LaOBiS2 where
the energy gap was found to be 0.82 eV.36 The calculation
conﬁrms the results of transport measurement. Similar to
LaOBiS2,13,36 both S 3p and Bi 6p states are located around the
Fermi level (−2.0 to 2.0 eV) in SrFBiS3p. Thus there is a
strong hybridization between S 3p and Bi 6p states. The
absence of dispersion along Γ−Z line suggests quasi two-
dimensional character of the band structure in SrFBiS2 (Figure
4(b)). In LaOBiS2, F doping results in metallic states and
superconductivity at low temperature. The main inﬂuence of F
substitution is a carrier doping that shifts the Fermi level and
has only a minor eﬀect on the lowest conduction band. Because
of the similarity between SrFBiS2 and LaOBiS2, new super-
conductors could be obtained by chemical substitution.

C■CONCLUSION
In summary, we report a discovery of a new layered
ﬂuorosulﬁde, SrFBiS2. It contains a NaCl-type BiS2 layer
similar to Bi4O4S3 and Ln(O,F)BiS2 superconductors. SrFBiS2
polycrystals show semiconducting behavior between 2 and 300
K. We observe rather small thermal conductivity and large TEP
with sign reversal at low temperature. Theoretical calculation
conﬁrms the semiconducting behavior and indicates a similar
DOS and band structure to undoped LaOBiS2. Because of the
similarity between SrFBiS2 and the parent compound of BiS2-
based superconductors, it is of interest to investigate the doping
eﬀects on physical properties of SrFBiS2. It could pave a way to
new members in this emerging family of BiS2-based super-
conductors.
