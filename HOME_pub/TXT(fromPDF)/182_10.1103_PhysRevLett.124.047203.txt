We show that it is possible to engineer magnetic multidomain configurations without domain walls in a
prototypical rare-earth–transition-metal ferrimagnet using keV Heþ ion bombardment. We additionally
show that these patterns display a particularly stable magnetic configuration due to a deep minimum in the
energy of the system caused by flux closure and a corresponding reduction of the magnetostatic energy
without an increase in energy by exchange and anisotropy terms across the walls. This occurs because light-
ion bombardment affects an element’s relative contribution to the properties of the ferrimagnet differently.
Therefore, it is possible to control the relative contribution from each magnetic subsystem. The selection of
material and the use of light-ion bombardment allow us to engineer domain patterns in continuous magnetic
films, which open a way to fabricate them in a much smaller scale than currently possible. Our Letter
emphasizes that the right criterion to determine the presence or absence of a domain wall is whether there is
a rotation of the spin for each sublattice and that changes of the direction of effective magnetization alone
do not constitute an appropriate criterion.

The ability to create lateral magnetic domain patterns in
ferromagnetic films is crucial for numerous applications.
Their use in magnetic mass memories [1–3] is established,
but they are also useful in magnonics [4,5] and in magneto-
phoresis-based lab-on-a-chip devices [6–9]. In ferromag-
nets, magnetic domains are uniformly magnetized regions,
in which the effective magnetization points in a defined
direction. Naturally occurring domain patterns are formed as
a result of a compromise among exchange, anisotropy, and
stray field energy [4,6,10,11]. The domains are separated by
domain walls (DWs), which are transition regions where the
magnetic moments reorient. Their widths are the natural size
limit for individual domains. Therefore, the lateral DW
widths are also the critical dimension for magnetic domains
in continuous layers. Domain patterns can be engineered
by local modification of magnetic properties such as the
coercive field (HC) [12–15]. In the past, this has been
achieved, e.g., by light-ion bombardment through masks
[13,14,16,17] or by focused ion beams [18–21]. However,
even these precise methods are not able to engineer domains
of lateral dimensions below the corresponding DW widths.
Here we describe a method to engineer magnetic
domain patterns without lateral DWs in a ferrimagnetic
system. This unique method promises magnetic domains in
continuous layer systems of dimensions well below the
typical ferromagnetic DW widths. Although the physics of
magnetic domain formation in ferrimagnetic films is similar
to that in ferromagnetic films [10], the presence of two
magnetic moment subsystems leads to more complex
configurations. Exchange coupled double layers (ECDL)
consisting of rare-earth (RE)–transition-metal (TM) ele-
ments with alternating stoichiometric domination of RE
(REþ) or TM (TMþ) will contain interfacial DWs at
saturation and lack of them at remanence [22–28] (Fig. 1 in
Ref. [24] and Fig. 1 in Ref. [28]). This peculiar situation is
possible because parallel effective magnetizations (mono-
domain state) in the REþ and TMþ layers correspond to
antiparallel magnetic moments of the magnetic subsystems
(DW is present) of the same type (RE or TM) [24] (in
Ref. [28] this magnetic state is described as an interfacial
DW separating two domains with the same direction of the
effective magnetization). After the magnetization reverses
in one of the layers, the magnetization of the layers will be
oriented antiparallel to each other. However, the magneti-
zation of each subsystem will maintain its orientation on
both sides of the interface (DW is not present and that can
be described as a nontwisted domain wall). It should be
emphasized that in ECDL films the switching fields are
distinctly influenced by creation and annihilation of inter-
facial DWs. Note that the first studies of ECDL consisting
of REþ and TMþ sublayers were performed on alloyed
RE-TM films in which the upper part of a RE- dominated

oxidation of the RE element [29].
We will demonstrate that Heþ ion bombardment allows us
to modify the magnetic properties of ferrimagnetic Tb=Co
films exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy [30–36].
We will also show that, with increasing dose of Heþ ions, the
Tb contribution to the effective magnetization decreases
strongly relative to Co. This opens a way to pattern REþ
ferrimagnetic films with light ions to locally switch the
domination to TMþ. Thus, analogous to ferrimagnetic
ECDL films, magnetic domains can be produced at rema-
nence without DWs. Using this patterning technique, we
have fabricated a laterally periodic domain pattern consisting
of a lattice of low HC TMþ squares embedded in a high HC
REþ matrix.
The subjects of our investigations are Tb=Co multilayers
displaying, for small sublayer thicknesses, magnetic proper-
ties similar to amorphous Tb-Co alloy films [30–34].
The ðTb-wedge0-2 nm=Co-0.66 nmÞ6 layer system was
magnetron sputtered to determine the influence of the
10 keV Heþ ion bombardment on the properties of the
ðTb=CoÞ6 films as a function of the thickness ratio between
Co and Tb layers, i.e., as a function of the nominal
composition. The sample was bombarded with two Heþ
ion doses D of 1 × 1015 and 3 × 1015 ions=cm2 using a
home-built plasma source [37] (details are given in the
Supplemental Material [38]). The composition depth pro-
files of the as-deposited and bombarded samples were
investigated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS)
(Fig. 1) with the CAMECA SC Ultra instrument [39–41]
(see Supplemental Material [38]). These results confirm
that, before and after ion bombardment, the samples
show similar and weak depth-dependent modulation of
composition.
The magnetic properties were investigated with a mag-
netometer and a microscope using the polar magneto-
optical Kerr effect (P-MOKE). Figure 2 shows changes
of the coercive field as a function of the Tb sublayer
thickness [HCðtTbÞ] for an unbombarded area and two
areas bombarded with D ¼ 1 × 1015 Heþ=cm2 and D ¼
3 × 1015 Heþ=cm2.

[Fig. 2(a)]. Note that the hysteresis loops for systems with

orientations
[Figs. 2(b)–2(d)]. This occurs because, for the wavelength
used in the P-MOKE setup (640 nm), the Co subsystem

It can be seen that the tcomp

and ccomp

values increase
with increasing D, showing that the relative magnetic
contribution of Tb to ferrimagnetic properties of the
Tb=Co system can be reduced by ion bombardment. Let
us analyze the changes of the magnetic properties of the
Tb=Co system with tTb ¼ 1.1 nm (tTb > tcomp

) caused by
ion bombardment. In the as-deposited state, this system
is Tbþ [Fig. 2(b)]. After ion bombardment with D ¼

an orientation indicating the same dominance, but now HC

047203-2is higher. Increasing D to 3 × 1015 Heþ=cm2 [Fig. 2(d)]
modifies the system so that the Co magnetic subsystem
starts to dominate.
The change of the SIMS depth profile caused by
bombardment with D ¼ 3 × 1015 Heþ=cm2, ðTb-1.1 nm=
Co-0.66 nmÞ6 (Fig. 1) strongly suggests that a decrease of
the Tb contribution to the ferrimagnetic properties of the
Tb=Co system is mainly caused by the preferential oxida-
tion of Tb. In particular, this is confirmed by the con-
currence of terbium and oxygen peaks in the depth profile
of the bombarded sample. The results presented in
Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that, by using local ion bombardment
for the Tb-dominated Tb=Co system, heterostructures
consisting of Co-dominating areas can be created in a
Tb-dominated
matrix.
By
analogy
with
the
system
described in Ref. [24], this is an important result, paving
the way for engineering magnetic patterns without DWs.
To prove such a possibility, we performed Heþ ion
bombardment through a resist mask with dose D ¼
3 × 1015 Heþ=cm2 (see Supplemental Material [38]) for
a selected tTb ¼ 1.1 nm and studied the magnetization
reversal
of
the
magnetically
patterned
ðTb-1.1 nm=
Co-0.66 nmÞ6 film. Note that the bombarded areas are
TMþ, in contrast to the matrix, and have lower HC. Four
1 × 1 mm2 areas were patterned on the same sample with
periodically arranged squares of side lengths a ¼ 3, 12.5,
25, and 100 μm and distances between the centers of
neighboring squares of 2a (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental
Material [38]).
Full and minor P-MOKE hysteresis loops for all pat-
terned areas are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the magnetic
moment configurations of the two magnetic subsystems of
the ferrimagnet corresponding to the states 1–4 in the loops
are sketched in Fig. 3(c). The Co and Tb spin distributions
at the interface between REþ and TMþ areas in states
1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 4(e) and 4(g), respectively.
Additionally, reference MOKE measurements were per-
formed on a 1 × 1 mm2 area bombarded with D ¼
3 × 1015 Heþ=cm2, as well as for an unbombarded area
[Fig. 3(b)]. Note that the dimensions of the reference
areas were much larger than the laser spot used for the
P-MOKE characterization. Therefore, the hysteresis loops
measured in the central part of the reference areas are not
affected by the border regions between the bombarded
and unbombarded areas. The situation is different for the
patterned periodic square lattices where hysteresis loops are
the approximate superposition of those obtained for the
reference areas. The P-MOKE signal ratio corresponding to
magnetization reversal of the squares and matrix is
equal to the ratio of the areas of these regions, which is
1=3. Only for the largest squares the observed ratio is not
exactly 1=3 because the size of the individual squares
approaches the diameter of the P-MOKE laser spot; in
consequence, the signal does not average over several
squares.
Hereinafter, the switching fields Hif
S will identify tran-
sitions between the specific states marked with superscripts
for the initial (i) and final (f) states; e.g., H12
S and H34

ally no dependence is observed for H34

047203-3This indicates a relatively weak magnetostatic interaction
between the squares and matrix due to the low saturation
magnetization (MS) and small thicknesses of the films [44].
Exchange coupling at the borders between the squares and
matrix contributes weakly, too, to the effective interaction
because of the small interaction surface (film thickness
multiplied by the perimeter length of a square).
Since the bombarded areas have lower HS and are TMþ
and the matrix is REþ with higher HS, then the magneti-
zation reversals 1 →2 and 3 →4 occur inside the squares
(Fig. 2S and Video 1 in the Supplemental Material [38]). In
states 1 and 3 (at saturation), the effective magnetizations of
the squares and matrix are both oriented along the magnetic
field; at the same time, the magnetizations of each magnetic
subsystem (Co and Tb) rotate to the antiparallel direction
acrossthe bordersbetween the squaresand matrix [Figs.3(c)
and 4(e)]. Therefore, in states 1 and 3, DWs exist at the
borders of the squares. At fields H12
S and H34
S , the squares
reverse (the effective magnetizations of the squares and
matrix are now antiparallel to each other) and the DWs are
annihilated.
The comparison of the magnetic configurations of
states 1(3) and 2(4) [Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)] suggest that, at
remanence, states 2 and 4 are energetically more favorable
than states 1 and 3. This is caused by both a reduction of
the magnetostatic energy (the effective magnetization in the
squares is antiparallel to that of the matrix) and by the
annihilation of DWs (note that, in contrast to the situation
of ECDL films [24], the same orientation of effective
magnetizations increases the magnetostatic energy). As a
result, processes 1 →2 and 3 →4 involve a reduction of
the free energy in the system, while the opposite processes
(2 →1 and 4 →3, in minor loops) are accompanied by an
increase. Although the individual squares reverse inde-
pendently, the values H12
S and H34
S [Fig. 3(a)] are close to
the HC value of the modified reference area [Fig. 3(b)] and
show a narrow distribution, while jH21
S j and jH43
S j (4 →3,
not shown) are greater than the jHCj of the reference area
and have a large spread [Fig. 3(d)] (see Video 2 in the
Supplemental Material [38]). The influence of a on the
abovementioned switching fields is stronger for smaller a
(the greater sum of DW lengths), and their increased spread
broadening as a is reduced can be attributed to the spatial
distribution of magnetic properties due to deposition
and ion bombardment through the resist [45–47]. For the
magnetic file sweep direction used in our experiment, the
shift of minor loops (HMLS) seen in Fig. 3(a) is negative,
indicating an antiferromagnetic coupling between the
TMþ squares and the REþ matrix. The origin of this
coupling is related to the elimination of the antiparallel
configuration of magnetization in the Co and Tb magnetic
subsystems (annihilation of DWs). Processes 2 →3 and
4 →1 take place by propagation of DWs in the matrix
(see Fig. 3S in the Supplemental Material [38]) and involve
DW creation.
To support qualitatively our interpretation of the experi
mental data, we have performed micromagnetic simula-
tions using the object oriented micromagnetic framework
(OOMMF) [48] without any additional extensions. Details
are described in the Supplemental Material [38], but the
essentials can be described as follows: We generate a grid of
cubic cells of side 0.5 nm and randomly assign a magnetic
material (RE or TM) to each cell to mimic their correspond-
ing concentrations (65% TM, 35% RE). In the bombarded
area, we deactivate a fraction of the cells assigned to the rare-
earth element (71%) by reducing their magnetization to zero
to model its oxidation.
Typical full and minor simulated loops for the patterned
strip are shown in Fig. 4(a). The full loop is a two-step
hysteresis with intermediate states similar to those described
in the discussion of Fig. 3(a). Note that in Fig. 3(a), the
dependence of the P-MOKE signal (strongly dominated by
the Co subsystem) on the magnetic field is shown, while in
Fig. 4(a), the one of the effective magnetization is shown.
State 1 corresponds to saturation in negative field where the
effective moments in both REþ and TMþ regions are
aligned parallel to the field [Fig. 4(f)]; for state 2, the
effective moment in the bombarded area is opposite that
of the matrix [Fig. 4(h)]. Close-up views of these configu-
rations are shown in Figs. 4(e)) and 4(g). These transversal
cross sections show the difference between the two states: In
state 1, the effective magnetization is negative everywhere,
except precisely at the edge of the bombarded area where the
magnetization of each subsystem undergoes rotation, i.e.,
where the DWs are located; while state 2 does not contain a
DW even though the two regions have opposite effective
magnetizations. These two images support the key finding of
our Letter, namely, that a REþ ferrimagnetic system can be
patterned by keV He ion bombardment allowing multiple
domains without DWs (states 2, 4). Because of the strong
antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co and the Tb
subsystems [49], the spin structure of the DWs is similar
to the interfacial DWs found in the ECDL films (Fig. 14
in Ref. [50]).
Having shown that in ferrimagnetic films consisting of
TMþ areas embedded in an REþ matrix the antiparallel
configuration of the effective magnetization can exist
without DWs at the borders between the REþ and TMþ
areas, we now show that at the field-induced transition
between states 1 and 2, the reduction in anisotropy energy
and exchange energy is accompanied by a reduction of
magnetostatic energy. Overall, flux closure is achieved with
the annihilation of the DW. Figures 4(b)–4(d) show the
anisotropy, magnetostatic, and exchange energies as a
function of the magnetic field for the down sweep branch
of the hysteresis loop. In state 2, which occupies the middle
region of this graph (−1.9 kOe ≤H ≤−0.3 kOe), we see
that due to annihilation of DWs the exchange energy and
the sum of the anisotropy and magnetostatic energies are
reduced. It is also apparent that the magnetostatic energy in
state 2 is generally lower than in state 1. Therefore, such a
PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 124, 047203 (2020)
047203-4magnetic configuration is very stable and is characterized
by a deep free-energy minimum, which explains the
strong negative value of HMLS observed both in experiment
[Fig. 3(a)] and simulations [Fig. 4(a)]. This confirms that it
is possible to achieve flux closure in the absence of DWs,
which explains why the observed unique features are
particularly stable and energetically advantageous.
It has been shown that, in a rare-earth–transition-metal
ferrimagnetic system, magnetic domains can be engineered
without DWs using 10 keV Heþ ion bombardment. These
magnetic configurations are particularly stable due to a
deep minimum in the free energy of the system, which is
caused by flux closure and the corresponding reduction of
magnetostatic energy without an increase in energy by
exchange and anisotropy terms across the walls. As a result,
a much larger magnetic field is required to annihilate such a
magnetic pattern than to create it. The fundamental effect
used for engineering of such domains without DWs is that
the impact of keV light-ion bombardment to effective
properties of ferrimagnetic films is related to preferential
oxidation of rare earth. Therefore, the technique can be
used in this system to control the relative contributions of
the two magnetic subsystems. Thus, starting with magnetic
Tb=Co films where the Tb magnetization dominates and
using ion bombardment, we have created magnetic patterns
where areas with Co magnetic moment density domination
and small coercive fields were embedded in the matrix that
retained the magnetic properties of the as-deposited system.
