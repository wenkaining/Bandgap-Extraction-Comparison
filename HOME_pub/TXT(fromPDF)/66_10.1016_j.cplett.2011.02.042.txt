The structural stability of K4 nitrogen was studied by performing ﬁrst-principles calculations. The total
energy as a function of isotropic deformations and volume-conserving tetragonal and trigonal deforma-
tions was calculated. The total energy was a minimum under all three deformations, suggesting that K4
nitrogen is a mechanically stable phase. However, the results of phonon dispersion calculations indicated
that it is dynamically unstable. Our results also indicated that structural stability can be maintained by
doping the K4 nitrogen lattice with carbon, and that the resulting material will be a promising candidate
as a high energy density material.

1. Introduction
At ambient and room temperature conditions, nitrogen usually
freezes into N2 molecules in which two atoms are strongly triple
bonded; N2 molecules are weakly bonded by a van der Waals bond
[1]. Under high pressure, however, nitrogen can form various poly-
meric polymorphs [2,3]. Because of the uniquely large energy dif-
ference between single and triple bonds, single-covalent-bonded
nitrogen can be considered a most promising candidate for a high
energy density material [4]. The calculated energy density of
single-bonded nitrogen is approximately 0.4 eV/cm3, which is
nearly three times larger than that of the most powerful energetic
material [4]. Therefore, ﬁnding single-bonded nitrogen has long
been a topic of interest, and a number of theoretical and experi-
mental efforts in that direction have been made [4]. Thus far, only
cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) has been theoretically predicted and
successfully synthesized [5].
On the basis of Sunada’s mathematical analysis [6], a new carbon
polytype, K4 carbon, which can be regarded as a twin of cubic dia-
mond, has been theoretically predicted [7]. Recently, K4 carbon
has been described as an sp2-hybridized three-dimensional crystal
structure [7–9]. Because the K4 crystal structure has bonding
arrangements different from those of ordinary crystals, its physical
and chemical properties are of great interest. Many theoretical stud-
ies have been reported recently. For example, ab initio calculations
by Itoh et al. in 2008 reveal that both K4 carbon and K4-like MC2 ex-
hibit metallic properties with respect to electrical conductivity
[7,10], which suggests that they may be used in various future
applications. In 2009, Yao et al. and Liang et al. investigated the
structural stability of K4 carbon by analyzing its phonon-band struc-
ture [11] and elastic constants [12], respectively. In 2010, Dai et al.
investigated K4-structure boron by ﬁrst-principles calculations [13].
K4 crystals are bonded with a single bond, structurally similar to
cg-N [5–7]. Motivated by the intriguing properties of single-
bonded nitrogen and its potential as a high energy density mate-
rial, we investigated the structural stability of K4 nitrogen and
50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen using ﬁrst-principle calculations.
For our computational analysis, we used density functional the-
ory (DFT) and the plane-wave pseudopotential technique imple-
mented in the CASTEP package [14]. Ion–electron interactions
were modeled using ultrasoft pseudopotentials [15]. We used
generalized
gradient
approximation
[16]
with
the
Perdew
BurkeErnzerhof [17] exchange–correlation functional. The kinetic
cutoff energy for plane waves was set to 600 eV. The k point sepa-
ration in the Brillouin zone of reciprocal space was 0.04 nm1 (i.e.,
5  5  5 for K4 nitrogen, 3  3  1 for P41212 nitrogen, 4  4  2
for P-421M nitrogen, 5  5  5 for cg-N, and 4  4  4 for 50% car-
bon-doped K4 nitrogen). The phonon frequencies were calculated
using the PHONON code [18].
On the basis of existing crystallographic data for nitrogen poly-
morphs [3], we built the initial crystal structures of P41212 nitro-
gen, P-421M nitrogen, and cg-N. The initial crystal structures of
K4 nitrogen had already been built by imitating K4 carbon [7],
and the initial crystal structures of 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen
had been built by replacing half of nitrogen atoms in K4 nitrogen
lattice by carbon. The lattice parameters and internal coordinates
of the ﬁve polymorphs were optimized using ﬁrst-principle calcu-
lations and by conserving the original symmetry. The calculated

responding mass densities are shown in Table 1. Our calculated re-
sults agree well with Pickard’s calculated results [3].
Since we do not consider temperature effects, the pressure-
dependent thermodynamic stability of nitrogen polymorphs can
be determined by comparing their enthalpies [19]. We optimized
the geometries of these nitrogen polymorphs under pressure by
using DFT, and we obtained the enthalpies for the optimized poly-
morphs under pressures of up to 200 GPa. The relationship be-
tween enthalpy and pressure for various nitrogen polymorphs is
plotted in Figure 1. At pressures below 41 GPa, P41212 nitrogen
is the most energetically stable nitrogen phase among the nitrogen
polymorphs considered here. At pressures higher than 41 GPa, cg-
N becomes the most stable phase with increasing pressure. At
pressures higher than 180 GPa, P-421M nitrogen becomes more
energetically stable than cg-N. For K4 nitrogen, the enthalpy is still
larger than that of cg-N and P-421M nitrogen.
The mechanical stabilities of crystal structures can be estimated
from their elastic constants. A cubic crystal has three independent
elastic moduli: the bulk modulus, B = (C11 + 2C12)/3, and two shear
moduli, G0 = (C11C12)/2 and G = C44. Thus, the mechanical stability
imposes restrictions on the elastic constants, which for cubic crys-
tals are [20,21]
C11 > 0; C44 > 0; C11  C12 > 0; C11 þ 2C12 > 0:
In other words, for a cubic lattice to be mechanically stable, the
total energy surface should have a local minimum for isotropic,
tetragonal, and trigonal deformations. Therefore, we studied the
mechanical stabilities of K4 nitrogen and 50% carbon-doped K4
nitrogen by calculating the total energy as a function of the volume
and then as a function of volume-conserving orthorhombic and
monoclinic strains at the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters.

B. Wen et al. / Chemical Physics Letters 506 (2011) 175–178The total energy as a function of isotropic, tetragonal, and trigo-
nal deformations was calculated for K4 nitrogen and 50% carbon-
doped K4 nitrogen by setting the atomic fractional coordinates to
the optimized values, and they are plotted in Figures 2 and 3,
respectively. Figure 2a,b and c show the total energy as a function
of isotropic, tetragonal, and trigonal deformations, respectively, for
K4 nitrogen. Figure 2a shows the calculated total energy as a func-
tion of lattice parameter a under isotropic deformation. The total
energy has a minimum value as a function of lattice parameter a,
which implies that the bulk modulus B is positive. In addition, a
has an equilibrium value of 3.915 Å, which agrees with the value
given in Table 1. Figure 2b and c show plots of the total energy
as a function of volume-conserving tetragonal and trigonal defor-
mations, respectively. For a tetragonal deformation, when c/a = 1,
the structure is K4 nitrogen. As Figure 2b shows, the calculated to-
tal energy has a local minimum at c/a = 1, which means that the K4
carbon cubic crystal is stable under volume-conserving tetragonal
deformations. Figure 2c shows the computational results for trigo-
nal deformation. In this case, the lattice vectors are redeﬁned as
those of a hexagonal lattice based on the original cubic lattice; that
is, the [01–1] and [1 1 1] directions in the cubic lattice are rede-
ﬁned as a and c directions in the hexagonal lattice, respectively.
When c/a = 1.225, the structure is a K4 nitrogen structure, and
the calculated total energy has a local minimum. This result im-
plies that K4 nitrogen is stable under volume-conserving trigonal
deformations. Overall, our results indicate that K4 nitrogen is
mechanically stable under isotropic deformations and volume-
conserving tetragonal and trigonal deformations.
Figure 3a–c show the total energies as functions of isotropic,
tetragonal and trigonal deformations for 50% carbon-doped K4
nitrogen, respectively. As Figure 3a shows, the calculated total en-
ergy has a minimum as a function of lattice parameter a, and the
equilibrium value obtained for lattice parameter a is 3.9503 Å,
which agrees with the optimized value shown in Table 1. In the
same way as for K4 nitrogen, for tetragonal deformation, the struc-
ture is 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen when c/a = 1. As Figure 2b

177shows, the calculated total energy has a local maximum when c/
a = 1. In the same way as for K4 nitrogen, for trigonal deformation,
the lattice vectors are redeﬁned as hexagonal lattice based on the
original cubic lattice; that is, the [01–1] direction is redeﬁned as
a in the hexagonal lattice, and the [1 1 1] direction is redeﬁned
as c in the hexagonal lattice. As Figure 2c shows, when c/
a = 1.225, the structure is the 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen struc-
ture, and the calculated total energy has a local minimum at this
point. These results imply that 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen is
also mechanically stable under all three deformations.
To further study the dynamic stability of K4 nitrogen and 50%
carbon-doped K4 nitrogen, phonon-band structures were calcu-
lated at 0 GPa, and they are plotted in Figure 4a and b, respectively.
As shown in Figure 4a, an imaginary phonon mode exists for K4
nitrogen; thus, it is mechanically unstable and cannot be synthe-
sized experimentally. But for 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen, its
phonon-band structures in Figure 4a shows that no imaginary pho-
non band mode exists; thus, it is dynamically stable. This indicated
that 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen is a metastable phase, and it
may be synthesized experimentally.
The heat of formation of 50% carbon-doped K4 nitrogen with re-
spect to graphite and N2 molecular was evaluated to be 671.30 kJ/
mol NC unit, which implies that synthesizing 50% carbon-doped K4
nitrogen from graphite and N2 molecular will require high ener-
gies. Our calculations also indicated that 50% carbon-doped K4
nitrogen exhibits metallic properties with respect to electrical con-
ductivity, which suggests that it may be used in a variety of appli-
cations besides of high energy density material in the future.
In summary, the structural stabilities of K4 nitrogen and 50%
carbon-doped K4 nitrogen were studied by performing ﬁrst-princi-
ples calculations. Our calculations indicated that the total energy of
K4 nitrogen has a minimum under isotropic deformations and vol-
ume-conserving tetragonal and trigonal deformations. These re-
sults indicate that K4 nitrogen is a mechanically stable phase, but
phonon calculations results indicate that it is a dynamically unsta-
ble phase. Our calculations results also indicate that 50% carbon-
doped K4 nitrogen is a structurally stable phase, suggesting that
it is a promising candidate as a high energy density material.
