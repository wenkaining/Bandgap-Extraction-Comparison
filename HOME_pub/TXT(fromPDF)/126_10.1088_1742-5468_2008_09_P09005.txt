Abstract.
This paper investigates
the applicability of classical,
Gibbs–
Boltzmann statistical mechanics to the phenomenon of non-thermal damage. As
an example, a non-thermal ﬁber-bundle model with the global uniform (mean
ﬁeld) load sharing is considered. Stochastic topological behavior in the system
is described in terms of an eﬀective temperature parameter that thermalizes the
system. An equation of state and a topological analogue of the energy-balance
equation are obtained. The formalism of the free energy potential is developed,
and the nature of the ﬁrst-order phase transition and spinodal is demonstrated.
Keywords: rigorous results in statistical mechanics, classical phase transitions
(theory), fracture (theory), phase transformations (theory)

1. Introduction
Damage as a complex phenomenon has been studied by many authors and a survey of
recent developments in damage mechanics can be found in [1]–[3]. Although temperature
as a parameter could be included in the consideration the models of damage usually do
not require its presence. Instead, the damage phenomenon is described by the topological
stochasticity of fracture surfaces. Stochastic ‘geometric’ behavior of the system carries on
the role of thermal ﬂuctuations.
A natural question arises: can we describe the topological ﬂuctuations in the system
in terms of an eﬀective temperature parameter? If the temperature is naturally absent
but the stochastic behavior carries on its role, the question above can be reformulated
as: can the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics (further equilibrium statistical
mechanics (ESM)) be extended to non-thermal damage phenomena?
Many attempts [4]–[10] have been made to answer these questions.
One of the
important approaches was suggested by Smalley et al [11].
To model damage they
actually used Dyson’s hierarchical model developed in ESM (see [12] and further citations
in the literature). Another important approach was developed by Blumberg Selinger et
al [7]. They used a Hamiltonian formalism to apply ESM to the damage phenomenon.
However, other studies indicate that damage is a transient phenomenon and the concepts
of equilibrium in the traditional understanding of ESM cannot be applied.
This paper develops a rigorous, systematic approach to these questions.
It could
be expected that the direct applications of the equilibrium and energy concepts of ESM
to transient topological phenomena are neither correct nor possible. Instead, the basic
variables of ESM like temperature, energy and free energy potential should be mapped
onto their topological analogs. The concept of equilibrium as a state of a system in the
detailed balance with a medium should not be used directly. Instead, the new concept of
stochastic topologic equilibrium should be introduced.

Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
Therefore we should start from the basic principles and follow a step-by-step
comparison between ESM and non-thermal damage phenomena. In this way we could
ﬁnd the topological analogs of the equation of state, energy-balance equation and free
energy potential. The knowledge of the free energy potential would give us the complete
knowledge of the system. In particular, the behavior of possible phase transitions in the
system would be classiﬁed by it.
The nature of damage phenomena is assumed to be represented by the stochasticity
of its topological occurrence. The stochastic equilibrium is assumed to be prescribed as
an external stochastic constraint (further external stochastic constraint (e.g. temperature
dictated by the medium in the canonical ensemble) (SC)). In other words, the equilibrium
probability distributions are dictated by a priori assigned model stochasticity. Application
of the mathematical formalism of ESM describes this SC in terms of the eﬀective
temperature parameter that thermalizes the system. In other words, stochastic topologic
ﬂuctuations are mapped on thermal ﬂuctuations of ESM and prescribed SC is mapped on
the SC of the classical canonical ensemble (temperature dictated by an external medium).
The main purpose of the paper remains to illustrate why ESM is not applicable directly to
damage mechanics and how we are still able to use its mathematical concepts for damage
phenomena. To emphasize this, the abbreviation ‘mathematical formalism of equilibrium
statistical mechanics (FESM)’ will be used when the mathematical formalism of ESM
(but not ESM itself) will be directly applicable.
In section 2 we introduce a model which we will use to illustrate all discussed concepts.
In the same section we discuss how the stochasticity of this model could be mapped on
an SC like temperature of an external medium in the canonical ensemble. In section 3 we
introduce deﬁnitions of a microstate and a macrostate. Also the concept of ‘stochastic’
equilibrium is discussed. In section 4 we consider why ESM cannot be directly applied
to damage phenomena. Sections 5 and 6 investigate the model for the constant external
strain and constant external stress, respectively. In these sections we ﬁnd the equation
of state and illustrate how the FESM could be applied to the model. Also for the case
of the constant external stress we ﬁnd the presence of the phase transition in the system.
We classify this phase transition as a ﬁrst-order phase transition with a spinodal point.
However, we also ﬁnd that this spinodal exhibits properties similar to critical. Section 7
is the main section of the paper. Here we compare the mathematical formalism of the
microcanonical and canonical ensembles in ESM with the stochasticity of the damage
model. This comparison maps topological properties of damage on the main concepts of
ESM like temperature, entropy and the energy-balance equation. We investigate what
quantity could play the role of the free energy potential. Also in section 7 we ﬁnd that
the classiﬁcation of phase transitions used in the literature signiﬁcantly depends on the
choice of the free energy potential. Another result of section 7 is that, for the case of
constant external stress, the model exhibits non-Gibbsian behavior which indicates that
even the FESM becomes incompletely applicable. We have the same sharp maximum of
the probability of macrostates but, in contrast to the case of constant strain, we are not
able to describe the system by a temperature parameter.
2. Model
Damage is a complex phenomenon. It can be associated with local and non-local load
sharing, brittle and ductile behavior. It can emerge both in one-dimensional and three-

Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
dimensional systems, leading in the last case to three-dimensional stress patterns of crack
formation. The basic principles of damage are often completely disguised by the secondary
side eﬀects of its appearance.
Therefore, to develop the theory of damage as an ESM phenomenon, it is reasonable
to consider initially a simple model. So, in ESM the van der Waals’ mean-ﬁeld model
is usually used to illustrate the behavior of gas–liquid systems. In the case of magnetic
systems an analogy is the mean-ﬁeld Ising model with the inﬁnite range of interactions.
The basic principles of ESM and phase-transition behavior can be illustrated by these
simple models. Further models corresponding to real systems can be constructed as more
accurate and more complex improvements.
In this paper we will investigate the mean-ﬁeld approximation of damage phenomena.
As a model we consider a static (deterministic, quenched) ﬁber-bundle model (further
ﬁber-bundle model (FBM)) with the uniform global (mean-ﬁeld) load sharing. The term
‘static’ as opposed to the term ‘stochastic’ is used to specify that each ﬁber has an a priori
assigned strength threshold s which does not change during the model evolution, and this
ﬁber can fail only when its stress σF exceeds its strength s. All ﬁbers have predeﬁned
strengths, distributed with an a priori speciﬁed probability density function ps(s). The
cumulative distribution function Ps(σF) =
 σF
0
ps(s) ds is the probability for a ﬁber to
have been already broken if its stress is supposed to be σF.
We assume that there is an ensemble of identical systems.
The systems are non-
thermodynamic and thermal ﬂuctuations are naturally absent in them.
Instead, each
system in the ensemble realizes some strength distribution over its ﬁbers. Each system
in the ensemble fails in its own way.
This particular system does not exhibit any
variability because the way it fails is prescribed for it in advance and forever. However,
diﬀerent systems in the ensemble fail in diﬀerent ways.
This introduces stochastic
topological ﬂuctuations. The prescribed distribution Ps(s) works as an SC introduced
into the ensemble as a model input. This SC is similar to the temperature prescribed
in the canonical ensemble. The external medium dictates the equilibrium distribution
of probabilities for the stochastic behavior but the system actually can realize itself in a
non-equilibrium state with any other probability distribution (i.e. it can ﬂuctuate from
the prescribed distribution Ps(s)).
For example, in the thermal canonical ensemble a
system can consume any amount of energy and only the equilibrium value is prescribed
by the temperature. Similarly, we assume that a system in the ensemble can realize an
arbitrary distribution of ﬁber strengths and realizes Ps(s) only when the ensemble is in
equilibrium with the SC (further equilibrium (i.e. being consistent) with the external
stochastic constraint (EwSC)). The model is deterministic (static) in the sense that for
each particular system the realization of strength distribution is assigned a priori and
does not change during the system evolution.
Therefore for the same realization of
strength distribution the system follows during its evolution exactly the same deterministic
trajectory. However, the model is stochastic in the sense that an a priori assigned sample
distribution of a system is prescribed stochastically and only on the ensemble average
should correspond to Ps(s).
We assume that the number of ﬁbers in the model N is constant and inﬁnite in the
thermodynamic limit. Intact ﬁbers all carry the same strain εF which is identically equal
to the strain ε of the total model as a ‘black box’: εF ≡ε. The stress of each intact ﬁber
is assumed to have a linear elastic dependence on the strain until ﬁber failure: σF = EεF,

4J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P09005
Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
where E is the Young’s modulus, which is assumed to be the same for all ﬁbers. This
introduces the concept of nonlinear stress–strain dependence for the total model although
each ﬁber behaves elastically till its failure.
Order parameters in gas–liquid systems are densities of phases; in magnetic systems
they are magnetizations of phases. Similar to the ESM approach we deﬁne diﬀerent phases
of damage as phases with diﬀerent fractions of broken ﬁbers. To do so it is necessary to
introduce the damage parameter D as the fraction of broken ﬁbers. If the total number of
ﬁbers in the model is N then the number of broken ﬁbers is DN and the number of intact
ﬁbers is (1 −D)N. The damage parameter D plays here the role of the order parameter
distinguishing phases.
For all possible states of the system (equilibrium or not) we will assume that the
total external force acting on the system is balanced by the response force of all ﬁbers—
transient processes with the discontinuity of the boundary force are not considered in this
paper. Then if we, as an external observer, were to look at the model as at a ‘black
box’ we would not to know how many ﬁbers are broken inside and we would see that the
external force F is applied to N ﬁbers, creating a uniform ‘virtual’ stress σ at the model
surface. The actual stress in ﬁbers is 1/(1 −D) times higher due to the ﬁber failure and
stress redistribution. Therefore, the virtual stress of the model (how an external observer
sees it) is σ = (1 −D)σF or
σ = (1 −D)Eε.
(1)
It is important to note here that this ‘geometric’ constraint is so strong that it acts not
only on the level of equilibrium quantities but even on the level of each microstate (each
realization of strength distribution). This signiﬁcantly changes the behavior of the model
in contrast to gas–liquid systems. One important consequence, as we will see below, is that
the Gibbs energy is not a free energy potential for the case of constant stress (pressure)
of the system.
Under the condition of a ﬁxed number of particles liquid–gas/magnetic systems have
two ﬁeld parameters outside of the coexistence region: these could be temperature and
volume/magnetization, or temperature and pressure/magnetic ﬁeld, or any other pair of
independent variables. In the case of the FBM strain ε or stress σ could be chosen to be
a ﬁeld parameter. However, in contrast to other systems, only one of these parameters is
independent. ‘Geometric’ constraint (1) and an equation of state make two of the three
parameters D, ε and σ dependent. Therefore we would initially expect that an analogue
of the energy-balance equation for the FBM must have one term less.
In ESM a system has a phase space of microstates along which it wanders, jumping
from one microstate to another in accordance with the assigned probabilities of each
microstate. In general, the system can reach any microstate of all those possible, and only
a long waiting time makes non-equilibrium states unobservable. Another formulation is
a concept of the ensemble of identical systems. An observer can simultaneously watch
diﬀerent microstates as realizations of diﬀerent copies of the initial system. An ergodic
hypothesis claims that these two diﬀerent approaches are equivalent: in the ensemble at
a given time the observer sees each state realized with the same probability as it would
be in the case of observations of only one system for a long time.
However, in the case of the FBM without healing (which is under consideration) we
have only one possibility—an ensemble of identical systems. Each realization of the model

5J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P09005
Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
has an a priori prescribed strength distribution which does not change during the system
evolution. Therefore, for the given value of constant strain or stress the system has failed
in one particular way (microstate) and will never visit other microstates. So, only the
ensemble analogy with ESM is possible for our FBM.
3. Deﬁnition of a microstate, macrostate and equilibrium state
In the case of gas–liquid systems microstates are deﬁned as cells in the phase space of a
system. In the case of magnetic systems microstates are deﬁned as diﬀerent realizations
of ‘up’ and ‘down’ spins on a lattice: ↑↑↓↓↑. We can deﬁne microstates for the FBM in an
analogous way as diﬀerent realizations of broken and intact ﬁbers. So, for the FBM with
N = 3 ﬁbers all possible microstates are |||, ||×, | × |, ×||, | × ×, ×|×, × × | and × × ×
where the symbol ‘|’ denotes an intact ﬁber while the symbol ‘×’ denotes a broken ﬁber.
Further in the paper the index n will be used to enumerate all possible microstates.
For the speciﬁed damage D and for the external boundary constraints (further
external boundary constraint (e.g. constant volume or pressure prescribed to the system)
(BC)) ε = const or σ = const each microstate has probability
wequil
n
(D) ≡wequil(D) = (1 −Ps(Eε))(1−D)N (Ps(Eε))DN

for σ = const
(2b)
as the probability that (1 −D)N ﬁbers are intact and DN ﬁbers are broken.
This
probability wequil
n
is dictated by the SC Ps(s). Again, this SC is similar to the temperature
prescribed in the canonical ensemble.
An external medium dictates the equilibrium
distribution of probabilities but the system actually can realize itself in a non-equilibrium
state with any other probability distribution wn. Only the equilibrium state is dictated by
the SC; therefore we used the term ‘equil’ to emphasize that this probability distribution
corresponds to the EwSC.
In general, a macrostate may be deﬁned as a union of all possible microstates realized
with the speciﬁed probabilities. However, in this paper a simpler deﬁnition will be used
when these probabilities equal only zero or unity. In other words, later in this paper as to
a macrostate we will refer to a subset of microstates chosen by a particular property. For
example, the deﬁnition of a macrostate in the thermal canonical ensemble is a subset of all
microstates with the speciﬁed energy. For the FBM we will presumably use the deﬁnition
of a macrostate as a subset of all microstates with the speciﬁed fraction of broken ﬁbers,
i.e. with the speciﬁed damage D. If another deﬁnition of a macrostate shall be utilized it
will be clearly speciﬁed.
All microstates corresponding to the macrostate D have the same probability (2) and
the number of these microstates is given by the combinatorial choice of DN broken ﬁbers
among N ﬁbers

DDN(1 −D)(1−D)N
(3)
where the term ‘≈ln’ means that, in the thermodynamic limit N →+∞, all power-
law multipliers are neglected in comparison with the exponential dependence on N.

6J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P09005
Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
Everywhere else, the term ‘≈ln’ will mean the accuracy of the exponential dependence
neglecting all power-law dependences. For the logarithm of such equations we will use the
symbol ‘≈’.
To ﬁnd the total probability of the macrostate D we need to multiply the probability
of each microstate (2) by the total number of microstates (3) corresponding to this
macrostate:

(4b)
for the BC σ = const. This is the probability for the macrostate D to be observed in the
EwSC.
We used above the term ‘equilibrium’ but did not specify what we refer to by this term.
The wrong way would be to imagine a time-dependent system in some detailed balance
with the SC. There is no time dependence in the model. Each system fails only once
in an a priori prescribed way. Actually, this particular system is only one microstate.
By the term ‘equilibrium’ we refer to the ensemble of failed systems whose properties
on average correspond to the prescribed SC. In fact, it could be named ‘consistency’
with the SC. However, all further results will be based on the application of the FESM.
And this ‘consistency’ will be mapped on the property that is called ‘equilibrium’ in
ESM. Therefore, we will continue to use the term ‘stochastic equilibrium’ or, simpler,
‘equilibrium’ in this paper. However, again, it would be wrong to associate this ‘stochastic
equilibrium’ with the classical understanding of the thermodynamic equilibrium as the
detailed balance with a medium. The term ‘stochastic equilibrium’ does not say anything
about a particular system or detailed balance and prescribes only the averaged statistical
properties of the ensemble.
For ‘stochastic equilibrium’ we will use two diﬀerent deﬁnitions which are often
confused in the literature. The SC is assumed to prescribe the equilibrium probability
distribution wequil
n
for all microstates.
Therefore, the EwSC could be identiﬁed with
a system which can realize itself on all microstates with equilibrium probabilities:
wn = wequil
n
.
In other words, all microstates are possible but their probabilities are
dictated by the SC. As for an example we could think of the equilibrium in the
thermal canonical ensemble where all microstates with all energies are possible but their
probabilities are dictated by a Boltzmann distribution. The superscript ‘equil’ will be
used for this deﬁnition. Then the value of any quantity f in the EwSC by deﬁnition is
f equil ≡
n wequil
n
fn.
In contrast, another deﬁnition is the equilibrium (most probable) macrostate, i.e.
a system that can realize itself only on (that is isolated on) a subset of microstates
corresponding to the most probable macrostate.
This is the macrostate which gives
the main contribution to the partition function. As an example we could think of the

equilibrium macrostate of the thermal canonical ensemble where we count only those
microstates whose energies are equal to the equilibrium value E0 = NkBT/2.
To
distinguish this case the subscript ‘0’ will be used.
4. Why we cannot directly apply the ESM formalism
Our FBM is not a thermal system and it has topological ﬂuctuations instead of thermal
ﬂuctuations.
Temperature is naturally absent in this system.
Also there is no time
dependence in our model. The direct application of ESM requires a system with both
thermal ﬂuctuations and the presence of thermodynamic equilibrium (of detailed balance).
The presence of thermal ﬂuctuations and detailed balance assumes that each system in
the ensemble is not ‘frozen’ like our model but is ﬂuctuating and time-dependent. In
contrast, our model has only the ensemble ﬂuctuations and therefore the methods of ESM
cannot be applied directly and have to be developed independently.
For example, under constant stress and constant temperature conditions it would
not be correct to say that the free energy potential of the system (whose minimization
gives an equilibrium state) is the Gibbs free energy G deﬁned in the traditional way
G = E −TS −V σε where E is the energy of the system.
The FBM does not have
temperature or an energy-balance equation. Therefore ESM is not applicable here directly.
Another incorrect method would be the minimization of entropy as is done in ESM.
One of the deﬁnitions of entropy is given by
S ≡−⟨ln wn⟩≡−

n
wn ln wn
(5)
where wn is the probability of microstate n and the sum is over all microstates (here
and in the following the Boltzmann constant is omitted from the formulae of ESM and is
absent naturally in the FBM’s formulae). For the FBM this formula can be rewritten as
S = −

D
Nmacro
D
w(D) lnw(D)
(6)
where we have accumulated the summation over all microstates corresponding to the
speciﬁed D by the number of these microstates Nmacro
D
due to the fact that all these
microstates have equal probabilities w(D) given by equation (2).
For the microcanonical ensemble (an isolated system with g microstates) the negative
entropy is the free energy potential and an equilibrium state can be found by the
maximization of entropy over all possible values of microstate probabilities wn.
The
method of Lagrange multipliers is used with the single BC prescribed for the system that
the sum of probabilities of all microstates must be equal to unity: g
n=1 wn = 1. Then
the maximization gives equal probabilities wequil
n
= 1/g for all microstates.
For the canonical ensemble a correct equilibrium state is usually found by adding an
additional BC: the mean energy must be equal to the energy dictated by the medium:

n Enwn = E0. It should be noted, however, that this condition is irrelevant for the
canonical ensemble (because nothing restricts the system to consume any energy) and
is in situ only an artiﬁcial trick to obtain the result by the maximization of entropy.
With this trick the maximization of entropy gives the correct Gibbs distribution wequil
n
.
However, a better way to obtain this result would be to say that, for the canonical ensemble
doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2008/09/P09005
8J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P09005
Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
(constant temperature and constant volume), the free energy potential is not the entropy
but the Helmholtz energy A = E −TS = 
n Enwn+T 
n wn ln wn. Minimization of this
quantity by the method of Lagrange multipliers with the single relevant to the canonical
ensemble BC 
n wn = 1 (without artiﬁcially introduced BC 
n Enwn = E0) gives the
correct result—the Gibbs distribution wequil
n
(see, e.g., [13]).
For the FBM this method must not be used because the maximization of microstate
probabilities wn must include the SC Ps(s) as an additional BC. In other words, we
must minimize the free energy over probabilities wn with the constraints wn ≡wequil
n
,
where wequil
n
is given by equation (2). Therefore, there is no variability for wn and such
maximization would not have any sense.
So, ESM cannot be applied directly to our model. However, as we will see below, we
are still able to use the FESM. But now this formalism should be developed from ﬁrst
principles. This will give us a step-by-step mapping of the mathematical structures of
ESM on the stochastic properties of our model.
5. Equation of state for the BC of constant strain ε = const
W equil
macro D(D) = Nmacro
D
wequil(D) is the probability distribution of macrostates in EwSC.
To obtain the averaged values of measurable quantities in this state it is necessary to
maximize W equil
macro D(D) over all possible values of D: 0 ≤D ≤1. Both functions Nmacro
D
and wequil(D) depend exponentially on N which is inﬁnite in the thermodynamic limit.
Therefore these functions have very rapid change with the change of D and the maximum
of W equil
macro D(D) is very sharp (FESM). To ﬁnd the maximum it is necessary to ﬁnd when
derivatives (dW equil
macro D/dD)(D) or (d ln W equil
macro D/dD)(D) are equal to zero. After simple
algebra we obtain that the equilibrium value of D0 for the given ε is
D0 = Ps(Eε)
(7)
as could be expected because the equilibrium damage must be determined by the number
of failed ﬁbers. An example of the dependence of W equil
macro D(D) on D and the maximum
D0 are given in ﬁgure 4(a) for N = 100. Equation (7) is the equation of the equilibrium
state, in contrast to equation (1) which could be called an equation of the ‘geometric’
constraint.
It is easy to ﬁnd that the second derivative of the function ln W equil
macro D(D) at the
maximum (7) equals (−N)/(Ps(Eε)(1 −Ps(Eε))). The second derivative is negative and
therefore the obtained extremum is indeed a maximum. Also, because the maximum is
very narrow, we can approximate its curvature by the parabolic descent and ﬁnd that the
width of the maximum is of the order of
δD ∝

Ps(Eε)(1 −Ps(Eε))
N
.
(8)
Fluctuations of D in EwSC are of the order of the width of the maximum and therefore
relative ﬂuctuations are inversely proportional to the square root of the number of
ﬁbers N: (δD/Dequil) ∝(1/
√
N). Indeed, the logarithm of the probability W equil
macro D(D)
of ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the maximum can be approximated by the parabolic
dependence:

and
ﬂuctuations
are
distributed
in

with
the
Gaussian
distribution.
Standard deviation of this distribution is inversely proportional to the square root
of N and, indeed for the relative ﬂuctuations (FESM), we have

⟨ΔD2⟩/⟨D⟩∝

(1 −Ps(Eε))/(Ps(Eε))(1/
√
N).
So, the relative ﬂuctuations of D are inversely
proportional to the square root of the number of ﬁbers N (N is inﬁnite in the
thermodynamic limit). Therefore the maximum is indeed very narrow.
Ideally, to obtain any quantity in equilibrium, we must average it over all microstates:
f equil ≡
n wequil
n
fn = 
D Nmacro
D
wequil(D)f(D). The fact that the maximum is very
narrow gives us a possibility (FESM) to calculate all quantities averaged over D as their
values at the point of the maximum: f equil ≈f(D0). For example, the averaged damage
parameter in the equilibrium equals its value at the maximum: Dequil ≈D0.
Is it possible for ﬂuctuations to overwhelm the damping factor 1/
√
N and to stop to
be Gaussian? This would be an indication of the presence of a critical or spinodal point.
The formula

⟨ΔD2⟩/⟨D⟩∝

D0 = 0. Similarly, for the fraction of intact ﬁbers L ≡1 −D the relative ﬂuctuation

⟨ΔL2⟩/⟨L⟩∝

D0/(1 −D0)(1/
√
N) contains the opposite trivial singularity D0 = 1.
The absence of non-trivial singularities suggests that the system under the BC of constant
strain does not have a phase transition and ﬂuctuations are always Gaussian. As we will
see later this statement is not valid for the BC of constant stress.

We have obtained the fundamental result (FESM): the deﬁnition of entropy as the
negative logarithm of microstate probability averaged over all microstates S ≡−⟨ln wn⟩
is equivalent to another deﬁnition of the entropy as the logarithm of the number of
microstates over which the system presumably realizes itself.

It should be noted that the entropy given by equations (9)–(10) and (12)–(13) is
the statistical, topological entropy and must not be confused with the thermodynamic
entropy. In the literature it is often done to multiply equation (12) by the Boltzmann
constant kB and to use this quantity in the energy-balance equation as the thermodynamic
entropy.
The incorrectness of this approach can be easily illustrated by the following
example. Let us assume that only one ﬁber is broken. In this case the entropy given by
equation (12) and multiplied by kB is S ≈kB ln N. If the number of ﬁbers is high but
ﬁnite, e.g. N = e10, the product of the entropy and temperature TS is of the order of
the energy of 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, the surface energy and elastic energy of
the broken ﬁber as a macroscopic object are of the order of the Avogadro constant (1023
times higher). Therefore, it is irrelevant to use the obtained expression of entropy in the
energy-balance equation because the entropy given by equation (12) does not represent
the thermodynamic entropy. Instead, a new, ‘topological’ analogue of the energy-balance
equation must be constructed as we will see below.
6. Equation of state for the BC of constant stress σ = const
Let us ﬁrst consider a simple example.
For the BC of constant strain we had σ =
(1 −D0)Eε = (1 −Ps(Eε))Eε for the virtual stress at the model boundary. Its derivative
is dσ/dε = −E2εps(Eε) + E(1 −Ps(Eε)). The value of ε at which the derivative dσ/dε
equals zero is a fracture point that separates regions of stable and unstable equilibria for
the BC σ = const. For the BC ε = const of course both regions are stable.
As an example let us obtain a solution for the uniform strength distribution
ps(s) =
⎧

⎩
0,
s < s1
s −s1
s2 −s1
,
s1 < s < s2
1,
s2 < s
.
The equation of state can be easily obtained. For any values of parameters s1 and s2 the
virtual stress σ has a linear dependence on strain ε in the range 0 < Eε < s1. This is the
elastic behavior of the model till the ﬁrst ﬁber failure. If s2 ≤2s1 then after the strain ε
exceeds the value s1/E the stress monotonically decreases with the further increase of the
strain. The instability condition dσ/dε < 0 means that, for the BC of constant stress, the
non-elastic branch of the stress curve is always unstable and a complete rupture follows
the ﬁrst ﬁber failure.
However, if s2 > 2s1 then the stress with the further increase
of strain increasing initially comes to the point where dσ/dε = 0, and then decreases
monotonically. This means that the initial part of the non-elastic curve is stable while
its continuation after the point dσ/dε = 0 is unstable and causes complete rupture. The
behavior of the model is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1. The equation of state as the stress–strain dependence. Three curves
illustrate the dependence for diﬀerent ratios of s2/2s1.
Figure 2. Two solutions A and B for diﬀerent ratios of s2/2s1.
The point dσ/dε = 0 is a fracture point S of the model for the BC σ = const (see
ﬁgure 3). For any values of model parameters each possible value of the virtual stress σ
has two strain solutions εA and εB (and, respectively, two damage solutions DA and DB)
as is shown in ﬁgure 2. However, in the case of constant strain equation (7) has only one
solution as the direct dependence of D on ε (DA corresponds to εA and DB corresponds
to εB) and for any value of constant strain the probability W equil
macro D(D) has only one
extremum (a maximum). For N = 100 and ε = const an example of the dependence of
W equil
macro D(D) on D is given in ﬁgure 4(a).

for the equilibrium state. However, now two diﬀerent values of the damage parameter
(DA and DB in ﬁgure 2) correspond to equation (15) for any value of the constant
external stress. Therefore the dependence W equil
macro D(D) has two equal local maxima as
is shown in ﬁgure 4(b) for the example above. Also there is a third, non-trivial solution
for equation (14) which, however, does not give a maximum of W equil
macro D(D) but a minimum
between two maxima (15).
The fourth solution is a point F (ﬁgure 3) of a complete fracture DF = 1. Indeed,
for this case we have Nmacro
DF

≡1 and
W equil
macro DF(DF) = 1. All four extremum values of D are given in ﬁgure 4(b).
The behavior of ﬂuctuations in this case requires more careful investigation.

Indeed, this expression has a singularity when dD0/dσ = ∞or
dσ/dD0 = 0. Remembering that Eε = σ/(1 −D0), for the point of singularity we obtain
dσ/dε = 0.
This corresponds to point S in ﬁgure 3 and, as was suggested by many
authors [7, 9, 14], it is in situ a spinodal point of the model. As the constant external
stress σ approaches this point σ|S the minimum of W equil
macro D(D) between two solutions (15)
becomes shallower and at point S two maxima of W equil

Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
The typical behavior of W equil
macro D(D) for this case is given in ﬁgure 4(c). The ﬂuctuations
are no longer Gaussian and the relative ﬂuctuations become proportional to 1/
4√
N. This
behavior is typical for the spinodal point in the mean-ﬁeld Landau theory (FESM)
and its applicability to the FBM seems to be natural because the model we discuss
is the mean-ﬁeld model.
For the case of an FBM with the local stress redistribution
in the vicinity of point S the size of ﬂuctuations in the system would have power-
law divergence which would correspond to the inﬁnite correlation length (FESM).
Therefore, under the BC of the constant stress the system has a spinodal point
and the damage in the system exhibits properties of the ﬁrst-order phase transition
A →B →F.
We have found three independent equilibrium values of damage parameter DA,
DB and DF for the dependence W equil
macro D(D).
And, in accordance with our solution,
all three values should be stable.
However, we know that the equilibrium DA is in
situ metastable and that the equilibrium DB is in situ unstable because dσ/dε < 0
there. It is again in complete analogy with the van der Waals’ mean-ﬁeld model for the
gas–liquid system.
The exact solution of the homogeneous mean-ﬁeld van der Waals’
model also gives the metastable and unstable branches of the isothermal pressure–volume
dependence. The reason is that the constructed model is a priori homogeneous. Only the
introduction of Maxwell’s rule for heterogeneous liquid–gas transitions allows substituting
the unstable branch by the stable coexistence of two phases.
The case of the FBM
is similar.
Our model is an a priori mean-ﬁeld homogeneous model.
Therefore its
exact solution exhibits the presence of the unstable branch. Only the introduction of
heterogeneity into the system would allow substituting this branch by the stable Maxwell
solution. If we were to imagine a heterogeneous FBM with local range of stress transfer
we would have a heterogeneous mixture of intact and broken states A and F. It is
illustrated in ﬁgure 3. Curve 0–S is metastable, curve S–B–G is unstable and Maxwell’s
rule is given by the straight line A–B–F. Here point F represents the inﬁnity of the
strain; therefore actually curve A–B–F should be thought of as a horizontal line to
inﬁnity.
So, we have found that under the BC of constant stress the FBM exhibits the presence
of the ﬁrst-order phase transition and the spinodal. However, as will be shown later,
the classiﬁcation of phase transitions is controversial because the continuity of the free
energy potential strongly depends on the choice of the free energy potential itself. Some
potentials, although they acquire a minimum at equilibrium, can be continuous even in
the case of the ﬁrst-order phase transitions. This will be illustrated by equation (24) in
the next paragraph.
Also it should be noted that the spinodal in our model exhibits properties similar
to critical. In the classical theory of spinodal phenomena one maximum of W equil
macro D(D)
is local and therefore the probability W equil
macro D(D) for this maximum is much smaller
than for the global maximum.
Figure 4(b) exhibits a completely diﬀerent behavior
for our case—both maxima are equal.
It is easy to check this analytically.
Indeed,
substituting equation (15) into equation (4b) we immediately obtain that for both maxima
the probability W equil
macro D(D) equals unity.
Therefore the spinodal point for damage
phenomena has much in common with the classic theory of critical point phenomena.
It could be reasonable to call point S the critical point if only the solution DB would not
be unstable.

7. Temperature and free energy potential
To construct the free energy potential it is necessary to discuss ﬁrst the derivation of the
free energy potential in ESM. First we consider a thermodynamic system isolated with
the given energy E. In the energy spectrum of the system some g(E) degenerated levels
correspond to this value of energy E. As for degenerated levels we will, for simplicity,
refer to the groups of levels with close values of energies. For the case of an ideal system
without interactions it is possible to think of the exact degeneracy in the sense of quantum
mechanics.
So, only g(E) microstates are possible for the isolated system.
The equilibrium
probability of each microstate is wequil
n
= 1/g(E). The entropy of the system in equilibrium
is
Sequil ≡−
g(E)

n=1
wequil
n
ln wequil
n
= −g(E)
1
g(E) ln
1
g(E) = ln g(E).
(19)
Here g(E) is the number of microstates ΔΓ over which the system can realize itself with
non-zero probability and Sequil = ln ΔΓ.
For the isolated system we have to use another deﬁnition of a macrostate: we deﬁne
a non-equilibrium macrostate as a system that can realize itself only on a subset Δg of
all possible g(E) microstates: Δg ⊂g(E). Then the probability of each microstate for
this macrostate is wn = 1/Δg. There is already no superscript ‘equil’ in the probability
here because this probability is not in equilibrium with the BC E = const. The entropy
of the macrostate is Smacro
Δg
≡−Δg
n=1 wn ln wn = −Δg(1/Δg) ln (1/Δg) = ln Δg. The
probability of this macrostate in the system isolated with E (the probability to occur
in equilibrium with the BC E = const) is W equil
macro Δg = Δg · wequil
n
= Δg/g(E). This
probability is in situ the free energy potential that should be maximized. The maximum of
W equil
macro Δg corresponds to the equilibrium macrostate that occupies all possible microstates:
Δg0 = g(E).
The entropy of this macrostate equals the entropy of the system at
equilibrium: Smacro
Δg0=g(E) = ln g(E) = Sequil.
Instead of the actual free energy potential W equil
macro Δg that should be maximized
we can construct a potential that should be minimized.
One of the possible choices
is ΦΔg = −ln W equil
macro Δg because the minus logarithm is a monotonically decreasing
function.
This deﬁned potential identically equals zero at the equilibrium macrostate
Δg0 = g(E) as W equil
macro Δg0=g(E) = 1. Another possible choice is ΦΔg = −ln(g(E)W equil
macro Δg)
because g(E) is a constant which does not inﬂuence the behavior of the potential. Now
ΦΔg = −ln Δg = −Smacro
Δg
.
Therefore the negative entropy of the non-equilibrium
macrostates plays the role of the free energy potential that should be minimized for the
isolated system.
For the FBM, instead of a system isolated with energy E we can imagine a system
isolated with the particular damage D. This system can realize only Nmacro

For the non-equilibrium macrostate ΔN we have to use here an alternative deﬁnition,
diﬀerent from that used in section 3. The non-equilibrium macrostate ΔN is deﬁned as a
macrostate when the system with probabilities wn = 1/ΔN can realize itself only on the
ΔN of all possible Nmacro

as ΦΔN = −ln W equil
macro ΔN or ΦΔN = −ln(Nmacro
D
W equil
macro ΔN) = −ln ΔN = −Smacro
ΔN
. Again,
the negative entropy of the non-equilibrium macrostates can be chosen as the free energy
potential.
Of course, our systems are non-Hamiltonian and the concept of energy is not
applicable to them.
Therefore we would suggest in future to use the term ‘ruling’ or
‘governing’ potential instead of ‘free energy’ potential. Or, being consistent with Sinai–
Bowen–Ruelle’s terminology [13, 15, 16], the term ‘topological’ or ‘stochastic’ potential
could be used. However, to be consistent the term ‘free energy’ potential will be used till
the end of this paper.
The phenomenological approach for an isolated system claims that the entropy of the
isolated system can only increase: dS/dt ≥0. We see that it corresponds to the fact
that, on its way to equilibrium, the system prefers macrostates with higher probability
W equil
macro ΔN (with higher ΔN):

(20)
Now we consider the case of the canonical ensemble in ESM (N = const, V = const,
T = const). In the canonical ensemble the temperature of the external medium as an
SC dictates to the system the equilibrium energy E0 and the equilibrium probability of
microstates:
wequil
n
≡wequil(E) = 1

E g(E)wequil(E) ln wequil(E),
where the sum over microstates has been substituted by the sum over the values of energy

we obtain
Sequil = −

Deﬁning the Helmholtz energy A as A ≡E −TS (both for equilibrium and non-
equilibrium states) we obtain Aequil = Eequil −TSequil = −T ln z.
So, the Helmholtz
energy equals −T ln z only for equilibrium states. The equilibrium probability (21) is
wequil
n

Applicability and non-applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics
We can deﬁne a non-equilibrium macrostate as a subset of all microstates
corresponding to the given energy E (i.e. as a system isolated with E). The number
of these microstates is g(E) and their probabilities are w(E) = 1/g(E) (for the system
is constrained by this macrostate, i.e. isolated with the given E). The entropy of this
macrostate is
Smacro
E
= −g(E)
1
g(E) ln
1
g(E) = ln g(E)
(23)
and the probability of this macrostate in the canonical ensemble (to occur in EwSC
T = const) is W equil
macro E(E) = g(E)wequil(E) = g(E)e(Aequil−E)/T. This very probability
function W equil
macro E(E) is the free energy potential that should be maximized. Also we can
deﬁne the free energy potential that has to be minimized as Φ(E) = −ln W equil
macro E(E).
The maximum of W equil
macro E(E) is very narrow and the number of energy levels ΔΓ in its
width is of the order of the degeneration of one of them g(E0) (again neglecting power-law
dependences on N in comparison with the exponential dependence of g(E)). But the area
under the function W equil
macro E(E) has to accumulate its unity value under the maximum.
Therefore we can conclude that at the maximum g(E0) ≈ln 1/wequil(E0), where E0 is the
equilibrium value of energy at the maximum. Therefore at the equilibrium macrostate
Φ(E0) = −ln W equil
macro E0(E0) = −ln g(E0)wequil(E0) ≈ln 0.
(24)
For any equilibrium state this potential identically equals zero. Therefore its derivatives
over the equilibrium changes are also equal to zero identically. Next we will introduce
another free energy potential whose derivatives could be non-zero. Therefore the criterion
to distinguish ﬁrst and continuous phase transitions strongly depends on the choice of the
free energy potential.
Also we can deﬁne the free energy potential that has to be minimized as Φ(E) =
−λ1 ln(W equil
macro E(E)λ2), where λ1 and λ2 are some positive constants.
Choosing these
constants to be λ1 = T and λ2 = z we obtain
Φ(E) = −T ln W equil

(25)
where zmacro
E
≡
n:En=E e−(En/T) = g(E)e−(E/T) is the partial partition function only over
microstates corresponding to the given macrostate E.
The free energy potential (25)
corresponds to the Helmholtz energy for equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. While
potential (24) is identically equal to zero for any equilibrium state and therefore its
equilibrium derivatives are also zero, the Helmholtz energy (25) could have complex
behavior of its derivatives that characterizes the order of the possible phase transition
in the system.
Therefore the classiﬁcation of orders of phase transitions signiﬁcantly
depends on the choice of the free energy potential.
The maximum is very narrow and ln wequil(E) is a slowly changing function with a
power-law dependence on N in comparison with g(E) and wequil(E) with the exponential
dependence on N. Therefore for the entropy of the system in equilibrium we have

/dE)|E0 ≈dSequil/dE0.
This is the energy-balance equation
dE0 = TdSequil. For non-equilibrium states instead, the increment of energy equals the
amount of heat received by the system dE = δQ←where, in general, δQ←< TdS.
Imagine now a system in the canonical ensemble during its evolution over non-
equilibrium macrostates E on its way to the equilibrium. Each macrostate E could be
thought of as a system isolated with the energy E. Therefore, the increase of the entropy
in the system in accordance with equation (20) must be higher than the increase of the
entropy produced only by the change of macrostates (23):
dSmacro
ΔN(E) ≥dSmacro
E
= d ln g(E).
(28)
In the vicinity of the maximum of W equil
macro E(E) we have equation (27) and dS ≥d ln g(E) =
dE/T or
dA ≡d(E −TS) = dE −TdS ≤0.
(29)
Therefore, we have conﬁrmed that the Helmholtz energy is the free energy potential in
the case of the canonical ensemble.
The behavior of the FBM under the BC ε = const is analogous to the behavior of the
canonical ensemble and the damage parameter D plays the role of the energy E. Indeed,
the equilibrium probability of microstates assigned a priori by equation (2a) equals
wequil(D) = exp ((1 −D)N ln (1 −Ps(Eε)) + DN ln (Ps(Eε))) = 1
ze−(DN/T)
(30)
where z = (1 −Ps(Eε))−N. It is easy to verify that z is again the partition function of
the system z = 
D Nmacro
D
e−(DN/T). The role of the temperature T prescribed by the SC
Ps(Eε) is played by the quantity
T = ln−1 1 −Ps(Eε)
Ps(Eε)
.
(31)
The temperature here is a constant for the external constraint ε = const and therefore
could be used as a BC too. Actually, two BCs ε = const or T = const are equivalent and
could be used intermittently.
Of course,
the term ‘temperature’ here has nothing to do with the energy
characteristics of the system and reﬂects only the similarity of mathematics with ESM.
Therefore we would suggest calling it ‘topological’ temperature.

Deﬁning the Helmholtz energy A as A ≡DN −TS we obtain Aequil = DequilN −TSequil =
−T ln z. Therefore the Helmholtz energy equals −T ln z only for the equilibrium states.
Then the equilibrium probability (30) is wequil(D) = e(Aequil−DN)/T.
We can deﬁne a non-equilibrium macrostate as a subset of all microstates
corresponding to the given damage D (i.e. as a system isolated with D). The number of
these microstates is Nmacro

and their probabilities are w(D) = 1/Nmacro

and the probability for this macrostate in EwSC is W equil

D
e(Aequil−DN)/T.
This very probability function W equil
macro D(D) is the free energy
potential that should be maximized. Also we can deﬁne the free energy potential that
has to be minimized as Φ(D) = −ln W equil
macro D(D).
The maximum of W equil
macro D(D) is
very narrow, while the number ΔΓ of microstates in its range is of the order of the
number of microstates Nmacro
D0
corresponding to one particular D in this range (again
neglecting power-law dependences on N in comparison with the exponential dependence
of Nmacro
D
). But the area under the function W equil
macro D(D) has to accumulate its unity
value under the maximum. Therefore we can conclude that at the maximum Nmacro
D0
≈ln
1/wequil(D0), where D0 is the equilibrium value of damage given by equation (7). Also
this result could be veriﬁed directly. Therefore at the equilibrium macrostate Φ(D0) =
−ln W equil
macro D0(D0) = −ln Nmacro
D0
wequil(D0) ≈0.
Also we can deﬁne the free energy potential that has to be minimized as Φ(D) =
−λ1 ln(W equil
macro D(D)λ2) where λ1 and λ2 are some positive constants.
Choosing these
constants to be λ1 = T and λ2 = z we obtain
Φ(D) = −T ln W equil

e−(DN/T) is the partial partition function only

Therefore again
the entropy of the system in the equilibrium equals the entropy of the most probable

can realize itself.
At

we
have

D0 = d ln Nmacro

at the equilibrium state. This equation could be used as a deﬁnition of the temperature.
As both the entropy of a macrostate Smacro
D
= ln Nmacro
D
and the equilibrium entropy
Sequil ≈ln Nmacro
D0
have the same functional dependence on D and D0, respectively, we
obtain N/T = (dSmacro
D
/dD)|D0 ≈dSequil/dD0.
This is an analogue of the energy-
balance equation—the equation of stochastic, ‘topological’ balance NdD0 = TdSequil.
This equation could be obtained directly by the diﬀerentiating equation (33) as the
logarithm of equation (3).
For non-equilibrium states instead, the increment of entropy is dS ≥d ln Nmacro
D
=
NdD · ln ((1 −D)/D). It is easy to see that, for the equilibrium increment of entropy,
this formula gives the previous equation dSequil = NdD0 · ln ((1 −D0)/D0) = NdD0/T.
Imagine now a system in the canonical ensemble during its evolution over non-
equilibrium macrostates D on its way to equilibrium. Each macrostate D could be thought
of as a system isolated with D. Therefore the increase of the entropy in the system in
accordance with equation (20) must be higher than the increase of the entropy produced
only by the change of macrostates (33):
dSmacro
ΔN(D) ≥dSmacro

(37)
In the vicinity of the maximum of W equil
macro D(D) we have equation (36) and dS ≥
d ln Nmacro
D
= NdD/T or dA ≡d(DN −TS) = NdD −TdS ≤0.
So, we have conﬁrmed that the Helmholtz energy is the free energy potential for the
FBM under the external constraint ε = const.
The behavior of the FBM under the BC σ = const is more complex. Indeed, the
equilibrium probability of microstates is assigned a priori by equation (2b) and is

Here, however, both solutions (15) participate in the sum. Both maxima of W equil
macro D(D)
are sharp and equal unity (ﬁgure 4(b)). Therefore the participation of each of them is
proportional to the width of this maximum given by equation (17). We can introduce two

We have used here the fact that the maxima are very narrow and therefore the average
of any quantity equals the values of this quantity at the points of the maxima taken with
the corresponding proportionality coeﬃcients.
We can again deﬁne a non-equilibrium macrostate as a subset of all microstates
corresponding to the given D.
The number of these microstates is Nmacro

This very probability function W equil
macro D(D) is the free energy potential that should be
maximized.
Also we can deﬁne a free energy potential that has to be minimized as
Φ(D) = −ln W equil
macro D(D). As we have shown above, this free energy potential has two
equal minima.
The maxima of W equil
macro D(D) are very narrow and the number ΔΓ of microstates
in their ranges is of the order of the number of microstates Nmacro
D0
corresponding to one
particular D in those ranges (again neglecting power-law dependences on N in comparison
with the exponential dependence of Nmacro
D
). But the area under the function W equil
macro D(D)
has to accumulate its unity value under both maxima. Therefore we can conclude that

wequil(Di) ≈ln 1. Nothing more special can be derived for the general
case. However, for our particular model it can be veriﬁed directly from equations (2)–
(3) that at the maxima Nmacro

≈ln 1/wequil(Di) for both i = A, B. Therefore at the
equilibrium macrostate Φ(D0) = −ln W equil
macro D(D0) = −ln Nmacro
D0
wequil(D0) ≈0.
In accordance with the ESM we could expect that the free energy potential in the case
of the constant external stress σ would be the Gibbs energy. However, the temperature
deﬁned as T = ln−1 (1 −Ps(σ/(1 −D)))/Ps(σ/(1 −D)) is no longer a constant SC of
the system. This gives us a hint that the Gibbs energy is probably not the free energy
potential in this case. Indeed, the true free energy potential Φ(D) = −ln W equil

be written as

We see here the similar construction (DN/T) −Smacro
D
which is the Helmholtz energy
Amacro
D
divided by temperature T.
But in addition to this quantity we see also the
term −N ln(1 −Ps(σ/(1 −D))) which has a more complex dependence than the expected
σε ∝const/(1 −D) for the Gibbs potential. It is the result of the fact that, in the case of
the constant external stress, the behavior of the system is no longer Gibbsian and neither
ESM nor even its FESM are applicable. In contrast, the system obeys the non-Gibbsian
behavior of equation (38).
As the maxima are very narrow for the entropy of the system at equilibrium we have

The entropy of the equilibrium macrostate is Smacro
Di

Di
. The number of
microstates over which the system presumably realizes itself is ΔΓ ≈ln maxi=A,B Nmacro
Di
.
Therefore for the case of the phase transition in the system we see that the previous
principle does not work anymore. The entropy of the system in the equilibrium equals
the weighted sum of the entropies of the most probable macrostates and does not equal
the logarithm of the number of microstates over which the system can realize itself. The
situation is, in some sense, analogous to the Gibbs paradox when half of the gas in a volume
is transformed to another gas which immediately changes the entropy of the system.

as the equation of the topological balance. The analytical expressions of the constituting
derivatives are lengthy and not given here. One can easy obtain them by the diﬀerentiation
of equations (15), (40) and (42).
It should be emphasized that this equation is obtained for the case when the
equilibrium state is assumed to be a mixture of solutions of equation (15).
If we
would restrict the understanding of the equilibrium state to one isolated solution of
equation (15) then the probability distribution W equil
macro D(D) should be renormalized for
each maximum as W i
macro D(D) = (W equil
macro D(D))/(
vicinity of Di W equil
macro D(D)).
Then,
instead of equation (41) we obtain
Sequil

Di
≈ln ΔΓ
(49)
and for the equation of state we have NdDi = dSequil
i
· ln−1((1 −Di)/Di). This equation
can be obtained in the way similar to the discussion of equation (36) or by the direct
diﬀerentiation of equation (42).
For non-equilibrium states the increment of entropy
would be dS ≥d ln Nmacro
D
= NdD·ln ((1 −D)/D). So, we see that in the general case the
balance equation could be obtained by the diﬀerentiation of the non-equilibrium entropy.
What is peculiar here is the fact that for the general case the equation of topological
balance depends actually only on the degeneration of macrostates D given by equation (3)
and does not depend on the equilibrium probability distribution given by equation (2).
Therefore, only the structure of the system itself determines the balance equation and
the SC does not inﬂuence it. However, this constraint deﬁnes the equilibrium state and
in this way (1/T in equations (27) and (36)) determines how the balance equation would
look like in the EwSC.
So, for the general case the balance inequality (restricted only to one equilibrium
solution of equation (15)) is
dS ≥NdD · ln 1 −D
D
(50)
for equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Again, equation (50) is valid for an arbitrary
BC, not only for the cases ε = const or σ = const. Substituting geometrical constraint (1)

This is the most general case of the balance inequality for the FBM with a ﬁxed number
of ﬁbers.
8. Conclusion
It is shown that equilibrium statistical mechanics is not directly applicable to damage
phenomena. However, we are still able to use its mathematical formalism. An introduction
of the model stochasticity as an external stochastic constraint introduces ﬂuctuating
topological behavior into a system.
For the FBM with the constant external strain
constraint it is shown that these ﬂuctuations ‘statistically’ thermalize in general a non-
thermal system. The equilibrium ‘canonical’ distribution of probabilities is dictated by
the stochastic constraint instead of the temperature of the external medium. Then the
mathematical formalism of the statistical mechanics is developed independently for the
non-thermal system providing all classical features like the narrow probability maximum,
free energy potential, balance equation and equation of state. This gives rise to the new
statistical mechanics, the statistical mechanics of damage.
However, for the case of the constant external stress it is shown that the behavior
of the system becomes non-Gibbsian and, although many mathematical concepts are still
applicable, it is already impossible to deﬁne a temperature parameter for the system.
The behavior of the system exhibits the presence of a spinodal point with some
properties inherited from a critical point. However, the classiﬁcation of the order of phase
transitions is shown to be controversial and is based on the choice of the free energy
potential.
Also it should be noted that the obtained theoretical results have more general
applicability to damage phenomena and are not restricted only to the case of the ﬁber-
bundle model.
The ﬁber-bundle model considered in this paper was used only for
illustration purposes.
