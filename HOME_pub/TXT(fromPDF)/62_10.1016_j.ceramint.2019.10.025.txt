The drying step of dense refractory castables containing hydraulic binders is a critical process, which usually
requires using slow heating rates due to the high explosion trend of such materials during their ﬁrst thermal
treatment. Thus, this work investigated the performance of alternative additives to induce faster and safer drying
of self-ﬂowing high-alumina refractory castables bonded with calcium aluminate cement (CAC) or hydratable
alumina (HA). The following materials were analyzed for this purpose: polymeric ﬁbers, a permeability en-
hancing compound (RefPac MIPORE 20) and an organic additive (aluminum salt of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid).
The drying behavior and explosion resistance of the cured samples were evaluated when subjecting the prepared
castables to heating rates of 2, 5 or 20 °C/min and the obtained data were then correlated to the potential of the
drying agents to improve the permeability and mechanical strength level of the refractories at diﬀerent tem-
peratures. The collected results attested that the selected additives were more eﬃcient in optimizing the drying
behavior of the CAC-bonded compositions, whereas the HA-containing castables performed better when the
aluminum-based salt was blended with a small amount of CAC (0.5 wt%), which changed the binders hydration
reaction sequence and optimized the permeability level of the resulting microstructure. Consequently, some of
the designed compositions evaluated in this work showed improved drying behavior and no explosion was
observed even during the tests carried out under a high heating rate (20 °C/min).
1. Introduction
The growing demand for advanced refractory castables in recent
decades has been motivated by the requirements of industrial processes
operating at high temperatures, such as iron and steelmaking, cement
and glasses production, petrochemical, and others, which has helped to
develop new technologies and innovations in the design of high-per-
formance ceramic systems.
Although the continuous progress of refractory castables has fo-
cused on ﬁnding alternatives to reduce the use of hydraulic binders in
formulations, calcium aluminate cement (CAC) is still the most used
one in a large number of commercial products due to its ability to
provide higher green mechanical strength, presenting a suitable setting
time (around 6–24 h) and chemical resistance to a variety of corrosive
environments [1–3]. Hydratable alumina (HA) is another binder
usually applied in castable compositions, as it helps to design products
with high refractoriness, without the drawbacks (i.e., generation of
phases with low melting point) associated with the presence of CaO,
derived from CAC, in formulations containing alumina and silica [4–6].
During HA hydration, a thick layer of amorphous gel is initially
generated on the alumina's surface and it may be partially crystallized
at higher temperatures or over a longer time, into boehmite [Al2O3.
(1–2)H2O)] and bayerite (Al2O3·3H2O). Besides that, the gel phase is
able to ﬁll in the pores and defects of the microstructure [3,7], reducing
the refractory's permeability and, consequently, its explosion resistance
during the drying step.
As a consequence of the low permeability of dense castables bonded
with hydraulic binders, spallings or even explosions could take place
during the ﬁrst heating treatment of these ceramics, depending on the
selected heating schedule. Such behavior is related to the steam pres-
sure derived from the free-water release and decomposition of hydrated
phases at temperatures above 100 °C, as the entrapment of the gas
phase in the resulting microstructure during heating may easily lead to
pressure levels that exceed the green mechanical strength of the
ceramic. Thus, in order to avoid this undesired condition, the drying
schedule of dense refractory castables are usually based on various
dwell steps at intermediate temperatures in the 100–600 °C range,
which leads to very conservative heating procedures.
Aiming to optimize the energy eﬃciency and to reduce the cost
associated with this ﬁrst thermal treatment of the refractories, various

such materials and provide easier and safer vapor release. Some alter-
natives proposed in the literature are using additives that may act
generating permeable channels in the consolidated microstructure, fa-
voring the percolation of the pressurized ﬂuids during the ﬁrst heating
step of these materials. Among the proposed additives, using polymeric
ﬁbers with a low melting point and decomposition temperature is the
most common and well-known solution presented in the literature
[8–10]. For instance, polyethylene [11] and polypropylene ﬁbers are
likely drying agents for castables due to their low melting point
(100–120 °C and > 150 °C, respectively).
Additionally, a new sort of additive for enhancing the drying ability
of CAC-bonded castables has been reported in the literature, called
RefPac Mipore 20 (MP) [12,13]. This product acts by modifying the
cement hydration reaction sequence, giving rise to gel-like phases that
decompose mainly around 100–150 °C, inducing the formation of a
more permeable microstructure that allows the steam release from the
inner region up to the material's surface, during the initial stages of the
heating process [14]. The role of this additive in castables containing
other hydraulic binders is still not well described, although Luz et al.
[15] evaluated the incorporation of MP into vibratable high-alumina
HA-bonded refractories.
Aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid [Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3] is
also an interesting anti-explosion agent, which can increase the number
of permeable paths in magnesia-based refractory products [16–18].
However, the acting mechanism of this compound is not clearly re-
ported and there is a lack of studies using this additive in compositions
containing hydraulic binders.
Based on these aspects, this work investigates: (i) the inﬂuence of
two novel commercial drying agents commercially available [poly-
ethylene ﬁbers (Emsil-Dry) and the active compound called RefPac
MiPore 20] in the drying performance of self-ﬂowing high-alumina
refractory castables (containing calcium aluminate cement or hy-
dratable alumina as binders); and (ii) the feasibility of incorporating
aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid [Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3] into
hydratable alumina-bonded castables, as an alternative route to obtain
more permeable microstructures, which could be less prone to undergo
explosion under faster heating schedules.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Raw materials selection and designed compositions
High-alumina refractory castables were designed based on the
Andreasen's particle packing model [19,20], as described in Eq. (1), and
considering the distribution coeﬃcient (q) equal to 0.21, in order to
obtain self-ﬂowing compositions.

where CPFT is the cumulative percentage of particles ﬁner than D; q is

The selected raw materials for the studied formulations consisted of
tabular alumina (D ≤6 mm, Almatis, Germany), calcined and reactive
aluminas (CL370 and CT3000SG, respectively, supplied by Almatis,
Germany), as indicated in Table 1. Calcium aluminate cement (CAC,
Secar 71, Imerys Aluminates, France) or hydratable alumina (HA, Al-
phabond 300, Almatis, Germany) were the binders evaluated in this
work. In order to improve the drying ability of the castables, 0.1 wt% of
polyethylene ﬁbers with length < 6 mm (Emsil Dry, Elkem, Norway) or
2.5 wt% of the active compound Refpac Mipore 20 (MP, Imerys Alu-
minate, France) were incorporated into the CAC-bonded compositions.
The latter is a powdered additive (d50 ~10–20 μm), comprised by or-

(39–43 wt%), CaO (12–15 wt%) and MgO (16–20 wt%) [12]. Previous
investigations [13,14] reported that 2.5 wt% of MP in replacing the
CAC content is a suitable amount to provide improved ﬂowability,
green mechanical strength and high permeability for the castables. For
this reason, the same content of MP was selected to be used in the
designed compositions of this work.
Table 2 presents the compositions prepared for the evaluation of the
aluminum salt [AS, Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3, Quimibras Industrias Quí-
micas S.A., Brazil] as a drying agent for high-alumina castables bonded
with hydratable alumina (HA). According to some investigations pre-
sented in the literature [16–18], 0.3–0.5 wt% of AS may be suﬃcient to
modify the permeability of MgO-bonded castable compositions. Hence,
it was decided to analyze the addition of 0.3 or 0.6 wt% of this organic
compound to the designed alumina-based systems.
During the mixing step of the refractories, distinct water contents
were incorporated into the mixes (Tables 1 and 2), as well as 0.2 wt% of
a polymeric dispersant (Castament® FS60, BASF, Germany). The only
exception was related to the compositions containing RefPac MiPore
20, as this drying agent already contains dispersant compounds among
its components [13].
2.2. Refractory castables’ processing and characterization
The compositions with and without additives were prepared in a
planetary rheometer [21] and the mixing procedure consisted of dry
and wet homogenization stages. After that, the curing behavior and
setting time of the fresh castables’ mixes were characterized by mea-
suring the propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves (Ultrasonic Mea-
suring Test System IP-8, Germany) in the compositions as a function of
time at room temperature (~22 °C). The prepared castables were also
molded as: (i) cylinders (50 × 50 mm2) for the explosion and drying
tests; (ii) discs (d = 75 mm, h = 26 mm) for the permeability mea-
surements; and (iii) bars (150 × 25 × 25 mm3) for the 3-point bending
tests and apparent porosity characterization.
The samples’ curing was carried out at 30 °C for 24 h or 36 h and the
CAC-containing compositions were kept in closed plastic bags con-
taining a beaker with water in order to maintain a humid environment.
After that, the castables were demolded and dried at 110 °C for 24 h and
some of the specimens were calcined in the 200–400 °C range, using a
heating rate of 1 °C/min and dwell time of 5 h at the selected tem-
perature.
The drying behavior and explosion resistance of cured samples was
carried out in a device that simultaneously measured the thermo-
gravimetric proﬁles and the samples’ temperature [22], when applying
heating rates of 2, 5 and 20 °C/min up to 600 °C. On the other hand,
permeability tests were conducted at room temperature [23] using
samples obtained after drying at 110 °C/for 24 h and calcining at 200,
300 and 450 °C for 5 h. The Darcian (k1) and non-Darcian (k2) perme-
ability constants were calculated by ﬁtting the (

Additionally, cold modulus of rupture (3 point-bending tests, ASTM

containing polymeric ﬁbers or Refpac Mipore 20 (Table 1) were de-
termined after curing, drying and calcining (200, 300 and 400 °C for
5 h) these refractories. On the other hand, the formulations containing
aluminum salt were subjected to the same experimental tests, but their
properties were only evaluated after curing (30 °C for 24 or 36 h) and
drying (110 °C for 24) steps. A total of ﬁve samples for each composi-
tion and selected ﬁring temperature were analyzed during these

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Eﬀect of the polymeric ﬁbers (ED) and active compound (MP) in the
castables’ properties
The curing behavior and setting time of the prepared castables were
analyzed by recording the ultrasonic wave propagation velocity results
as a function of time at 22 °C for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1a, the reference
composition containing cement (5CAC) presented a great increase in
the measured velocity between 5 and 13 h, whereas the hardening
process of the one bonded with hydratable alumina (5HA, Fig. 1b)
began after 3 h, nevertheless presenting lower velocity values in the
evaluated period of time.
This performance may be related to the diﬀerences in the hydration
process of the tested hydraulic binders. For instance, CAC hydration
usually gives rise to hydrated compounds (i.e., CAH10, C2AH8, C3AH6
and/or AH3, where C = CaO, A = Al2O3 and H = H2O) and the like-
lihood of which one of them will be precipitated in the refractory mi-
crostructure is associated with the curing time and temperature con-
ditions, as well as the water content used during the mixing stage and
the humidity level available in the curing environment [12]. In order to
favor the precipitation of the most stable hydrates (crystalline C3AH6
and AH3), curing temperatures above 35 °C are suggested, which should
result in refractories with improved green mechanical strength [2]. As
the ultrasonic measurements were carried out at room temperature
(22 °C), other metastable hydrated compounds (such as CAH10, C2AH8
and gel-like AH3) may also be generated in the designed compositions,
and the precipitation of these compounds is responsible for the setting

3and hardening behavior of the CAC-bonded castables (Fig. 1a).
On the other hand, the hydration of hydratable alumina is based on
the generation of gel-like hydrated phases, which can crystallize and
mainly result in the formation of Al2O3·3H2O and Al2O3.(1–2)H2O.
Such transformations usually lead to microstructures with limited per-
meability level and lower green mechanical strength than the ones
derived from CAC hydration process [7]. As conﬁrmed in Fig. 1b, in-
deed HA-bonded castables presented lower velocity results than the
compositions containing CAC, which can be related to the development
of samples’ with lower elastic modulus for the former formulations.
The incorporation of the polymeric ﬁbers (ED) into the designed
compositions did not induce signiﬁcant changes in the curing behavior
of the castables, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the presence of the MP
additive modiﬁed the hydration reaction sequence of the binders
[12–15], which aﬀected the setting time of the castables, speeding up
their hardening.
A more cohesive microstructure is associated to higher mechanical
strength and lower permeability level, and both aspects have important

4roles on the drying behavior of ceramic linings. For instance, the HA-
bonded refractories presented lower ﬂexural strength (Fig. 2b) than the
ones with CAC (Fig. 2a), which indicates that such materials are more
prone to fail or explode, as they will be able to withstand limited steam
pressure levels during heating. Moreover, higher water content was
added to the hydratable alumina-containing compositions (Table 1),
increasing the refractories’ pressurization likelihood.
The mechanical strength of the analyzed castables increased when
drying the samples at 110 °C or ﬁring them at diﬀerent temperatures in
the range of 200–400 °C (Fig. 2), most likely due to the crystallization of
the gel-like hydrates and formation of interconnected crystalline hy-
drated phases in the microstructure at higher temperatures, favoring
binding among the adjacent coarse and ﬁne components of the com-
position [3,6]. Although the release of free-water and the decomposi-
tion of the hydrated compound may induce the samples’ porosity in-
crease, the binding eﬀect enhanced the overall cold ﬂexural strength
values of the designed refractories.
Regarding the additive-containing refractories, adding ﬁbers to
5CAC-ED and 5HA-ED did not aﬀect the mechanical strength of the
samples to a major extent (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the permeability

5enhancing compound (MP) led to the decrease in the castables’ modulus
of rupture in all tested conditions, when compared to the reference
materials (5CAC or 5HA). Such behavior has already been reported in
previous studies [12–15], and it was related to the interaction of this
additive with the binders, which changes the hydration reaction se-
quence and the precipitated phases in the resulting microstructure.
Despite this side eﬀect, MP is very eﬀective in increasing the per-
meability level of the 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP compositions, fa-
voring the development of high k1 and k2 (permeability constants)
values even for the materials just dried at 110 °C for 24 h or calcined up
to 400 °C for 5 h (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the reference refractories
(5CAC or 5HA) presented very low permeability in all evaluated con-
ditions, which prevented the measurements of k1 and k2 for the 5HA
samples after drying at 110 °C and ﬁring at 200 °C for 5 h, when using
the chosen permeameter equipment [24]. Hence, in such cases (110 °C
and 200 °C), the permeability constant values for 5HA were lower than
the ones obtained for the same composition when ﬁred at 300 °C for 5 h
(k1 = 8.98 × 10−18 m2 and k2 = 4.70 × 10−18 m).
In general, the incorporation of the polymeric ﬁbers to 5CAC-ED
and 5HA-ED compositions only provided a slight increase of the overall
permeability constants, maintaining the measured values in the same
order of magnitude as the reference materials (5CAC and 5HA, Fig. 3).
Considering that both green mechanical strength and permeability
are important parameters that play a role in the drying behavior of
dense castables, the following step consisted of evaluating the drying
performance and explosion resistance of the cured samples (30 °C/24 h)
during their ﬁrst thermal treatment. According to Fig. 4a and b, no
explosion was observed when heating the castables with a 2 °C/min rate
and the main mass loss took place from 30 to 120 °C for 2.5CAC-MP and
2.5HA-MP compositions, whereas the additive-free and the ﬁber-con-
taining materials presented more complex proﬁles with mass changes
observed mainly in the following temperature ranges: 30–250 °C,
250–350 °C and 350–500 °C (Fig. 4b). As the evaluated specimens were
only cured before testing, the high mass loss identiﬁed at the beginning
of the TG tests (30–120 °C) should be associated to the free-water re-
lease and decomposition of gel-like phases. On the other hand, poly-
meric ﬁbers and crystalline hydrate decomposition (i.e., C2AH8, C3AH6,
AH3) was mainly detected above 250 °C [12–15]. Due to the higher
water demand during the preparation of HA-bonded materials, such
samples showed increased mass loss when compared to the CAC-based
refractories (Fig. 4a).
When increasing the applied heating rates (5 and 20 °C/min) during
the TG measurements, 5HA, 5HA-ED and 5CAC castables underwent
explosion around 200–300 °C (Fig. 4c–f), as a result of the reduced

6microstructures. The ED incorporation into the CAC-bonded composi-
tion (5CAC-ED) did not induce major changes in the cold ﬂexural
strength (Fig. 2a) and permeability constants (Fig. 3a and c) of this
material when compared to 5CAC. Nevertheless, the eﬀect of the ﬁbers
in this system was already enough to inhibit the samples' explosion. The
same performance was not achieved for the 5HA-ED composition,
which can be explained by both the lower mechanical strength and
permeability level of these samples (Figs. 2b, 3b and d). As the 5HA-ED
explosion took place at 257 °C and the ﬁbers’ thermal decomposition
should mainly occur above 320 °C (Fig. 5) [15], the selected additive
was not able to act in its full potential during the TG tests carried out
with high heating rates, resulting in a microstructure with a limited
number of permeable paths for the water vapor release that, as a con-
sequence, favored the pressurization of the samples. Hence, the poly-
meric additive must not only melt at low temperatures, but also de-
compose to generate suitable permeable channels.
The eﬀect of MP addition to 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP was char-
acterized by a signiﬁcant mass loss in the 100–150 °C temperature
range (Fig. 4a, c and e), which can be related to the free-water release
and decomposition of the gel-like phase derived from the interaction of
MP with the binders [12]. These transformations were responsible for
increasing the overall permeability of the samples (Fig. 3) and pro-
viding better and safer conditions for drying the MP-containing ca-
stables. Despite the inﬂuence of MP in decreasing the ﬂexural strength
of the cured 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP samples (Fig. 2), its role in
improving the number of permeable paths in the microstructure at the
beginning of the heating process (even at 110 °C, Fig. 4) is of major
importance to inhibit the castables’ pressurization.
3.2. Eﬀect of the aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid in adjusting the
drying behavior of HA-bonded castables
Knowing that 5HA castable is more susceptible to explosion during
heating (Fig. 4), due to its reduced permeability and mechanical
strength (Figs. 2 and 3), another route (instead of adding ED or MP)
should be required to optimize the microstructure of this refractory.
Thus, it was decided to study an additional agent to improve the drying
behavior of castables containing hydratable alumina.
Fig. 6 indicates that the incorporation of aluminum salt 2-hydro-
xypropanoic acid (AS) modiﬁed the hydration behavior of the used
binder, delaying the setting time (velocity increase was shifted to longer
times) and reducing the measured velocity values. This behavior is
associated with the action of AS, as initially its dissolution should take
place in the liquid medium (Eq. (3)), changing the overall pH of the
refractory system. For instance, after the mixing step, the following pH
results were obtained for castables 5HA, 5HA-0.6AS and 5HA-0.6AS-
0.5CAC: 9.44, 8.23 and 8.76, respectively.
(CH3CHOHCOO)3Al(s) ↔3(CH3CHOHCOO−)(aq) + Al3+

(3)
The pH decrease usually aﬀects ρ-alumina hydration, changing the
overall content of the crystalline (bohemite and bayerite) and amor-
phous hydrates (gel-like phase) formed in the resulting microstructure
[26]. X-ray diﬀraction of the cured castables’ matrix (results not shown
here) pointed out that no crystalline compounds were detected in the
AS-containing samples, indicating that this additive aﬀected the hy-
dration path of the prepared castables. Besides that, it was not possible
to demold the cast samples of these compositions due to their low
mechanical strength after curing at 30 °C/24 h. Hence, a longer curing
period (~36 h) was required to allow a suitable handling of the 5HA-
0.3AS and 5HA-0.6AS specimens. In order to overcome this issue, ad-
ditional compositions containing AS + 0.5 wt% of CAC (5HA-0.3AS-
0.5CAC and 5HA-0.6AS-0.5CAC) were processed and the collected re-
sults highlighted that an improved curing behavior (Fig. 6) and green
mechanical strength (Fig. 7a) could be obtained for these castables after
a curing time of 24 h.
The CAC addition to the AS-containing compositions may ﬁrstly
induce the generation of a complex compound due to the interaction of
the Ca2+ ions with the aqueous species resulting from AS dissolution
(Eq. (4)). Additionally, the dissociation of this complex phase should
also favor Al(OH)3 precipitation (Eq. (5)) in the resulting mixture,
leading to the castable's stiﬀening in a proper period of time [1].

Cold ﬂexural strength and apparent porosity increase could be ob-
served for the prepared compositions after the drying step at 110 °C/
24 h (Fig. 7a). Despite the low mechanical strength of the AS-containing
compositions for the tested conditions, their greater porosity levels
might be a positive aspect to prevent thermal crack propagation during
a ﬁrst heating cycle and it could be related to the shrinkage and/or
cracking of the gel-like phase generated in the refractories’ micro-
structure [12]. Moreover, when analyzing the permeability constants
measured for the dried (110 °C) and calcined samples (200–400 °C) of
the HA-bonded materials, it was observed that AS eﬀectively enhanced
k1 and k2 values of the prepared castables, when compared to the re-
sults obtained for the reference composition (Tables 3 and 4).
In order to evaluate the explosion resistance of the AS-containing
castables, thermogravimetric tests of cured samples were carried out up
to 600 °C using the same heating rates shown in Section 3.1 (2, 5 and
20 °C/min). Considering that pseudo-bohemite, bayerite and bohemite
decomposition
occur in the range of 100–180 °C, ~300 °C and

7450–550 °C, respectively [4,6], the main advantage of adding AS to HA-
bonded refractories is the likelihood of shifting the most intense mass
loss step to earlier temperatures (below 200 °C), as indicated in Fig. 8.
This performance is related to free-water release and the decomposition
of the gel-like complex phase derived from the AS presence in the mix
that induced the generation of microstructures with higher porosity and
permeable paths (Fig. 7b and Tables 3 and 4), which can prevent the
steam pressurization during heating.
As reported in the literature [25], the interaction of CaO (derived
from CAC addition to 5HA-0.3AS-0.5CAC and 5HA-0.6AS-0.5CAC) with
the selected aluminum salt during the mixing and curing stages might
also give rise to CaC6H10O6·5H2O, which can decompose approximately
at 130 °C. This transformation and the withdrawal of free-water may
explain the more intense DTG peak of the CAC-containing formulations
at temperatures close to 130–150 °C (Fig. 8b).
No explosion was observed when conducting the thermogravimetric
analyses of the cured castables’ samples with a 2 °C/min heating rate
(Fig. 8a and b), which can be related to the longer time available for the
withdrawal of the water added to the mixes during their processing
steps. However, as expected, a faster drying rate (5 °C/min or 20 °C/
min) induced the explosion of the reference refractory composition
(Fig. 8c and e). The formulations containing AS and AS + CAC pre-
sented a better performance and higher explosion resistance due to the
role of such drying additive in increasing the permeability of the
Fig. 8. (a, c and e) Mass loss proﬁles and (b, d and f) ﬁrst derivative of the mass loss results for the HA-bonded refractory castables.

8resulting microstructure (Tables 3 and 4). When applying a more severe
heating condition (20 °C/min), only the samples containing higher AS
amount and 0.5 wt% of CAC withstood the thermal and mechanical
stresses associated to the drying step (Fig. 8e), indicating that a proper
balance between mechanical strength and permeability level of the
microstructure could be achieved. Therefore, the selected aluminum
salt enabled a large amount of water vapor to be safely released at the
initial evaporation stage (100–150 °C) of the drying process [9,12],
mainly due to the generation of a higher number of permeable paths.
4. Conclusions
This work investigated the role of novel commercial drying agents
(polyethylene ﬁbers = ED, enhancing a permeability active compound
called Refpac Mipore 20 = MP and aluminum salt 2-hydroxipropanoic
acid = AS) in dense high-alumina refractory systems containing cal-
cium aluminate cement and hydratable alumina as binders. According
to the obtained results, ED was an eﬀective additive to induce a suitable
optimization of the CAC-bonded compositions’ permeability, pre-
venting their explosion during heating. However, the same positive
eﬀect was not achieved when adding these ﬁbers to formulations con-
taining hydratable alumina.
MP was an interesting and versatile alternative route to adjust the
castables' microstructure, as its addition to both evaluated systems
(formulations bonded with calcium aluminate cement or hydratable
alumina) resulted in permeable structures that allowed faster water
vapor release in the 100–150 °C range. Such behavior was associated
with its eﬀect in modifying the hydration reaction sequence of the
binders, giving rise to a gel-like phase, instead of crystalline ones,
which can undergo decomposition at lower temperatures. Hence, MP
was able to provide safer and faster drying procedures for dense ca-
stables. The only negative aspect of using this active compound in the
designed compositions is the observed decay of the samples’ green
mechanical strength when compared to the additive-free one.
In the case of using aluminum salt 2-hydroxipropanoic acid in the
designed HA-bonded compositions, the action of this additive was si-
milar to the one induced by MP, as it induced changes in the binder
hydration reactions. Consequently, the curing behavior and setting time
of the AS-containing compositions were delayed and a drop of the green
mechanical strength values was observed. Nevertheless, these negative
aspects could be minimized when adding 0.5 wt% of CAC to HA-bonded
with AS additive, which resulted in samples with major mass loss at
relatively low temperatures (< 200 °C) during heating and suitable
mechanical strength and permeability values. Castable 5HA-0.6AS-
0.5CAC was the most promising compositions as it withstood even the
most severe tested condition (heating rate = 20 °C/min) without pre-
senting explosion of the samples.
