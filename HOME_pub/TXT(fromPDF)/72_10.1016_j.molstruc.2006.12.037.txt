Abstract
Using a semiclassical continuum model of an electron in a deformable molecular crystal, some properties of multicomponent gener-
alizations of the polaron – ‘‘vector polarons’’ – are elucidated. Analytical solutions for the case of two electronic bands coupled to two
vibrational modes are given in detail. Within the model considered, the vector polaron can be classiﬁed by its wavefunction into several
types and can have features that include: (1) a spatial variation in the electronic and vibrational character, and (2) low-energy internal
degrees of freedom. For the case of electronic and vibrational degeneracy, local Jahn–Teller interactions can also lead to a novel spa-
tiotemporal soliton, a long-lived excited state of the many-electron system stabilized by the conservation law resulting from degeneracy.

1. Introduction
Many of the complex solids currently under intensive
theoretical and experimental study have common attri-
butes. High Tc superconductors, fullerene-based materials,
and colossal magnetoresistive manganites all feature elec-
tronic and vibrational degeneracies that are a consequence
of the spatial symmetries of the crystal structure. These sys-
tems typically have multiple electronic and structural phas-
es competing at low temperatures. And there is ample
evidence [1] that the electron–phonon interaction and the
resulting polaron quasiparticles play an important role in
shaping many of the physical properties of these materials.
These observations serve as motivation for the theoreti-
cal study of the eﬀects of generalized electron–phonon cou-
pling
in
multiband
systems.
Using
a
semiclassical
continuum model of an electron in a deformable molecular
crystal, the eﬀects of electronic and vibrational degeneracy
(and near degeneracy) on polaron structure have been
investigated. With the inclusion of local Jahn–Teller cou-
plings within the degenerate manifolds, a multicomponent
polaron emerges as a solution of the semiclassical equa-
tions of motion [2].
Experimentally the richer vibrational and electronic
structure of this ‘‘vector polaron’’ might well be probed
using STM to image the charge density in the vicinity of
a vector polaron trapped at a defect. This would be similar
to the STM studies of the surface of an anisotropically gap-
ped superconductor with impurities [3], where the order
parameter symmetry has a great eﬀect in shaping spatial
features of the local electron density of states in the vicinity
of an impurity, and this can be seen through measurements
of the local conductivity.
2. The model
Consider a molecular solid with two orbitals per mole-
cule: jw1æ and jw2æ. The molecule is also taken to have
two vibrational modes: a breathing mode with amplitude
/0 and a symmetry-breaking mode with amplitude /1.
The orbitals are taken to transform under elements of the
molecular point group so that the symmetry-breaking

where W(x) is a two-component ﬁeld operator. The upper
component destroys an electron from the ﬁrst orbital at
x, while the lower component destroys an electron from
the second orbital at x. In the absence of distortions, the
band constructed from jw1æ states is oﬀset in energy by
2D from the band constructed from jw2æ states. The limit
D ﬁ0 corresponds to doubly degenerate bands.
A continuum approximation to the local E  b model
studied by Ho¨ck et al. [4] is recovered in the limit g0 ﬁ0,
while the continuum Holstein molecular crystal model [5]
is obtained in the limit g1 ﬁ0. Hence, the model of Eq.
(1) combines the Holstein model and the E  b model.
3. Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for this
model can be found by expanding the ﬁeld operator in
terms of a new real-space basis. Envelope functions

duced, and the ﬁeld operator becomes

(unitarity) on the amplitudes is then

where the sums are over all occupied states.
For a system with a single electron, only one term con-
tributes to the sum. Eqs. (8) can be substituted into the
BdG equations to obtain the two coupled nonlinear Schro¨-
dinger equations for the envelope functions u, v previously
obtained in Ref. [2]

The single electron might also be thought of as occupying
a conduction band or partially occupying a set of conduction
bands. Provided the polarization eﬀects from the ﬁlled
valence band are small, the ‘‘frozen’’ valence band approxi-
mation can be made, and the identical BdG equations result.

Eqs. (11) have been previously studied in many diﬀerent
contexts such as nonlinear optics (propagation of light in
birefringent optical ﬁbers [6]) and atomic physics (spinor
Bose–Einstein condensation [7]) where the resulting Ginz-
burg–Landau equations have the same form. Although
the mathematical study of systems of coupled nonlinear
Schro¨dinger equations is still in its infancy, a set of known
solutions in 1D and 2D to these equations that describe the
components of the vector polaron wavefunction will now
be summarized.
4. Vector polarons in 1D
For one spatial dimension, three regimes can be identi-
ﬁed where analytic solutions to Eq. (11) that are stable
and localized are known to exist. In general, it is required
that  < 0 and jj < D. g and m are restricted here to be
non-negative. Thus, 0 6 b 6 1.
4.1. Manakov type
The case of b = 1 and x = 1 is special, as it corresponds
to an integrable system. Manakov [8] studied this system of
204

tions gives rise to an inﬁnite set of degenerate solutions that
can be labeled by a continuous parameter 0 6 h < 2p.

x = 1 corresponds to exact degeneracy (D = 0), while b = 1
results from no coupling to the symmetry-breaking mode
(g1 ﬁ0). Consequently, the energy of the state is indepen-
dent of orbital density diﬀerences. Thus the Manakov solu-
tion contains a zero-energy internal degree of freedom,
corresponding to periodic changes in the local orbital
mixing.
4.2. Equal amplitude type
Another situation that is exactly soluble is the ‘‘equal
amplitude’’ case where r1(n) = r2(n). For stable, localized
solutions, the parameters must be further restricted so that
x = 1. In this case, Eqs. (11) reduce to

The continuous symmetry present in the Manakov case is
broken for b „ 1. However, rotations of the orbital mixing
still serve as a low-energy degree of freedom for b close to
1.
4.3. Wave-daughter wave type
For x < 1, corresponding to non-degeneracy of the orbi-
tals, it is possible to have one envelope function dominate
throughout the core of the localized wavefunction. In this
wave-daughter wave approximation, the amplitude of the
daughter wave r2 is much smaller than that of the primary
wave r1, leading to the following approximate set of
equations

Within these cases amenable to analytical solutions, it is
seen that (1) vector polaron states can support low-energy
internal degrees of freedom, corresponding to pseudo-rota-
tions of the electron amplitude in the orbital space; and (2)
vector polaron states can have spatial variations in the
orbital mixing and in the character of the distortion, as
illustrated in the wave-daughter wave type.
5. Vector polarons in 2D
Vortex vector solitary wave solutions are known to exist in
2D. Consider solutions to Eqs. (11) of the form ri(q,/) =
wi(q) exp(imi/). The following coupled equations result

where Dq  1

labeled by the topological charges jm1, m2æ.
The simplest case is the j0,0æ solution, where both enve-
lope functions are radially symmetric. Using an analytical
variational method, the existence of a localized j0,0æ solu-
tion has been shown [10]. Unfortunately this solution has
also been shown to be linearly unstable, as are all of these
vortex solitons. Related multipole vector solitons [12] are
also linearly unstable in this simpliﬁed model.
However, similar solutions that are linearly stable have
been found for slightly modiﬁed systems of equations that
include either saturable nonlinearities [10] or nonlocal non-
linearities [11]. Saturable nonlinearities would physically
correspond to the addition of proper vibrational anharmo-
nicity of higher orders in this model, while nonlocal nonlin-
earity would correspond to gradient terms in the elastic
energy. Consequently there are indications that semiclassi-
cal multicomponent polaron states of the vortex and mul-
tipole varieties stably exist in generalized models of 2D
systems.
6. Jahn–Teller soliton
Another related continuum model that employs a local
Jahn–Teller coupling can also lead to a stable soliton, a
state involving a lump of excess electronic charge trapped
by a time-dependent pseudo-rotation of the elastic ﬁeld
[13]. These solitons fall in the class of solutions known as
non-topological Q-balls [14] that have been invoked in
models of cosmological phase transitions in the early Uni-
verse [15].

205Consider a continuum model with three electronic bands
linearly coupled to two degenerate elastic modes. Take the
case of where the electronic bands transform as a doublet
(x,y) and a trivial orbital singlet; the two elastic modes
transform as x and y. The system may be described by
the following Hamiltonian
H ¼ H el þ H ph þ H JT
ð20Þ
where

ð23Þ
where W is the energy splitting between the doublet bands
and the singlet, and m labels the states in the axial angular
momentum basis.
Such a system has a continuous symmetry whose origin
lies in the electronic and vibrational degeneracy. By virtue
of Noether’s theorem, a conserved charge Q results from
this continuous symmetry provided it remains unbroken.
The constraint of ﬁxed Q provides stability to the soliton
state.
For large Q, a variational ansatz called the thin wall
approximation [14] has been found to give good results
in calculating the soliton energy. The amplitude of the elas-
tic deformation is taken to be constant over a ﬁnite region
of space with volume V, while vanishing outside that
region. This deformation itself, however, is not constant;
rather, it undergoes pseudo-rotations in the twofold degen-
erate space. It is straightforward to show that the Noether
charge Q is linearly proportional to the pseudo-rotation
frequency x and to the square of the amplitude of distor-
tion [13]
Q  xn2V
ð24Þ
Thus, for suﬃciently large band splitting W, the energy of
this thin-walled soliton is
E ¼ ðKph þ U  EJTÞV
 1
2 x2n2V þ Uðn2ÞV  g2n0
W n2V
 Q2
2n2V
þ ~Uðn2ÞV
ð25Þ
where Kph and U are the kinetic and potential energy
density of the time-dependent distortion, EJT is the ener-
gy density from the electron-phonon interaction, n0 is the
electron density, and ~U  Uðn2Þ  g2n0
W n2. The last step
follows from using Eq. (24) to eliminate x in favor of
Q and n.
As Coleman [14] showed, the resulting energy can be
minimized subject to ﬁxed Q to ﬁnd the soliton energy
and its size.
E ¼ Q

ð27Þ
Thus provided that the minimum value of 2 ~U=n2 occurs at
n „ 0, this Jahn–Teller soliton cannot decay by emitting
phonons that carry away the charge Q, since the energy
per charge is lower for the soliton. This criterion sets the
requirements on the amount and type of anharmonicity
that are necessary to stabilize the soliton.
In summary, it is noted that many of the solitons, both
topological and non-topological, that are found in multi-
component Ginzburg–Landau theories can be used to
describe vector polarons within the semiclassical theory
outlined here. Experimental STM studies of these states
trapped at defects might be used to reveal the non-trivial
spatial structure of these polarons. Vector polarons,
together with the many-electron Q-ball-like excited state,
serve as examples that systems containing electronic and
vibrational degeneracy can support novel states through
local Jahn–Teller interactions.
