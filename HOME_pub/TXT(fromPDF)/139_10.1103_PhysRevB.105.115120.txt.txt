We have performed magnetotransport and high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements on topological insulator PdxBi2Te3(0 ⩽x ⩽0.20) single crystals. We have observed
unusually high values of magnetoresistance (∼1500%) and mobility (∼93 000 cm2 V–1 s–1) at low temperatures
for pristine Bi2Te3 that decrease upon Pd doping. Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations were detected for
x = 0.05, 0.10, conﬁrming the presence of two-dimensional topological surface states (TSSs) for these samples.
Hall measurement shows the crossover from n-type charge carriers in pristine Bi2Te3 to p-type charge carriers
upon Pd doping. The ARPES measurements show that the conduction band crosses the Fermi level for pristine
Bi2Te3, and the Dirac point of the TSSs and bulk-derived valence bands indicated a shift to lower binding energy
upon Pd doping in a rigid-band-like way up to x ∼0.10. Based on the comparison of the parameters obtained
from the SdH and ARPES measurements, the reduction in the kF value in the magnetotransport measurements is
likely due to the band bending induced by the Schottky barrier.

I. INTRODUCTION
Topological insulators (TIs) are one of the most excit-
ing and studied systems in contemporary condensed-matter
physics. TIs are characterized by gapless topological surface
states (TSSs) that are located inside the bulk band gap. The
TSSs remain gapless under the perturbation conserving the
topological number, which is calculated based on the symme-
try properties of the wave functions in the bulk [1,2]. The TSS
has a helical spin texture, and its dispersion around the time-
reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) can be regarded as that of
a massless Dirac fermion [3]. Electrons in the TSS acquire a π
Berry phase after adiabatically completing a closed trajectory
around the Fermi surface [4]. TIs exhibit a variety of exotic
electronic transport properties such as nonsaturating linear
magnetoresistance, the low-ﬁeld weak antilocalization (WAL)
effect, Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations, and high car-
rier mobility [5]. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy studies have
directly revealed a Dirac-cone-like TSS in the bulk band gap
[6,7].
Layered Bi2Te3 is one of the typical three-dimensional TIs,
and its TSS has been studied extensively through transport

and spectroscopy experiments [6,8]. Bi2Te3 crystallizes in a
rhombohedral crystal structure with space group R¯3m (no.
166) [9]. The unit cell of Bi2Te3 is comprised of three quin-
tuple layers (QLs) that are bonded by weak van der Waals
forces, and each QL consists of ﬁve atomic layers arranged
in a TeI-Bi-TeII-Bi-TeI sequence. This weak binding force
between Te atoms in adjacent QLs accounts for the easy cleav-
age along the ab-plane perpendicular to the c-axis, and the
anisotropic thermal and electronic transport properties arise
from these structural properties. The spectroscopy studies in-
dicate that Bi2Te3 is an indirect narrowband-gap (∼150 meV)
topological insulator with a single Dirac cone at the ¯ point
[6]. Bi2Te3 has been known for the highest thermoelectric
ﬁgure of merit (ZT ) around room temperature [10]. Super-
conductivity has also been observed in Bi2Te3 under high
pressures between 3 and 6 GPa with a superconducting tran-
sition temperature of Tc ∼3 K in the rhombohedral phase
without a structural phase transition [11–13].
Previously, Hor et al. [14] reported superconductivity
at Tc ∼5.5 K in PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0)
compounds through ac susceptibility and resistivity measure-
ments. Amit et al. [15] discussed the temperature-dependent
resistivity and magnetic susceptibility at various magnetic
ﬁelds (H) and pressure (p) to construct the phase diagram for
the superconducting compound PdBi2Te3. The superconduct-
ing transition temperature was decreased from Tc ∼5.5 K
with increasing pressure. Both of the above reports indicated
a small superconducting volume fraction of ∼1% for the
compound PdBi2Te3, which is likely due to the difﬁculty
in Pd intercalation into the van der Waals gap between the

QLs [14]. So far, however, the magnetotransport and high-
resolution ARPES measurements of Pd-doped Bi2Te3 have
not been explored yet. These measurements are quite useful
in understanding the electron dynamics and electronic band
structure, and they may give useful information about the
topological surface states. Pd is a higher Z element in compar-
ison to other dopants viz. Nb, Cu, and Sr, and it is known to
show exchange-enhanced magnetic susceptibility. It is there-
fore worth investigating the Pd doping from the viewpoint
of tailoring the electronic transport, spin-orbit coupling, and
topological surface states of the Bi2Te3.
In this study, we present detailed electronic transport prop-
erties and high-resolution ARPES studies to investigate the
palladium-doped bismuth telluride (PdxBi2Te3) single crys-
tals. We have observed a large value of the magnetoresistance
and ultrahigh mobility at low temperatures in pristine Bi2Te3.
The evolution of the electronic transport and topological sur-
face state properties upon Pd doping is discussed in light
of magnetoresistance, quantum oscillations, WAL, and the
electronic structure revealed by high-resolution ARPES. By
combining the results from ARPES and SdH oscillation
measurements, we are able to discuss the macroscopic mag-
netotransport properties from the viewpoint of microscopic
electronic band structure.
II. EXPERIMENTS
Single crystals of PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20)
were grown using the ﬂux method in two steps. High-purity
elemental Bi (99.99%), Te (99.999%), and Pd (99.99%) from
Sigma-Aldrich Co. were accurately weighed according to
the stoichiometric ratios and vacuum sealed (>10–5 mbar) in
quartz tubes. In the ﬁrst step, Bi2Te3 were prepared for all the
compositions. The compounds were heated at 850 °C for 24 h,
followed by cooling to 500 °C at the rate 10 °C/h, where they
were kept for 72 h. Then, the compounds were furnace-off
cooled to room temperature. Second, for Pd-doped samples,
the melted Bi2Te3 and Pd were mixed thoroughly using a
mortar and pestle, pelletized and vacuum-sealed, and kept for
another heat treatment at 850 °C for 48 h, then slow-cooled
(3 °C/h) to 400 °C and kept for 12 h. Then, the compounds
were furnace-off cooled to room temperature. Single crystals
were obtained from the ingots easily by cleaving perpendicu-
lar to the (00l) axis.
The crystal structure and phase purity of the samples were
determined by x-ray diffraction measurement at room temper-
ature using Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ =
1.5418 Å) radiation. The morphological studies on freshly
exfoliated samples were studied using energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) and a ﬁeld-emission scanning electron
microscope (FESEM FEI, Nova Nano SEM 450). Figures S1
and S2 depict the x-ray diffraction patterns, Rietveld reﬁne-
ment, and layered morphology of studied samples [16]. The
resistivity and Hall effect measurements were performed in
a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum
Design, Inc.) using the standard four-probe contact conﬁg-
uration in the temperature range 1.8–300 K up to magnetic
ﬁelds of 8 T. Magnetization measurements were performed
in a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS, Quan-
tum Design, Inc.). The magnetic ﬁeld was perpendicular to
the cleaved plane of crystals and the current direction. The
samples were exfoliated using scotch tape before performing
the above measurements.
The high-resolution ARPES measurements were carried
out using the μ-Laser ARPES system developed at the Hi-
roshima Synchrotron Radiation Center, Hiroshima University,
Japan [17]. The samples were cleaved in situ on the ﬁve-axes
manipulator at a temperature of 20 K, using the top-post
method. The base pressure was below 5 × 10–9 Pa. The
Dirac-cone-like spectrum was measured in the s-polarization
geometry along the ¯ −¯M high-symmetry line of the surface
Brillouin zone. Azimuthal sample alignment was performed
ex situ via measurements of Laue patterns, while the ¯-point
position was determined by a ﬁne angular map along the
direction perpendicular to the dispersive direction of the an-
alyzer slit. The position of the Fermi level was determined
using the Fermi edge of the reference sample in electrical con-
tact with the sample. The Laser spot size (on the sample) was
less than 10 μm, resulting in an intrinsic angular resolution
of less than 0.05 °. The overall instrumental energy resolution
was estimated to be better than 2 meV.
III. RESULTS
A. Transport measurements
Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of longi-
tudinal resistivity (ρxx) of PdxBi2Te3 crystals from 1.8 to
300 K measured under zero ﬁeld. The ρxx exhibits metal-
lic behavior throughout the temperature range. The residual
resistivity ratio (RRR), which is deﬁned as the ratio of
resistivity at room temperature to that at low temperature
[RRR = ρ(300 K)/ρ0(1.8 K)], decreased on Pd doping from
∼57 for Bi2Te3 to ∼4 for Pd0.20Bi2Te3. The high value of
RRR for Bi2Te3 is further reﬂected in the narrow linewidth
in the high-resolution ARPES spectrum, which is among
the best for the 3D TIs [6,18–24]. It has been reported that
Bi2Te3 shows distinct resistivity behavior with varying values
of RRR for different pieces of the crystal even if they are
taken from the same batch grown in the same ampoule [8].
The electronic properties of these compounds strongly depend
on the internal defects and inhomogeneity in the material.
Theoretical studies by Black-Schaffer et al. on the role of
subsurface impurities and vacancies in the 3D TIs suggested
that bulk impurities can give rise to gapless bulk conduc-
tivity and may mask the surface transport properties [25].
Therefore, we measured ρxx(T ) on the four different pieces
of the crystal for each composition (see Fig. S3 [16]). Sam-
ples taken from some portions of the crystal were found to
exhibit a broad hump shape around 100–150 K, suggesting
that the transport properties are sensitive to the inhomo-
geneity of the tellurium and antisite defects present in the
crystal. At low temperatures, all the ρxx(T ) show saturation
below 10 K, implying the ﬁnite residual resistivity. We have
observed a signature of superconductivity in Pd0.20Bi2Te3
below Tc ∼2.2 K in the magnetization measurements [see
the M(T ) and M(H) curves in Fig. S4 [16]]. However, we
could not detect superconductivity in the resistivity measure-
ments, which is likely due to the low superconducting volume
fraction.

FIG. 1. (a) Temperature dependence of zero-ﬁeld longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) for PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) of crystals, and
(b) and (c) show the variation of carrier density (n) and mobility (μ) with temperature, respectively, calculated from Hall resistivity data.
Figure 1(b) depicts the variation of charge carrier density
(n) in the temperature range 1.8–300 K. The bulk carrier den-
sity was estimated using a single-carrier Drude band model,
n(T ) = 1/[eRH(T )]. The slope has been calculated from the
linear part of the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of ρxy (see Fig.
S5 [16]). It is evident that for all temperatures, ρxy is linear
and negative for Bi2Te3, implying the presence of n-type bulk
charge carriers. With an increase in Pd concentration, ρxy
changes its sign, manifesting the hole-dominant transport in
such systems. We ﬁnd that the bulk carrier density is in the
range 1018–1019 cm–3 for PdxBi2Te3 without any appreciable
temperature dependence except for Pd0.05Bi2Te3. It should
be noted that there is a sharp change in the carrier con-
centration of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 above T = 20 K. The transverse
resistivity ρxy(H) of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 (see Fig. S5 [16]) shows
a sudden change in the slope between low-temperature and
high-temperature ρxy(H) values.
Using Hall coefﬁcient (RH) and longitudinal resistivity
(ρxx) data, we have estimated the Hall mobility (μ), as shown
in Fig. 1(c). We found the smallest observed carrier density
(7.58 × 1017 cm–3) and the lowest residual resistivity (8.8 ×
10–5  cm) at 1.8 K. These result in ultrahigh-mobility values
of ∼93 000 cm2 V–1 s–1 for pristine Bi2Te3. The extremely
large mobility for Bi2Te3 is in accordance with the high RRR
and large MR value (MR varies quadratically with mobility)
as discussed below.
Figure 2(a) shows magnetoresistance (MR% = [ρxx(H) −
ρxx(0)/ρxx(0)] × 100%) for the PdxBi2Te3 crystals with
magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the sample surface (ab-
plane) as well as the current direction. The low-temperature
(T = 1.8 K) MR values for Bi2Te3 at a ﬁeld of 8 T is
∼1500%, which is larger than the previously reported value
of MR = 540% at 7 T by Shrestha et al. [26,27], MR =
400% at 13 T by Wang et al. [28], at 10 T by Singh et al.
[29], and MR = 267% at 9 T by Barua et al. [30]. With
the increasing Pd content, the MR value decreases signif-
icantly from 1500% (x = 0) to 300% (x = 0.20). As seen
from Fig. 2(a), the MR of PdxBi2Te3 showed a quadratic
dependence on magnetic ﬁelds. Figure 2(b) shows that the
MR value remains almost unchanged up to 10 K, then starts
to decrease upon further increase of temperature. At 200 K,
the MR curves of all Pd concentrations overlap and have
similar values at room temperature. The decrease in MR value
with temperature could also be associated with the increase
in carrier concentration. The MR curves show a parabolic
ﬁeld dependence at higher temperatures as well as with the
increase in Pd content (see Fig. S6 [16]). Generally, high MR
values are realized in semimetals, where electron and hole
pockets coexist at the Fermi level [31]. A large value of MR
and high mobility have been a feature of semimetals such
as bismuth, graphene, zero-gap semiconductors silver chalco-
genides (Ag2+δSe, Ag2+δTe), Dirac and Weyl materials, and
Heusler compounds [31–36]. The linear band dispersion as
revealed by ARPES may results in high mobility, possibly due
to high Fermi velocity of massless particles [37]. Moreover, a
large nonsaturating MR is expected in such systems.

Pd0.05Bi2Te3 with the broad hump shape anomaly around

netic ﬁeld, which is suggestive of the WAL effect. To further
examine the WAL effect, we show magnetoconductance of
Pd0.05Bi2Te3 in Fig. 3. The WAL is a quantum correction to
conductivity resulting from both the strong spin-orbit cou-
pling in the bulk as well as the spin-momentum locking in
the TSSs of TIs [38]. The cusplike positive MR in low ﬁelds
due to the WAL is observed up to 20 K and reduces at high
temperature. The WAL effect is derived from the destruc-
tive interference between two time-reversed electron paths
around an impurity or scattering point. This destructive inter-
ference reduces the elastic backscattering, thereby increasing
the conductivity. We have analyzed the WAL data using the
Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) model [39]:

The prefactor α is expected to be −0.5 for the 2D topologi-
cal surface states of TIs. We have shown the ﬁtting (black line)
of the magnetoconductance curve in the range ±1 T in Fig. 3.
The obtained α values (∼−7) at T = 2.5 K are larger than
the previously reported values in the range −0.4 to −2.5 for
thin ﬁlm as well as bulk samples of TIs [40–44]. Such large
values can also be understood by assuming that some of the
bulk channels also conduct together with the surface states of
TIs. Additionally, the large value of magnetoconductance in
this material is also consistent with the large value of α. The
lφ values (∼97 nm) are comparable to that discussed in the
literature [26].
In the ﬁeld-dependent resistivity of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 and
Pd0.10Bi2Te3, we have observed Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH)
oscillations. The quantum oscillation is an important probe
to analyze the shape and sizes of the Fermi surface as well
as topological properties of carriers. We have observed the
oscillations at low temperatures (1.8–10 K) and magnetic ﬁeld
in the range of 4–8 T. The observed quantum oscillations in
	ρxx for the x = 0.05 and 0.10 samples have been plotted in
Figs. 4(a) and 4(c) as a function of inverse magnetic ﬁeld at
different temperatures (	ρxx has been determined by subtract-
ing the polynomial background from ρxx). The magnitude of
oscillations in Pd0.10Bi2Te3 is larger than that in Pd0.05Bi2Te3.
The amplitude of SdH oscillations decreases with an increase
in temperature due to the thermal damping factor.
In Figs. 4(b) and 4(d), the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
amplitudes for the subtracted oscillations are plotted with
the frequency. The FFT amplitudes of both samples decrease
on increasing temperature. The x = 0.05 sample shows a
prominent peak at the oscillation frequency of F = 2.75 T for
all temperatures, whereas the x = 0.10 sample has a major
peak at F = 4 T for 1.8 K, which gradually shifts to 7.2 T
for higher temperatures. The frequencies of these oscilla-
tions are proportional to the extremal cross section of Fermi
surface [AF = A(EF )] perpendicular to the applied magnetic
ﬁeld, based on the Onsager relation F = ¯h/2πe A(EF). The

Here, ρT is the thermal damping factor and ρD is the Dingle
damping factor, ωc = eH/mc is the cyclotron frequency, and
TD is the Dingle temperature. In the Lifshitz-Kosevich theory,
the thermal smearing of SdH oscillations is determined by
the magnitude of cyclotron mass, mc. As the temperature
increases, the ratio of thermal energy to the cyclotron energy
increases leading to the decrease in amplitude of oscillations.
A ﬁtting to the temperature-dependent SdH oscillation am-
plitude shown in the inset of Figs. 4(a) and 4(c) at a ﬁxed
magnetic ﬁeld H yields the cyclotron mass mc of ∼0.105 me
for both x = 0.05 and 0.10. The effective mass obtained here
is in fair agreement with the reported value ∼0.09me for
undoped Bi2Te3 [27,29,30,45].
The Dingle temperature (TD) is calculated from the ﬁeld
dependence of the SdH oscillation amplitude at a ﬁxed tem-
perature. It yields the same ﬁeld dependence as does the
impurity scattering [46]. The Dingle plot is shown in the
insets of Figs. 4(a) and 4(c), in which ln(	ρxxA sinh αT/H)
against 1/H is plotted, where α = 2π2kBmc/¯he. A straight
line ﬁt to this plot generates a slope that contains the Dingle
temperature, given by −2π2kBmcTD/¯h. From TD, the quantum
scattering lifetime τ for the carriers is calculated based on
the relation ¯h
τ = 2πkBTD. Then, we can further calculate the
surface carrier mobility (μs = eτ/mc = elSdH/¯hkF ) and the
mean free path (lSdH) of the surface carrier. The obtained
lower Dingle temperature value implies weaker impurity scat-
tering, which results in higher quantum mobility [46]. The
calculated surface carrier mobility is less than that calculated
from Hall measurement.
To further study the topological properties of the surface
states, we estimated the Berry phase value from the Landau
level fan diagram, which is given by n = F/2πH + β, where
n is the nth Landau level, F is the SdH oscillation period,
and H is the magnetic ﬁeld. The inset of Figs. 4(b) and 4(d)
shows the Landau level fan diagram plotted as the 1/H po-
sitions of maxima and minima in the background-subtracted
SdH oscillations in resistivity as a function of the integer
values known as Landau indices. The minima in resistivity
correspond to integer values n and the maxima correspond
to n + 1/2. The zeroth Landau level can be extracted from
the linear extrapolation of 1/H = 0, which gives n0 = 0.33
and 0.35 for x = 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. The Berry phase
ϕ = 2πβ is 0, β = 0, for the normal fermions, and π, β = 0.5
for the Dirac fermions with the linear dispersion relation. The
extracted values of n0 in our results are closer to 0.5, indi-
cating that the oscillations arise from the topological surface
states with a ﬁnite contribution from bulk states. Thus, the
analysis of SdH oscillations provides evidence of the nonzero
Berry phase for x = 0.05 and 0.10 samples, which indicates
the existence of the TSSs.

jections. In the case of pristine Bi2Te3, there exist electronlike
conduction bands inside the TSSs for the upper part of the
Dirac cone [6,7]. In this study, pristine Bi2Te3 is apparently
n-type because the Fermi level intersects with the bulk con-
duction band (Fig. S7 [16]); the electronlike conduction band
is compatible with the negative Hall coefﬁcient in the bulk.
It is clearly seen from Figs. 5(b)–5(f) that the initial ad-
dition of Pd into the crystal leads to hole doping of the
entire electronic structure, and both the TSSs and bulk derived
valence states are shifted toward higher energy in a rigid-
band-like manner. The energy shift continues up to x = 0.1
and stops for x ⩾0.10. Note that bulk valence bands cross the
Fermi level for the x ⩾0.1 samples, in agreement with the
positive Hall coefﬁcient in the bulk. It should be noted that
the topological surface state of x = 0.05 is well-isolated from
the bulk band at EF, and the electric transport is governed
by the surface state. On the other hand, for higher compo-
sitions, the bulk valence bands go across EF, indicating that
the contribution of the surface states might be masked by the
bulk carriers in the transport properties. Note that other doped
topological insulators AxBi2Se3 (Sr,Nb,Cu) are reported to
show a downward shift of the Dirac point with an increase
in dopant concentration [47–50]. The position- and time-
dependent ARPES results on x = 0.10 and 0.20 are presented
in the supplemental material (see Figs. S8 and S9 [16]). We
found that the difference in energy is at most ∼8 meV. In the
case of the pristine sample (Bi2Te3), the energy deviation was
below the detection limit. These results indicate the magnitude
of the homogeneity. After 24 h of cleavage, the DP was shifted
to lower energy, likely due to the adsorption of residual gas on
the sample surface.
In Figs. 6(a)–6(c), on moving toward the lower binding
energy (i.e., from the EF to the Dirac point), the shape of
the constant energy contour for Bi2Te3 changes from starlike

to a circle upon decreasing the cross-section area, whereas
for Pd-doped samples it is already a rounded hexagon at EF.
Figure 6(d) shows the surface charge carrier density as a
function of the Pd concentration. The initial Pd doping leads
to a rapid reduction of carrier density of the TSS up to a
value of x = 0.1. After that the TSS density remains es-
sentially unchanged. The saturation of the doping level of
the TSSs above x = 0.1 where the valence-band maximum
(VBM) starts to cross the Fermi level. One can expect a signif-
icant contribution from the bulk valence band for the x ⩾0.1
sample.
To evaluate the kF value, we ﬁt the momentum distribution
curve (MDC) at the Fermi level using the Voigt function (see
Fig. S10 [16]) [51]. As a result, we can estimate the charge

locity (vF) and effective mass (m∗) were determined by using
the formula vF = 1

vF , respectively. We
have also evaluated the linewidth Г = (	E) = ( ∂E
∂k ) × (δk)
and relaxation time τ = ћ
Г using the MDC width δk, which
is a Lorentzian linewidth in the Voigt function (the Gaussian
linewidth represents the instrumental resolution) [51–53]. It
should be noted that the ARPES linewidth at EF is sensitive
to the lattice defects, and the observed linewidths for all our
compositions are among the narrowest for the reported doped
topological insulators [6,18–24]. Table II represents the pa-
rameters obtained for the TSSs only.
IV. DISCUSSION
Now, we compare results obtained from the SdH oscillation
and ARPES measurements. The Fermi wave number obtained
from the SdH oscillation is almost identical for x = 0.05 and
0.10 samples, kF ∼1 × 106 cm–1, and the values are smaller
by a factor of 1/7 (x = 0.05) and 1/4 (x = 0.10) in compar-
ison to that obtained from ARPES results. The reduction in
the kF value obtained from magnetotransport is likely due to
the band bending induced by the Schottky barrier leading to
the shifting of the Fermi level toward the Dirac point. We
assume the band bending is saturated if the valence band
crosses the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 5. Based on the
observed Fermi surfaces by ARPES, one can clearly see that
the Fermi surface area for the Pd-doped samples is reasonably

approximated by AF
= πk2
F. Since the area and surface
carrier density are in proportion to k2
F, the ARPES results yield
values that are 16 (=42) to 49 (=72) times larger compared
with the magnetotransport measurements. On the other hand,
the cyclotron mass, mc ∼0.1me for x = 0.05 and 0.10 sam-
ples, obtained from the SdH oscillation is close to the effective
mass m∗∼0.2me evaluated in the ARPES experiments. We
assume that the effective mass given by SdH and ARPES is
similar in spite of the difference in the kF value because of
the linearity of the band dispersion of the TSSs. Furthermore,
we should note that the mean free path, l = vFτ = 13–15 nm,
obtained from the SdH oscillation is close to the values
l = 1/δk = vFτ = 17–50 nm evaluated from ARPES. As the
Berry phase is closer to π, we assume that the parameters
obtained by the SdH oscillation derive mainly from the TSSs,
while the carrier density is likely reduced due to the band
bending.
It is important to note the difference in these two measure-
ments. While the TSSs on the surface are directly observed
by ARPES, the metal-semiconductor contacts are inevitable
for the transport measurements. The Schottky barrier induces
band bending at the interface, which modiﬁes the energy
position of the Dirac point location in the near surface region
[18,54]. Therefore, the Fermi wave number may be modiﬁed
in the SdH oscillation measurements, and hence the sur-
face carrier density. Furthermore, the SdH oscillation provide
parameters averaged over the Fermi surface, while ARPES
results are along the ¯ −¯M high-symmetry direction. We
should note, however, that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface
shape is reduced for doped samples (x > 0.05). Furthermore,
the ARPES signals are obtained from the beam spot size
of <10 μφ, while SdH oscillation signals are averaged over
∼1 mm2 samples.
V. CONCLUSION
We have presented the effect of Pd doping on the magneto-
transport and electronic properties of Bi2Te3 crystals. We have
shown the evolution of various electronic parameters such as
lifetime and mean free path of carriers at the Fermi level ob-
tained through the ARPES and SdH oscillations studies. The
observation of SdH oscillations, weak antilocalization, and the
nonzero Berry phase in magnetotransport studies clearly in-
dicated the contribution from topologically nontrivial surface
states. The Dirac conelike surface states in ARPES conﬁrm
that PdxBi2Te3 retains its topological properties upon Pd
doping. Hall measurement shows the crossover from n-type
charge carriers in undoped Bi2Te3 to p-type charge carriers
upon Pd doping in the bulk. This is consistent with the ARPES
results, in which both the Dirac cone and bulk derived valence
states are pushed toward the Fermi level upon the addition of
Pd. In addition to the energy shift of the Dirac point, quasi-
particle properties such as the effective mass and the mean
free path are consistent with the SdH oscillation and ARPES
measurements, which are consistent with the linearity of the
band dispersion of the TSS.
