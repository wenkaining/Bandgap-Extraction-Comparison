An elasto-plastic model for concrete, based on a recently-proposed yield surface and simple hardening
laws, is formulated, implemented, numerically tested and validated against available test results. The
yield surface is smooth and particularly suited to represent the behaviour of rock-like materials, such
as concrete, mortar, ceramic and rock. A new class of isotropic hardening laws is proposed, which can
be given both an incremental and the corresponding ﬁnite form. These laws describe a smooth transition
from linear elastic to plastic behaviour, incorporating linear and nonlinear hardening, and may approach
the perfectly plastic limit in the latter case. The reliability of the model is demonstrated by its capability
of correctly describing the results yielded by a number of well documented triaxial tests on concrete sub-
jected to various conﬁnement levels. Thanks to its simplicity, the model turns out to be very robust and
well suited to be used in complex design situations, as those involving dynamic loads.

1. Introduction
The mechanical behaviour of concrete is rather complex – even
under monotonic and quasi-static loading – because of a number of
factors: (i) highly nonlinear and (ii) strongly inelastic response, (iii)
anisotropic and (iv) eventually localized damage accumulation with
(v) stiffness degradation, (vi) contractive and subsequently dilatant
volumetric strain, leading to (vii) progressively severe cracking. This
complexity is the macroscale counterpart of several concurrent
and cooperative or antagonist micromechanisms of damage and
stiffening, as for instance, pore collapse, microfracture opening
and extension or closure, aggregate debonding, and interfacial fric-
tion. It can therefore be understood that the constitutive modelling
of concrete (but also of similar materials such as rock, soil and
ceramic) has been the subject of an impressive research effort,
which, broadly speaking, falls within the realm of elastoplasticity,1
where the term ‘plastic’ is meant to include the damage as a speciﬁc
inelastic mechanism. In fact, elastoplasticity is a theoretical frame-
work allowing the possibility of a phenomenological description of
all the above-mentioned constitutive features of concrete in terms
of: (i) yield function features, (ii) coupling elastic and plastic
deformation, (iii) ﬂow-rule nonassociativity, and (iv) hardening
sources and rules [3]. However, the usual problem arising from a re-
ﬁned constitutive description in terms of elastoplasticity is the com-
plexity of the resulting model, which may lead to several numerical
difﬁculties related to the possible presence of yield surface corners,
discontinuity of hardening, lack of self-adjointness due to nonassoci-
ativity and failure of ellipticity of the rate equations due to strain
softening. As a consequence, reﬁned models often lack numerical
robustness or slow down the numerical integration to a level that
the model becomes of awkward, if not impossible, use. A ‘minimal’
and robust constitutive model, not obsessively accurate but able to
capture the essential phenomena related to the progressive damage
occurring during monotonic loading of concrete, is a necessity to
treat complex load situations.
The essential ‘ingredients’ of a constitutive model are a convex,
smooth yield surface capable of an excellent interpolation of data
and a hardening law describing a smooth transition between elas-
ticity and a perfectly plastic behaviour. Exclusion of strain soften-
ing, together with ﬂow rule associativity, is the key to preserve
ellipticity, and thus well-posedness of the problem. In the present
paper, an elastopalstic model is formulated, based on the so-called
‘BP yield surface’ [3,4,11] which is shown to correctly describe the
damage envelope of concrete, and on an inﬁnite class of isotropic
hardening rules (given both in incremental form and in the
corresponding ﬁnite forms), depending on a hardening parameter.
Within a certain interval for this parameter hardening is un-
bounded (with linear hardening obtained as a limiting case), while
outside this range a smooth hardening/perfectly-plastic transition
is described. The proposed model does not describe certain phe-
nomena which are known to occur in concrete, such as for instance

1 The research on elastoplastic modelling of concrete has reached its apex in the
seventies and eighties of the past century, when so many models have been proposed
that are now hard to even only be summarized (see among others, [2,5,8,15]).
Although nowadays other approaches are preferred, like those based on particle
mechanics [13], the aim of the present article is to formulate a relatively simple and
robust model, something that is difﬁcult to be achieved with advanced models.

2. Elastoplasticity and the constitutive model
This section provides the elastoplastic constitutive model in
terms of incremental equations. The form of the yield surface is
given, depending on the stress invariants and a set of material
parameters. A new class of hardening laws is formulated in order
to describe a smooth transition from linear elastic to plastic
behaviour.
2.1. Incremental constitutive equations
The decomposition of the strain into the elastic (e) and plastic
(p) parts as
 ¼ e þ p
ð1Þ
yields the incremental elastic strain in the form
_e ¼ _  _p:
ð2Þ
The ‘accumulated plastic strain’ is deﬁned as follows:
pa ¼
Z t
0
j _pjds;
ð3Þ
where t is the time-like variable governing the loading increments.
Introducing the ﬂow rule
_p ¼ _kP;
ð4Þ
where P is the gradient of the plastic potential, we obtain that the
rate of the accumulated plastic strain is proportional to the plastic
multiplier (_k P 0) as
_pa ¼ _kjPj:
ð5Þ
A substitution of Eqs. (2) and (4) into the incremental elastic consti-
tutive equation relating the increment of stress _r to the increment
of elastic strain _e through a fourth-order elastic tensor E as _r ¼ E _e,
yields
_r ¼ E _  _kEP:
ð6Þ
Note that, for simplicity, reference is made to isotropic elasticity, so
that the elastic tensor E is deﬁned in terms of elastic modulus E and
Poisson’s ratio m.
During plastic loading, the stress point must satisfy the yield
condition Fðr; kÞ ¼ 0 at every time increment, so that the Prager
consistency can be written as
_F ¼ Q  _r þ @F
@k  _k ¼ 0;
ð7Þ
where Q ¼ @F=@r is the yield function gradient and k is the harden-
ing parameters vector.
By deﬁning the hardening modulus Hðr; kÞ as
@F
@k  _k ¼ _kHðr; kÞ;
ð8Þ
Eq. (7) can be rewritten in the form
Q  _r  _kH ¼ 0
ð9Þ
Further, the plastic multiplier can be obtained from Eqs. (6) and (9)
_k ¼
Q  E _
H þ Q  EP :
ð10Þ
Finally, a substitution of Eqs. (10) into (6) yields the elasto-plastic
constitutive equations in the rate form
_r ¼ E _ 
Q  E _
H þ Q  EP EP;
ð11Þ
where, for simplicity, the associative ﬂow rule P ¼ Q, will be
adopted in the sequel.
2.2. The BP yield surface

BP yield function [4]

ters a and m deﬁne the distortion of the meridian section, while b

2.3. An inﬁnite class of hardening laws
In order to simulate the nonlinear hardening of concrete,
the following class of hardening rules in incremental form is
proposed:
_pc ¼

ð17Þ
_c ¼ X _pc;
ð18Þ
where
four

have
been
introduced:

Eqs. (17) and (18) can be integrated in order to obtain the hardening
laws in ﬁnite form as follows

In order to gain insight on the physical meaning of the proposed
class of hardening rules, let us consider the asymptotic behaviour
of the ﬁnite form (21) as pa ! 0, which turns out to be independent
of the parameters d and n and is given by the formula
pc ¼ pc0 þ k1pa þ Oðp2
aÞ:
ð23Þ
This formula shows that, at an early stage of plastic deformation,
the hardening is linear with a slope governed by the parameter k1.
On the other hand, the hardening at a later stage of plastic
deformation is governed by the parameters d and n. This is made
clear by considering the asymptotic behaviour of the ﬁnite form
(21) as pa ! 1:

With the deﬁnition of the hardening law, the proposed elastoplastic
constitutive model is ready to be calibrated, implemented and
tested, which is the subject of the following Sections, where two
members of the class of hardening laws will be analyzed, namely,
n ¼ 1 and n ¼ 2, the former corresponding to the logarithmic
growth of hardening and the latter approaching the perfectly plastic
behaviour.
3. Calibration of material parameters and comparison with
experimental results
3.1. Calibration of the BP yield surface
The BP yield surface has been calibrated on the basis of avail-
able experiments [6,7,9,10,14], to model the behaviour of concrete
in the p–q plane (Fig. 2) and in the biaxial r1=fc–r2=fc plane (Fig. 3),
where fc (taken positive) deﬁnes the failure for compressive uniax-
ial stress. We have assumed a ratio between fc and the failure
stress in uniaxial tension ft equal to 10. The parameter values
which have been found to provide the better interpolation of
experimental data for the three concretes (identiﬁed by their uni-
axial compressive strengths fc ¼ 31:7 MPa, fc ¼ 46:9 MPa, and
fc ¼ 62:1 MPa) reported by [7] are given in Table 1.
3.2. A validation of the model against triaxial tests
The above-presented constitutive model has been implemented
in a UMAT routine of ABAQUS Standard Ver. 6.11 [1].
Triaxial compression tests at high pressure on cylindrical
concrete specimen (experimental data taken from [7]) have been
simulated using two different hardening laws of the class (17)–
(18), namely n ¼ 1, corresponding to logarithmic hardening, and
n ¼ 2, which provides a smooth transition to perfect plasticity.
The values of parameters (identifying elastic behaviour and hard-
ening) used in the simulations are reported in Table 2.
Results of the numerical simulations (one axisymmetric biqua-
dratic ﬁnite element with eight nodes – so called ‘CAX8 ’– has been
employed) are presented in Figs. 4–6 , reporting the axial stress r11
plotted in terms of axial 11 and radial 22 strains. The three ﬁgures

83refer to the three different concretes, identiﬁed by their different
uniaxial compressive strength. Different colours2 of the lines de-
note simulations performed at different conﬁning pressure, namely:
{19, 24, 44} MPa for Fig. 4, {18, 35, 51, 70} MPa for Fig. 5, and {14, 35,
69} MPa for Fig. 6.
The solid lines correspond to the logarithmic hardening laws
(21) and (22) with n ¼ 1. The dashed lines correspond to the hard-
ening laws (21) and (22) with n ¼ 2.
It is clear from the ﬁgures that both the hardening laws perform
correctly, but the hardening rule with n ¼ 1 leads to a more stable
numerical behaviour, while with n ¼ 2 failure can be approached.
4. Conclusions
A reasonably simple inelastic model for concrete has been for-
mulated on the basis of a recently-proposed yield function and a
class of hardening rules, which may describe a smooth transition
from linear elastic to perfectly plastic behaviour. The model has
been implemented into a numerical routine and successfully vali-
dated against available triaxial experiments at different conﬁning
pressures. Although the presented constitutive approach cannot
compete in accuracy with more sophisticated models, it has been
proven to be robust for numerical calculations, so that it results par-
ticularly suitable for complex design situations where easy of cali-
bration, fast convergence and stability become important factors.
