ABSTRACT
We employ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the spin probe
Mn2þ
to
study
the
paraelectric  ferroelectric
transition
in
Dimethylammonium Manganese Formate (DMMnF) and Mn2þ-doped
Dimethylammonium Zinc Formate (DMZnF), which are considered
model metal  organic frameworks (MOF) with a Pb-free perovskite
architecture. In DMMnF, we study the variation of the Mn2þ EPR line
shape and intensity at the X-band (9.4 GHz) and over 80 to 300 K,
and we show the absence of magnetoelectric coupling at the ferro-
electric transition. At the antiferromagnetic transition in DMMnF, we
detect a magnetoelectric coupling caused by weak ferromagnetism
in the AFM phase. In DMZnF, EPR spectra of the Mn2þ probe com-
bined with DFT show that the crystal field is predominantly deter-
mined by the Dimethylammonium (DMAþ) cations.

Introduction
Multiferroics exhibiting simultaneous magnetic and electric ordering offer the possibility
of magnetoelectric coupling, which is the electric control of magnetization or magnetic
control of dielectric polarization [1, 2]. However, reports of magnetoelectric coupling
are rare even for single-phase inorganic materials, [3] which have been extensively
researched for several decades. Perovskite-like metal formates with the general formula
ABX3 are a class of metal  organic frameworks (MOFs) that have received extensive
research interest for their ferroelectric and multiferroic properties [3–21].
Dimethylammonium zinc formate, [(CH3)2NH2]Zn(HCOO)3 (DMZnF), and dimethy-
lammonium manganese formate [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3 (DMMnF) are good proto-
types of perovskite-like metal formates and have been studied in detail. DMMnF was
the first reported multiferroic metal-organic framework with the perovskite architecture
[7]. DMZnF and DMMnF exhibit a ferroelectric transition at Tc¼ 156K and 185K,
respectively, accompanied by a structural phase transition [6, 7]. Figure 1 shows the iso-
morphic crystal structure of DMMeF (Me ¼ Mn, Zn) in the high-temperature (paraelec-
tric) phase [6, 7]. In the paraelectric phase, the DMAþ cation undergoes hindered
rotation, with the nitrogen disordered over three equivalent positions. Electron

https://doi.org/10.1080/00150193.2018.1473484paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is the tool of choice for probing the dynamics of phase
transitions. The EPR spectra of Mn2þ-doped DMZnF (DMZnF:Mn2þ)are very sensitive
to the crystal field modification induced during the ferro/paraelectric phase transition.
In DMMnF, the correlation between Mn2þ ions is strong enough to create antiferro-
magnetic order below TN¼8 K. Additionally, magnetic correlation is known to hide
some spectral properties even in the paramagnetic phase. For example, the 30 EPR lines
(caused by splitting of each of the 5 electron spin lines into 6 hyperfine lines) expected
for Mn2þ are blurred into a single line due to exchange correlation. Even in this case,
EPR is sensitive enough to provide information on the coupling between ferroelectric
and magnetic order [18].
In this paper, we show how the motion of the DMAþ cation can be directly probed
by EPR of DMZnF:Mn2þ. Further, we show that the ferroelectric transition in DMMnF
is not accompanied by magnetoelectric coupling, in contrast to what has been suggested
before [12]. Finally, we observe weak
ferromagnetic/ferroelectric coupling when
DMMnF enters the antiferromagnetic phase.
Experimental details
Synthesis
Dimethylammonium manganese formate, DMMnF, was synthesized using a standard
solvothermal synthetic procedure, described in previous reports [4]. Briefly, 1 mmol of
MnCl24H2O was dissolved in a solution consisting of 6 mL dimethylformamide and
6 mL deionized water. The solution was heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 140 C for
Figure 1. Crystal structure of DMMeF (Me ¼ Mn, Zn) at T > Tc (paraelectric phase). The metal (Zn or
Mn) ions are at the center of the oxygen octahedron (red). In DMMnF (DMZnF) all (most) the oxygen
octahedron are filled with a Mn ion. In DMZnF dopped by Mn, one Zn2þ ion is substituted by a
Mn2þ ion (pink sphere in the middle). The 3 possible positions of the nitrogen in DMAþ are repre-
sented in blue, green, and yellow. At T > Tc, the DMA þ is disordered between these 3 equivalent
positions. At TTc, the symmetry group change, the DMA± (green) points in the same direction and
the system becomes ferro elastic and ferroelectric. Carbon are in black and protons are omitted

crystals with dimensions of 1-5 mm after 3-5 days. Crystals of DMZnF:Mn2þ were syn-
thesized by the same method, using a Zn:Mn mole ratio of 1:400 in the initial reaction
mixture. This supernatant yielded block single crystals with dimensions of 1-5 mm after
15-20 days. Sample authenticity was verified by X-ray diffraction as well as EPR
spectroscopy.
EPR
EPR experiments were performed using a conventional X-band Bruker EMX spectrometer
operating at about 9.4 GHz and between 4.5 K and 300 K. A small amount of DPPH was
used as a reference, in order to avoid intensity artifacts due to variation of the Q factor of
the cavity. Magnetic field modulation associated with lock-in detection was employed,
resulting in the derivative of the signal. All measurements were carried out with the static
field H perpendicular to the (012) face of the crystal. All the recorded spectra can be fit-
ted by the derivative of a Lorentzian. Simultaneous fits of the DMMnF signal and DPPH
signal yield the intensity, linewidth, and resonance field with high accuracy, and ensure
removal of unwanted effects of cavity-related background signals.
Results and discussion
Origin of the crystal field in DMZnF:Mn21
Figure 2 shows the EPR signal of Mn2þ in DMZnF for temperatures just above and
below the ferroelectric phase transition. The spectrum consists of 6 allowed DSz¼ ±1
(Sz¼–1/2 to 1/2) transitions and 10 forbidden DSz¼ ±1, DIz¼ ±1 transitions. The other

the ferroelectric phase transition (Tc ¼150K). For T > Tc, only the -1/2-to-þ1/20 transitions with
DMI ¼ 0 (allowed transitions) and 1 (forbidden transitions) are seen. The other transitions are too
broad to be resolved. Below Tc, the linewidths of all the lines decrease. The -1/2-to-þ1/20 transitions
are now sharper and the ±5/2 to ±3/2 and ±3/2 to ±1/2 transitions can be resolved.
FERROELECTRICS
13/[211]allowed transitions (Sz¼ ±5/2 to ±3/2 and Sz¼ ±3/2 to ±1/2) are not resolved due to a
large crystal field strain. Note that rotation of the crystal does not change the line-
shape dramatically. Below Tc, the EPR spectra become much more complex. The
Sz¼–1/2 to 1/2 transitions are sharper and the Sz¼ ±5/2 to ±3/2 and Sz¼ ±3/2 to ±1/2
transitions can now be resolved, leading to 30 allowed lines. Moreover, in this phase,
the system possesses three kinds of domains corresponding to the three orientations of
DMAþ, which leads to 90 allowed lines. For T > Tc, the spectrum is rather simple to
simulate using the Easyspin module in Matlab. We obtained an axial crystal field
anisotropy with D ¼ 250MHz while a very large distribution of D, DD ¼ 150 MHz, was
needed to simulate the linewidth and global shape of the signal. This value of DD can-
not be explained by a standard local strain, which is usually a perturbation. To explain
this value, it is useful to remember that the Mn2þ spin is surrounded by 8 nearest-
neighbor DMAþ cations (Figure 1). If the timescale of the measurement is fast
enough, the DMA± ions appear to be frozen in one configuration. In the HT phase,
there are 3 equivalent positions for each DMAþ. Thus, the 8 DMAþ cations surround-
ing the Mn2þ spin can each occupy 3 independent positions, giving 38 ¼ 6561 possible
configurations. In the rigid limit, the EPR measurement provides a simultaneous
“picture” of all the configurations.
Using quantum chemical methods based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), we
have estimated the zero-field splitting (ZFS) of some of these configurations. It is
obviously not possible to test all 6561 configurations but a dozen of them were ran-
domly selected and sampled by DFT calculations. Following a previously reported
approach [23], we used minimal models based on X-ray crystallographic measure-
ments and consisting of one hexaformato Mn(II) complex surrounded by 8 DMAþ
cations. Here we assume that the ZFS of the system arises mainly from the first and
second coordination spheres of the metal ion, i.e. the formate ligands and the DMAþ
ions. The distribution of the ZFS parameter was found to be DDDFT125 MHz, which
is in rather good agreement with the experimental estimation. Moreover, this result
proves that the crystal field variation is determined by the DMAþ cations. For
T < Tc, DD ¼ 15 MHz, which is a much more typical value for dilute systems. In this
phase, the DMAþ cations are cooperatively ordered, inducing the ferroelectric phase.
Each Mn2þ sees the same DMAþ configuration and the distribution of crystal fields
is greatly narrowed.
Absence of magnetoelectric coupling at TC in DMMnF
In DMMnF, magnetic correlation plays an important role and magnetoelectric coupling
could appear in the ferroelectric phase.
Temperature-dependence of the EPR of DMMnF was observed in the range from 300
K down to 80 K, with closer data points acquired near the structural phase transition
(TC  185 K). Figure 3 shows a series of spectra near TC, obtained in 10 K intervals
from T ¼ 210 K to T ¼ 160 K. The sharp peak is due to the DPPH reference. There is a
small but clear jump in the height of the DMMnF signal when TC is crossed.
The spectra were fit using the derivative of a Lorentzian, and the line width, reson-
ance field, and normalized intensity were extracted from the fits. The parameter of
14/[212]
N. ABHYANKAR ET AL.interest for probing magnetoelectric coupling is the variation of the EPR intensity,
which is proportional to the static susceptibility. The susceptibility obtained by EPR
(Figure 4) shows no abrupt change when the temperature crosses TC, indicating the
absence of a magnetoelectric effect. The jump in the height of the EPR spectra is a
consequence of the change in linewidth and can be attributed neither to a magneto-
electric nor a magneto-structural effect [21]. This jump is an indirect effect of the
change of the EPR linewidth but has no physical meaning related to magnetoelec-
tric coupling.
Figure 3. Comparison of X-band spectra of a DMMnF single crystal in a range of temperatures above
and below TC (185 K). The small sharp line in the middle is due to the internal standard DPPH. As
such, while this observation is in accord with those of Wang et al., [12] additional studies after double
integration showed no jump in the overall signal intensity.

15/[213]Evidence of coupling between ferroelectric and weak ferromagnetic orders
Finally, we focus on the second transition of DMMnF, which is the antiferromagnetic
ordering at TN<8.5 K. At temperatures well above TN, the spectrum observed is an
EPR line (Figure 5). When the temperature is decreased and approaches TN, the line-
width increases and should diverge at T ¼ TN. Below this temperature, antiferromagnetic
resonance (AFMR) lines appear; and these are shifted from the paramagnetic line pos-
ition because of the internal field. This is the standard behavior of antiferromagnetic
systems. However, here we can see that the line is quite convoluted near TN. At T ¼ 10
K, the line is Lorentzian with a very good signal-to-noise ratio. However, as the tem-
perature is decreased, the signal quality deteriorates due to the appearance of many
small peaks of high intensity. This effect is maximum at T ¼ TN, and decreases before
disappearing at 4.5 K. This effect is due to the interference of the electromagnetic wave
inside the crystal, which acts like an interferometer. Usually, this effect is observed at
very high frequencies and for large crystals. It appears when k(erlr)1/2¼c/f, where k is

due to the presence of weak ferromagnetism (canted antiferromagnetism) in the
AFM phase.
Conclusion
We have shown how EPR can be used to probe the electric and magnetic properties of
MOFs. Using the ferroelectric DMZnF lightly doped with Mn2þ, we have shown that
the DMAþ cations are dynamic, and this dynamic nature is the origin of the crystal
field distribution in the sample. Using the purely magnetic DMMnF system, we have
shown the absence of magnetoelectric coupling at Tc and the presence of magnetoelec-
tric coupling through weak ferromagnetism in the antiferromagnetic phase.
