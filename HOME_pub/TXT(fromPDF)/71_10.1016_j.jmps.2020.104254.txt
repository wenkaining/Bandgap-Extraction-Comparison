We present a new theoretical and numerical framework for modelling mechanically-assisted
corrosion in elastic‚Äìplastic solids. Both pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can be
captured, as well as the pit-to-crack transition. Localised corrosion is assumed to be dissolution-
driven and a formulation grounded upon the film rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation mechanism
is presented to incorporate the influence of film passivation. The model incorporates, for the
first time, the role of mechanical straining as the electrochemical driving force, accelerating
corrosion kinetics. The computational complexities associated with tracking the evolving metal‚Äì
electrolyte interface are resolved by making use of a phase field paradigm, enabling an
accurate approximation of complex SCC morphologies. The coupled electro-chemo-mechanical
formulation is numerically implemented using the finite element method and an implicit
time integration scheme; displacements, phase field order parameter and concentration are
the primary variables. Five case studies of particular interest are addressed to showcase the
predictive capabilities of the model, revealing an excellent agreement with analytical solutions
and experimental measurements. By modelling these paradigmatic 2D and 3D boundary value
problems we show that our formulation can capture: (i) the transition from activation-controlled
corrosion to diffusion-controlled corrosion, (ii) the sensitivity of interface kinetics to mechanical
stresses and strains, (iii) the role of film passivation in reducing corrosion rates, and (iv) the
dependence of the stability of the passive film to local strain rates. The influence of these factors
in driving the shape change of SCC defects, including the pit-to-crack transition, is a natural
outcome of the model, laying the foundations for a mechanistic assessment of engineering
materials and structures.
1. Introduction
The reliability and structural integrity of materials are generally governed by their interaction with the environment and the
multi-physics phenomena resulting from those interactions. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is one of these phenomena, arguably
the most common yet complex failure mechanism of engineering structures and components (Turnbull, 2001). SCC involves the
propagation of cracks due to the combined action of mechanical stresses and the environment. It is often facilitated by pre-
existing defects, such as corrosion pits, and takes place in a broad range of metallic materials and environments (Raja and Shoji,
2011). However, and despite decades of intensive research, the underlying physical mechanisms governing SCC are still not well
understood (Turnbull, 1993; Crane and Gangloff, 2016). A number of mechanistic interpretations have been presented, and models

can be classified into two categories. The first one refers to models and mechanisms where crack propagation is driven by the anodic
corrosion reaction at the crack tip, including the active path dissolution model (Parkins, 1996) or models grounded on the film
rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation (FRDR) mechanism (Scully, 1975, 1980; Andresen and Ford, 1988). The second category includes
models where crack growth is cathodic-driven and associated with the ingress and transport of hydrogen, such as the hydrogen-
enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism (Oriani, 1972; Serebrinsky et al., 2004; Kristensen et al., 2020), hydrogen enhanced
localised plasticity (HELP) (Sofronis and Birnbaum, 1995) or adsorption-induced dislocation emission (AIDE) (Lynch, 1988). The
characteristics of SCC can vary significantly from one material to another, or even between different environments within the same
material, hindering a critical evaluation of the different mechanistic interpretations. Moreover, many of these mechanisms are not
mutually exclusive and could be acting in concert.
The development of predictive models for SCC is not only hindered by the complexity of the physical picture but also
by the challenges associated with encapsulating into a numerical framework the different physics of the problem (diffusion,
electrochemistry, mechanics). It is particularly challenging from a mathematical and computational perspective to capture how
the metal‚Äìelectrolyte interface evolves over time. SCC failures typically involve the growth of multiple pits, a pit-to-crack transition
stage and the propagation of one or multiple cracks (Larrosa et al., 2018). Capturing the complex morphologies resulting from this
three-stage process is not an easy task and typically requires defining moving interfacial boundary conditions and manually adjusting
the interface topology with arbitrary criteria when merging or division occurs. Numerical methods have been developed to capture
the moving boundary problem of localised corrosion; these include the eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) (Duddu et al.,
2016), Arbitrary Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian (ALE) techniques (Sun et al., 2014) and peridynamics (Chen and Bobaru, 2015). However,
progress is often limited by the inability to deal with arbitrary 3D geometries, cumbersome implementations or the computational
cost. An alternative approach is the use of the phase field method, which is revolutionising the modelling of moving boundaries and
interfacial problems. In the phase field paradigm, the boundary conditions at an interface are replaced by a differential equation for
the evolution of an auxiliary (phase) field ùúô. This phase field takes two distinct values in each of the phases (e.g., 0 and 1), with a
smooth change between both values in a diffuse region near the interface. The problem can then be solved by integrating a set of
partial differential equations for the whole system, thus avoiding the explicit treatment of the interface conditions. First proposed
in the context of solidification and micro-structure evolution, phase field methods are finding ever-expanding applications (Biner,
2017), including areas such as fracture mechanics (Bourdin et al., 2000; Tann√© et al., 2018; Hirshikesh et al., 2019) or fatigue
damage (Lo et al., 2019; Carrara et al., 2020; Kristensen and Mart√≠nez-Pa√±eda, 2020). Very recently, phase field models have been
developed for environmentally-assisted material degradation, including the propagation of cracks assisted by hydrogen (Mart√≠nez-
Pa√±eda et al., 2018; Anand et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020) and the evolution of the aqueous electrolyte‚Äìmetal interface due to material
dissolution (St√•hle and Hansen, 2015; Mai et al., 2016; Mai and Soghrati, 2017; Toshniwal, 2019; Gao et al., 2020). In addition,
recent works have coupled the concepts of phase field evolution due to fracture and material dissolution (Nguyen et al., 2017a,b,
2018).
In this work, we develop a new phase field formulation for simulating pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. The model
builds upon the FRDR mechanism and incorporates the role of mechanics in driving interface kinetics and local film breakage. The
predictive capabilities of the model are demonstrated by addressing a number of relevant 2D and 3D problems, including several
for which analytical or experimental data exist - a remarkable agreement is observed. The remainder of this manuscript is organised
as follows. The theoretical framework presented is described in Section 2. Details of the finite element implementation are given in
Section 3. In Section 4 model predictions are benchmarked against analytical solutions and relevant experimental measurements;
practical case studies are also addressed to demonstrate the ability of the model in tackling complex engineering problems. Finally,
concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
2. Theory
In this Section we formulate our coupled deformation‚Äìdiffusion-material dissolution theory. First, the key mechanistic assump-
tions are presented. We proceed then to develop our theory using the principle of virtual work. Subsequently, the governing
equations for our theory are formulated, as dictated by the coupled field equations, the free-energy imbalance and a set of
thermodynamically-consistent constitutive equations.
2.1. Phase field FRDR model
Our formulation aims at capturing the process of film rupture, dissolution and repassivation. Metals and alloys exposed to
conditions of passivation are protected by a nm-size impermeable film of metal oxides and hydroxides that effectively isolates
the material from the corrosive environment (Macdonald, 1999). Independently of the specific cracking mechanism, film-rupture is
a necessary condition for localised damage in these conditions. Also, a potential rationale for pitting corrosion and stress corrosion
cracking is the rupture of the film due to mechanical straining, followed by localised dissolution of the metal (Scully, 1980; Jivkov,
2004). Repassivation follows each local film rupture event, with the new film being deposited on the bare metal under zero-strain
conditions. Further input of mechanical work is thus needed to fracture the new film, in a cyclic process governed by the competition
between filming and mechanical straining kinetics.
As sketched in Fig. 1, the enhanced corrosion protection resulting from the development of a passive film is characterised by a
drop in the corrosion current density ùëñ, relative to the corrosion current density associated with bare metal ùëñ0. After a drop time ùë°ùëì,
a film rupture event takes place and the bare metal current density ùëñ0 is immediately recovered. This is followed by a time intervalJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

ùë°0, during which the current flows before decay begins, such that ùë°ùëñ= ùë°0 + ùë°ùëìrepresents one film rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation
cycle. Following common assumptions in the literature (Parkins, 1987), the mechanical work required to achieve film rupture can
be characterised using an effective plastic strain quantity, ùúÄùëù, such that film rupture will take place when the accumulation of the
effective plastic strain over a FRDR interval ùúÄùëù
ùëñequals a critical quantity:
ùúÄùëù
ùëñ= ùúÄùëì

(1)
where ÃáùúÄùëùis the effective plastic strain rate and ùúÄùëìis the critical strain for film rupture, which is on the order of 0.1% (Gutman,
2007). Thus, the duration of each film rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation cycle, and the magnitude of ùë°ùëì, will be dictated by the
local values of the equivalent plastic strain and their evolution in time. We proceed to define the degradation of the current density
as an exponential function of the time. Thus, during one rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation cycle, ùëñ(ùë°ùëñ) can be expressed as:
ùëñ(ùë°ùëñ) =
{
ùëñ0,
if
0 < ùë°ùëñ‚©Ωùë°0
ùëñ0 exp (‚àíùëò(ùë°ùëñ‚àíùë°0
)),
if ùë°0 < ùë°ùëñ‚©Ωùë°0 + ùë°ùëì
(2)
where ùëòis a parameter that characterises the sensitivity of the corrosion rates to the stability of the passive film, as dictated by the
material and the environment.
The role of mechanical stresses and strains is typically restricted to the film rupture event. However, we here consider recent
experimental evidence that suggests a further influence of mechanical straining, accelerating corrosion. For example, in Dai et al.
(2020) localised corrosion is observed in Q345R steel despite the negligible effect of the passive film in the hydrofluoric acid
environment considered. Also, as pointed out by Gutman (2007), localised corrosion rates can be notably accelerated by the influence
of residual stresses. Thus, we enhance the definition of the corrosion current density by considering a mechanochemical term
ùëòm (Gutman, 1998) as:
ùëñùëé(ùë°) = ùëòm
(ùúÄùëù, ùúé‚Ñé
) ùëñ(ùë°ùëñ) =
(

)
exp
(ùúé‚Ñéùëâùëö
ùëÖùëá
)
ùëñ(ùë°ùëñ)
(3)
where ùëñùëéis the mechanochemical corrosion current density, ùúÄùëùis the effective plastic strain, ùúÄùë¶is the yield strain, ùúé‚Ñéis the hydrostatic
stress, ùëâùëöis the molar volume, ùëÖis the gas constant, and ùëáis the absolute temperature. We emphasise that ùëòm is a local variable,
a function of the local ùúÄùëùand ùúé‚Ñémagnitudes.
Localised corrosion can be diffusion-controlled or activation-controlled. In the latter, the velocity of the moving pit boundary ùõ§
follows Faraday‚Äôs second law,
ùë£ùëõ= ùíó‚ãÖùêß=
ùëñùëé
ùëßùêπùëêsolid
(4)
where ùêßis the unit normal vector to the pit interface, ùêπis Faraday‚Äôs constant, ùëßis the average charge number and ùëêsolid is the
concentration of atoms in the metal. Then, the concentration of dissolved ions ùëêm(ùê±, ùë°) at a point ùê±in the interface can be calculated
according to the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot condition as,
[ùê∑‚àáùëêm + (ùëêm(ùê±, ùë°) ‚àíùëêsolid
) ùíó] ‚ãÖùêß= 0
(5)
where ùê∑is the diffusion coefficient.
On the other hand, corrosion becomes diffusion controlled when the surface concentration reaches the saturation concentration
ùëêsat, due to the accumulation of metal ions along the pit boundary. The pit interface velocity becomes then controlled by the
diffusion of metal ions away from the pit boundary and the moving pit boundary velocity can be obtained by considering a saturated
concentration in (5), such that

(ùúô= 1), and the interface ùõ§at a time ùë°.
Modelling the moving pit interface requires the application of both Robin (5) and Dirichlet (ùëêm = ùëêsat) boundary conditions for
the activation-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. Instead, we circumvent these complications by following
the phase field paradigm proposed by Mai et al. (2016), approximating the interface evolution implicitly by solving for an auxiliary
variable ùúô. As shown in Fig. 2, the phase field takes values of ùúô= 0 for the electrolyte and ùúô= 1 for the metal, varying smoothly
between these two values along the interface ùõ§. Also, for consistency, a normalised concentration is defined as ùëê= ùëêm‚àïùëêsolid (Mai
et al., 2016). Thus, the normalised concentration ùëêwill equal 1 in the metal (solid) phase, and will approach 0 with increasing
distance from the metal‚Äìelectrolyte interface.
2.2. Principle of virtual work and balance equations
Our theory deals with the coupled behaviour of two systems, one mechanical and one electrochemical, see Fig. 2. These two
systems are coupled by the following physical phenomena: (i) the pit evolution process is accelerated by mechanics, as presented
in Eqs. (2) and (3); and (ii) the dissolution of metals leads to a redistribution of mechanical stress. With respect to the mechanical
contributions, the outer surface of the body is decomposed into a part ùúïùõ∫ùë¢, where the displacement can be prescribed by Dirichlet-
type boundary conditions, and a part ùúïùõ∫ùëá, where a traction ùëªcan be prescribed by Neumann-type boundary conditions. As for
the electrochemical part, the external surface consists on two parts: ùúïùõ∫ùëûwhere the flux ùë±is known (Neumman-type boundary
conditions), and ùúïùõ∫ùëê, where the concentration is prescribed (Dirichlet-type boundary conditions). Accordingly, a concentration flux
entering the body across ùúïùõ∫ùëûcan be defined as ùëû= ùë±‚ãÖùíè. Solute diffusion is driven by the chemical potential ùúá, as constitutively
characterised below. We follow Duda et al. (2018) in defining a scalar field ùúÇto determine the kinematics of composition changes,
such that
ÃáùúÇ= ùúá
and
ùúÇ(ùê±, ùë°) = ‚à´

ùúá(ùê±, ùë°) dùë°
(7)
Thus, from a kinematic viewpoint, the domain ùõ∫can be described by the displacement ùíñ, phase field order parameter ùúôand
chemical displacement ùúÇ. We denote the set of virtual fields as (ùõøùíñ, ùõøùúô, ùõøùúÇ) and proceed to introduce the principle of virtual work
for the coupled systems as,

where ùú∫is the strain tensor, which is computed from the displacement field in the usual manner ùú∫= sym‚àáùíñand additively
decomposes into an elastic part ùú∫ùëíand a plastic part ùú∫ùëù. Also, we use ùêøto denote the interface kinetics coefficient, ùëìis the phase
field microtraction and ùúîand ùúªare the microstress quantities work conjugate to the phase field ùúôand the phase field gradient ‚àáùúô,

imbalances associated with the mechanical and electrochemical systems can be obtained by assuming an isothermal process (ùëá= ùëá0)
and replacing the virtual fields (ùõøùíñ, ùõøùúô, ùõøùúÇ) by the realisable velocity fields ( Ãáùíñ, Ãáùúô, ùúá) in Eq. (8),

2.4. Constitutive theory
We proceed to define the functional form of free energy of each system and subsequently derive a set of thermodynamically
consistent relations.
2.4.1. Constitutive prescriptions for the mechanical problem
The mechanical behaviour of the solid is characterised by von Mises J2 plasticity theory. The extension to strain gradient
plasticity (Mart√≠nez-Pa√±eda and Fleck, 2019; Mart√≠nez-Pa√±eda et al., 2019), of particular importance when dealing with sharp pits
and cracks, will be addressed in future works. Accordingly, the mechanical free energy is decomposed into elastic ùúìùëíand plastic
ùúìùëùcomponents, both of which are degraded by the phase field,
ùúìùëÄ= ‚Ñé(ùúô) (ùúìùëí+ ùúìùëù)
(17)
Here, ‚Ñé(ùúô) is the degradation function characterising the transition from the undissolved solid (ùúô= 1) to the electrolyte phase
(ùúô= 0). The definition of ‚Ñé(ùúô) must satisfy the conditions ‚Ñé(ùúô= 0) = 0 and ‚Ñé(ùúô= 1) = 1; here,
‚Ñé(ùúô) = ‚àí2ùúô3 + 3ùúô2
(18)
Consistent with (15), the Cauchy stress tensor is defined as ùùà= ùúïùú∫ùúìùëÄand we denote ùùà0 as the Cauchy stress tensor for the
undissolved solid. Thus, accounting for the influence of the phase field and using ùùà0, the mechanical force balance (10a) can be
reformulated as,
‚àá‚ãÖ[
(‚Ñé(ùúô) + ùúÖ) ùùàùüé
] = ùüé
(19)
where ùúÖis a small positive parameter introduced to circumvent the complete degradation of the energy and ensure that the algebraic
conditioning number remains well-posed. We adopt ùúÖ= 1 √ó 10‚àí7 throughout this work.Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

C. Cui et al.
The elastic strain energy density is defined as a function of the elastic strains ùú∫ùëíand the linear elastic stiffness matrix ùë™0 in the
usual manner,
ùúìùëí(ùú∫ùëí) = 1
2 (ùú∫ùëí)ùëá‚à∂ùë™0 ‚à∂ùú∫ùëí
(20)
While the plastic strain energy density is incrementally computed from the plastic strain tensor ùú∫ùëùand the Cauchy stress tensor for
the undissolved solid ùùà0 as,
ùúìùëù= ‚à´
ùë°
0
ùùà0 ‚à∂Ãáùú∫ùëùdùë°
(21)
Finally, the material work hardening is defined assuming an isotropic power law hardening behaviour. Such that the flow stress
ùúéand the effective plastic strain ùúÄùëùare related by,
ùúé= ùúéùë¶
(
1 + ùê∏ùúÄùëù
ùúéùë¶
)ùëÅ
(22)
where ùê∏is Young‚Äôs modulus, ùúéùë¶is the yield stress and ùëÅis the strain hardening exponent (0 ‚©ΩùëÅ‚©Ω1).
2.4.2. Constitutive prescriptions for the electrochemical problem
In the localised corrosion system described in Section 1, the electrochemical free energy density ùúìùê∏can be decomposed into its
chemical and interface counterparts,
ùúìùê∏= ùúìùëê‚Ñé+ ùúìùëñ
(23)
The chemical free energy density ùúìùëê‚Ñécan be further decomposed into the energy associated with material composition and a
double-well potential energy (Mai et al., 2016), such that
ùúìùëê‚Ñé= ‚Ñé(ùúô) ùúìùëê‚Ñé
S + (1 ‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)) ùúìùëê‚Ñé
L + ùë§ùëî(ùúô)
(24)
where the parameter ùë§is the height of the double well potential ùëî(ùúô) = ùúô2(1 ‚àíùúô)2, and ùúìùëê‚Ñé
S
and ùúìùëê‚Ñé
L
denote the chemical free
energy density terms associated with the solid and liquid phases, respectively. These latter two terms are defined following the
KKS model (Kim et al., 1999), which assumes that each material point is a mixture of both solid and liquid phases with different
concentrations but similar chemical potentials. Following this assumption, one reaches the following balances
ùëê= ‚Ñé(ùúô) ùëêS + [1 ‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)] ùëêL

(26)
where ùëêS and ùëêL are the normalised concentrations of the co-existing solid and liquid phases, respectively. Defining a free energy
density curvature ùê¥, assumed to be similar for the solid and liquid phases, and restricting our attention to dilute solutions, we reach
the following definitions for each component of the chemical free energy density,
ùúìùëê‚Ñé
S = ùê¥(ùëêS ‚àíùëêSe)2
and
ùúìùëê‚Ñé
L = ùê¥(ùëêL ‚àíùëêLe)2
(27)
where ùëêSe = ùëêsolid‚àïùëêsolid = 1 and ùëêLe = ùëêsat‚àïùëêsolid are the normalised equilibrium concentrations for the solid and liquid phases.
Combining Eqs. (24)‚Äì(27) renders,
ùúìùëê‚Ñé= ùê¥[ùëê‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)(ùëêSe ‚àíùëêLe) ‚àíùëêLe
]2 + ùë§ùúô2 (1 ‚àíùúô)2
(28)
On the other hand, the interface free energy density ùúìùëñis defined as a function of the gradient of the phase field variable as:
ùúìùëñ= ùõº
2 |‚àáùúô|2
(29)
where ùõºis the gradient energy coefficient. In the free energy density definitions (28)‚Äì(29), the parameters ùõºand ùë§govern the
interface energy ùõæand its thickness ùëôas:
ùõæ=

and
ùëô= ùëé‚àó

(30)
where ùëé‚àó= 2.94 is a constant parameter corresponding to the definition of the interface region 0.05 < ùúô< 0.95 (Abubakar et al.,
2015). The results are sensitive to the choices of ùõæand ùëô, which characterise the energy barrier that separates the free energy of the
coexisting phases.
Finally, the constitutive relations for the associated stress quantities can be readily obtained by fulfilling the free energy
imbalance (16), which implies

Thus, the scalar microstress ùúî, work conjugate to the phase field ùúô, is given by

while the vector microstress ùúª, work conjugate to the phase field gradient, reads
ùúª= ùúïùúìùê∏
ùúï‚àáùúô= ùõº‚àáùúô
(33)
Inserting these constitutive relations (32)‚Äì(33) into the phase field balance (10b) renders the so-called Allen‚ÄìCahn equation:

(34)
Eq. (34) shows that material dissolution is governed by the interface kinetics coefficient ùêø. The magnitude of ùêøcan be considered
to be a constant positive number (see, e.g., Mai et al., 2016). Here, we assume a time-dependent ùêøinstead, enriching the modelling
capabilities by establishing a relation with our FRDR mechanistic interpretation and our definition of a mechanochemically-enhanced
corrosion current density ùëñùëé(ùë°ùëñ). Thus, from Eqs. (2)‚Äì(3) and assuming a linear relationship between ùêøand ùëñùëé, the interface kinetics
coefficient over a time interval ùë°ùëñis defined as
ùêø=
{

)),
if ùë°0 < ùë°ùëñ‚©Ωùë°0 + ùë°ùëì
(35)
We emphasise that the interface kinetics coefficient ùêøincludes the influence of mechanical straining via ùëòm
(ùúÄùëù, ùúé‚Ñé
), and that this is
a one-way coupling in that, while ùúôreduces the material stiffness, there is no ùêø-dependent term in the mechanical problem. Also,
we stress that the mechanical free energy density ùúìùëÄdoes not contribute to the phase field evolution, see (34). In other words,
crack advance takes place due to localised metal loss, as postulated by the slip-dissolution model (see, e.g., Turnbull, 1993). The
framework could be extended to incorporate other cracking mechanisms that include a contribution from ùúìùëÄ; for example, using
a coupled framework such as that by Nguyen et al. (2017b).
The material dissolution process (pitting and cracking) can be either activation-controlled or diffusion-controlled, as it will be
illustrated in our first case study - Section 4.1. The constitutive choices for the mass transport process are obtained as follows. First,
the chemical potential is given by,
ùúá= ‚àí

ùëêsolid
ùúïùúìùê∏
ùúïùëê
= ‚àí2ùê¥
ùëêsolid
((ùëê‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)(ùëêSe ‚àíùëêLe) ‚àíùëêLe
))
(36)
Secondly, the flux ùë±can be determined following a Fick law-type relation as,
ùë±= ùê∑
2ùê¥‚ãÖùëêsolid ‚ãÖùëêsolid ‚ãÖ‚àáùúá= ‚àíùëêsolid ‚ãÖùê∑‚àá((ùëê‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)(ùëêSe ‚àíùëêLe) ‚àíùëêLe
))
(37)
Substituting Eqs. (36)‚Äì(37) into the mass transport balance Eq. (10c), the following field equation is obtained
ùëëùëê
ùëëùë°‚àí‚àá‚ãÖùê∑‚àá((ùëê‚àí‚Ñé(ùúô)(ùëêSe ‚àíùëêLe) ‚àíùëêLe
)) = 0
(38)
which is an extension of Fick‚Äôs second law such that diffusion of metal ions only takes place along the interface and in the electrolyte.
3. Numerical implementation
The finite element method is used to discretise and solve the coupled electro-chemo-mechanical problem. First, we formulate the
weak form of the governing equations for the displacement (19), phase field (34), and concentration (38) problems, respectively.
Thus,

Using Voigt notation, the nodal variables for the displacement field ÃÇùêÆ, the phase field ÃÇùúôand the normalised concentration ÃÇùëêare

ùëñis a diagonal interpolation

Then, the weak form balances (39)‚Äì(41) are discretised in time and space, such that the resulting discrete equations of the

We solve the finite element system by means of a time parametrisation and an incremental-iterative scheme in conjunction
with the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method. Good convergence is achieved without the need for staggered schemes; the residual and
stiffness matrix components are built using current values and all the equations of the system are solved at once. The numerical
model is implemented in the finite element package ABAQUS by means of a user element subroutine (UEL). Abaqus2Matlab
(Papazafeiropoulos et al., 2017) is used for pre-processing the input files. The code, with examples and accompanied documentation,
can be downloaded from www.empaneda.com/codes.
4. Results
We proceed to showcase the potential of the model in predicting localised corrosion with five case studies of particular interest.
First, in Section 4.1, we validate our predictions with analytical solutions in the context of a pure corrosion problem, the classic
benchmark of the pencil electrode test. Secondly, the predictions of the model are compared with experimental measurements of
anodic dissolution-driven defect growth in a C-ring test, see Section 4.2. The influence of mechanical contributions in accelerating
and governing the pit-to-crack transition in stainless steel is addressed in Section 4.3. Then, the interaction between multiple pits
is investigated in Section 4.4 by modelling SCC in a steel plate with pre-existing defects. And finally, the capabilities of the model
in conducting large scale 3D simulations of pit corrosion are showcased in Section 4.5.
4.1. Analytical verification under uniform corrosion: pencil electrode test
The paradigmatic benchmark of a pencil electrode test is addressed first. This boundary value problem enables validating the
numerical framework under pure corrosion conditions, as no mechanical load is applied and no film passivation takes place. The
specimen, a H = 150 Œºm long metal wire with diameter d= 25 Œºm, is mounted into an epoxy coating, leaving only one end of the
sample exposed to the solution ‚Äî see Fig. 3. Thus, the problem is essentially one-dimensional and can be described by the change
in time of the position of the metal‚Äìelectrolyte interface ùë•d.
The evolution of the pit depth ùë•d can be estimated analytically (Scheiner and Hellmich, 2007), and is found to be proportional
to
‚àö
ùë°as,
ùë•d = 2ùúâd
‚àö
ùê∑ùë°
(51)
where the unknown ùúâd is given by:
ùëêsat
ùëêsolid ‚àíùëêsat
exp (‚àíùúâ2
d
) =
‚àö
ùúãùúâd erf (ùúâd
)
(52)
A proportional dependency of the pit depth on
‚àö
ùë°is also observed experimentally (Ernst and Newman, 2002). In both the
experiments and the analytical study, corrosion is assumed to be diffusion-controlled; this can be achieved by using a sufficiently
large applied potential such that reaction rates are high and the surface concentration reaches a saturation magnitude. Using the
phase field method, the pencil electrode test can be conveniently modelled without the need of prescribing a moving ùëêm = ùëêsat
Dirichlet boundary condition at the interface (Mai et al., 2016). Thus, as described in Fig. 3 we assign as initial conditions ùúô= 1
and ùëê= 1 in the metallic wire and prescribe the Dirichlet boundary conditions ùúô= 0 and ùëê= 0 at the pit mouth throughoutJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

the numerical experiment. Neumann boundary conditions ùë±= ùüéand ùëì= 0 are considered at the sides, to simulate the insulation
provided by the epoxy coating. The interface kinetics coefficient is assumed to be constant ùêø= ùêø0, as there is no mechanical
straining or protective film. Following Mai et al. (2016) and Gao et al. (2020), we consider the material and corrosion parameters
shown in Table 1; the values listed for the interface thickness ùëôand the interface energy ùõæresult from the choices of a gradient
energy coefficient ùõº= 4.8 √ó 10‚àí5 N and a height of double well potential ùë§= 33.3 N/mm2, see (30). A uniform finite element mesh
is used, with a characteristic element size 10 times smaller than the interface thickness and employing a total of 15,000 quadratic
quadrilateral plane strain elements.
The contours of the phase field ùúôand the normalised concentration ùëêare given in Fig. 4. Results are shown for two time instants,
38 and 152 s, showing how the metal corrodes and the metal‚Äìelectrolyte evolves. Fig. 4a shows that the normalised concentration
increases from 0 at the pit mouth to ùëêsat‚àïùëêsolid = 0.036 at the metal‚Äìelectrolyte interface; the model captures how a further increase
in the pit surface concentration is prevented as saturation occurs.
The predictions of the model are quantitatively verified against the analytical solution (51)‚Äì(52). As shown in Fig. 5, an excellent
agreement is attained in the calculation of the evolution of the pit depth as a function of
‚àö
ùë°. The results obtained also coincide
with the numerical predictions by Mai et al. (2016) and Gao et al. (2020), further validating our numerical implementation.Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

Fig. 5. Pencil electrode test. Comparison of model predictions for pit depth versus time against analytical results (Scheiner and Hellmich, 2007).
We proceed to showcase the capabilities of the model in capturing both diffusion-controlled and activation-controlled corrosion.
In the pencil electrode test, the corrosion rate is directly controlled by a non-transient parameter ùêø= ùêø0. If ùêø0 is sufficiently high,
as in Figs. 4 and 5 (Table 1), the process is diffusion-controlled, with the electrochemical reaction at the metal‚Äìelectrolyte interface
occurring very fast and leading to saturation in the surface concentration of metal ions. On the other hand, if ùêø0 is small, then
the corrosion process is activation-controlled and the pit depth shows a linear dependence with time. For a given time instant,
e.g. ùë°= 150 s, one can readily see that increasing the interface kinetics coefficient raises the magnitude of the pit depth, but this
sensitivity to ùêø0 is non-linear and saturates as ùêø0 increases; for a sufficiently large value of ùêø0, further increasing its magnitude has
no effect on the corrosion kinetics. Corrosion becomes then diffusion-limited and a higher value of ùê∑should be adopted to increase
dissolution rates.
Model predictions of pit growth versus time as a function of the interface kinetics parameter are shown in Fig. 6a, exhibiting a
linear to parabolic trend with increasing ùêø0. The pit depth evolution is also computed for a large interface kinetics parameter,
ùêø0 = 2 √ó 106 mm2‚àï(N s), and selected values of the diffusion coefficient ùê∑, see Fig. 6b. As expected, the corrosion reaction
exhibits a significant sensitivity to the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient. As the influence of mechanical straining and film
re-passivation and rupture are incorporated, the magnitude of ùêøwill evolve in time and the transition from activation-controlled to
diffusion-controlled corrosion will be captured by the model.
4.2. Chemo-mechanical validation with experiments: C-ring test on Q345R steel
We now verify our model by reproducing the experimental observations by Dai et al. (2020) on C-ring specimens. Q345R steel
samples were exposed to a hydrofluoric acid corrosion environment and the growth of pits and associated cracks was quantified for
different levels of applied mechanical stress. This choice of environment translates into a negligible influence of film passivation,
as the corrosion products are mainly fluorides (not oxides) and the film is not dense enough to prevent the attack of aggressive
ions (Dai et al., 2020). The applied strain is held constant throughout the experiment and thus the sensitivity of defect growth
rates to mechanical stresses can be quantified. This boundary value problem enables us to validate the chemo-mechanical coupling
introduced in our formulation to characterise the interplay between mechanics and corrosion kinetics, see Eq. (3). Note that the
sensitivity of corrosion rates to applied stresses cannot be captured with conventional SCC models that restrict the influence of
mechanical straining to the local film breakage mechanism (see, e.g., Mai and Soghrati, 2017).
The configuration of the experiment is shown in Fig. 7. The sample is subjected to a constant strain by tightening a bolt centred
in the diameter of the ring. The load level is characterised by the circumferential stress at the top of the sample, the region where
localised corrosion will develop. Thus, the magnitude of the circumferential stress ùúéùëêis determined by placing a strain gauge in the
middle of the arc, close to the extreme edge; i.e., in the vicinity of point A, see Fig. 7. The C-ring specimens were exposed to 40 wt%
hydrofluoric acid under room temperature conditions and, using 3D optical microscopy, surface morphologies were characterised
as a function of the stress level and the time (Dai et al., 2020).
In the finite element model we discretise the domain between the two bolt holes. As shown in Fig. 7, the sample has an inner
diameter of 20 mm and an outer diameter of 25 mm. The vertical and horizontal displacements are constrained at the left side,
while a Dirichlet boundary condition is used to prescribe the horizontal displacement component of the right side, where the bolt
is tightened. The load is prescribed at the beginning of the analysis and then held fixed throughout the calculation. The resulting
circumferential stress is measured at the top of the sample (point A), to resemble the experimental measurements. In agreementJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

In regard to the corrosion parameters, those listed in Table 1 are used unless otherwise stated. Since no film passivation is
involved, we define ùëò= 0 in Eq. (35). The initial interface kinetics coefficient ùêø0 is chosen so as to provide the best fit to the
experimental data; here, ùêø0 = 4.7 √ó 10‚àí5 mm2‚àï(N s). The interface thickness is taken to be ùëô= 0.05 mm and the finite element
mesh is refined in the SCC region accordingly, with the characteristic element size being equal or smaller than 0.005 mm. A total
of 10,681 quadrilateral quadratic elements are used. As shown in Fig. 8, several pits are observed in the experiments, with one
of them becoming a particularly large crack ‚Äî we aim at capturing this dominant localised corrosion defect and address later the
occurrence of multiple pits and their interactions. To trigger the dominant localised defect, the Dirichlet boundary condition ùúô= 0
is prescribed over a length of 0.05 mm in the extreme edge of the middle of the arc (point A). The finite element results obtained in
terms of SCC defect length and shape are provided in Fig. 8; the experimental measurements from Dai et al. (2020) corresponding
to the same time (ùë°= 210 min) and stress level (ùúéùëê= 0.8ùúéùë¶) are also shown.
Fig. 8 reveals a good agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative comparison with experiments for different stress
levels is provided in Fig. 9. Results are shown in terms of the length of the SCC region, including the initial pitting and subsequentJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

cracking, as a function of time. A very good agreement is observed for both ùúéùëê= 0.55ùúéùë¶and ùúéùëê= 0.8ùúéùë¶. We emphasise that while
the circumferential stress in the middle of the arc remains below the yield stress, plasticity can develop on the surface of the SCC
defects as the resulting notches and cracks act as stress concentrators.
4.3. Parametric study: cracking from a semi-elliptical pit
We proceed to conduct numerical experiments on a stainless steel plate, containing a pre-existing pit, to investigate the effect
of both mechanical straining and repassivation on the SCC process. The geometric setup, dimensions and boundary conditions are
given in Fig. 10. The Dirichlet boundary conditions ùúô= 0 and ùëê= 0 are prescribed at the surface of the pre-existing defect, which
has a semi-elliptical shape with radii 0.01 and 0.02 mm. At ùë°= 0, ùëê= 1 and ùúô= 1 are defined as initial conditions in the metallic
plate, of height 0.15 mm and width of 0.3 mm. The mechanical load is applied by prescribing a remote horizontal displacement ùë¢‚àû
on the left and right edges of the sample, as shown in Fig. 10. The vertical displacement of the top right corner is constrained to
prevent rigid body motion.
The corrosion parameters in this study are those assumed in the pencil electrode test, see Table 1, with the exception of the
interface kinetics coefficient; a magnitude of ùêø0 = 0.001 mm2‚àï(N s) is adopted to ensure activation-controlled corrosion. The
constitutive behaviour of the steel plate is characterised by a Young modulus of ùê∏= 190 GPa, a Poisson‚Äôs ratio of ùúà= 0.3, an
initial yield stress of ùúéùë¶= 520 MPa and a strain hardening exponent of ùëÅ= 0.067. Approximately 7,000 quadrilateral quadratic
plane strain elements are used to discretise the model.
First, we consider the case of mechanics-enhanced corrosion in the absence of a passivation mechanism. The goal is to characterise
the role of mechanical straining in controlling the defect growth rate and shape. Thus, we make ùëò= 0 in Eq. (35) and prescribe
three different values of the remote displacement ùë¢‚àû= 0.02 Œºm, ùë¢‚àû= 0.1 Œºm and ùë¢‚àû= 0.125 Œºm. The remote displacement ùë¢‚àûis
prescribed at the beginning of the numerical experiment and then held fixed over a total time of 900 s. The results obtained, in
terms of the phase field and hydrostatic stress contours, are shown in Fig. 11.
The results reveal that, when the mechanical load is small (ùë¢‚àû= 0.02 Œºm), there is a negligible influence of the hydrostatic stress
and the pit grows approximately the same length in all dimensions, in agreement with the corrosion evolution laws in the absence
of mechanical contributions. However as the remote displacement is raised and the magnitude of ùúé‚Ñéincreases, the pit morphology
changes and a pit-to-crack transition is observed. The dominance of the mechanics contributions becomes very clear in the case of
ùë¢‚àû= 0.125 Œºm, where the stresses are sufficiently high to trigger plastic deformations and the shape of the SCC defect is governed
by both the hydrostatic stress and the plastic strain distribution. It is also worth emphasising that mechanical straining not only
sharpens the SCC defect but also increases its length. The length of the SCC region is shown in Fig. 12 for the three chosen values
of the applied displacement ùë¢‚àû. It can be seen that the mechanical contribution has a significant effect on localised corrosion rates.
We now turn our attention to the repassivation process and our film rupture‚Äìdissolution‚Äìrepassivation (FRDR) formulation. Thus,
we apply and hold fixed a remote displacement of ùë¢‚àû= 0.1 Œºm and consider the sensitivity of the results to changes in the material
parameter characterising the corrosion sensitivity to the stability of the passive film, ùëò- see Eqs. (2) and (35). Three representative
values are considered: ùëò= 2 √ó 10‚àí4, ùëò= 5 √ó 10‚àí4, and ùëò= 1 √ó 10‚àí3; while the critical strain for film rupture and the time interval
without repassivation are held constant at ùúÄùëì= 3 √ó 10‚àí3 and ùë°0 = 10 s, respectively.
The phase field contours obtained after 900 s are shown in Fig. 13. The impact of ùëòin the SCC morphology is evident; higher
ùëòvalues accelerate the SCC defect growth rate in the pit base relative to corrosion rates at the pit mouth, sharpening the pit and
triggering a pit-to-crack transition. Corrosion rates at the tip of the SCC defect are exacerbated as the defect sharpens and plasticity
localises; the protective film is weaker in areas of high mechanical straining ‚Äî see Eq. (1). The length of the SCC region is shown
in Fig. 14 as a function of the film stability parameter ùëò, including the case where no film is present (ùëò= 0). The results reveal
that by introducing the repassivation process, the length of the SCC region drops slightly at an early stage, which is in accordanceJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

with the fact that repassivation will restrain the SCC process by decreasing the value of interface kinetics coefficient. After a certain
time, the size of the SCC region grows faster with increasing ùëòas film rupture occurs and the magnitude of the equivalent plastic
strain increases as the defect sharpens, augmenting the interface kinetics coefficient ‚Äî see Eq. (35).
Finally, we gain insight into the model predictions at the local level by quantifying the evolution the interface kinetics coefficient
as a function of time and space. We compare the interface kinetics coefficient ùêøat the SCC tip to further clarify the local behaviours.Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

passivation, in agreement with expectations. In all cases, the magnitude of ùêø‚àïùêø0 increases with time but eventually reaches a
plateau. This indicates that mechanical straining dominates the corrosion process. Also, it is observed that SCC damage becomes
more localised as the stability of the film ùëòincreases. This is showcased in Fig. 15b, where the spatial contour of ùêø‚àïùêø0 is shown
in the interface region. Higher values of the interface kinetics coefficient are observed at the tip of the pit, where the mechanical
fields (ùúÄùëù, ùúé‚Ñé) are larger.
4.4. SCC driven by the interaction between multiple pits
Component failure frequently takes place as a consequence of the interaction between multiple pits. In this section, we
demonstrate the capabilities of the model in predicting failure due to the combined action of multiple pits and their coalescence, as
well as investigating the role of corrosion parameters in driving the evolution of neighbouring pits. For this purpose, we model a
steel plate with an inner defect (not exposed to the environment) and three pre-existing corrosion pits. As shown in Fig. 16, one of
the existing pits has a semi-ellipsoidal shape with radii 0.1 and 0.2 mm, while the other two pits have a semi-circular profile and
the same radius: 0.15 mm. The mechanical load is applied by prescribing a remote horizontal displacement equal to ùë¢‚àû= 0.01 on
each side of the plate. The displacement is prescribed at the beginning of the analysis and held constant afterwards (step function).
The corrosion and material parameters considered are those listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. However, note that a smaller
value is assumed for the interface kinetics coefficient, ùêø0 = 1 √ó 10‚àí4 mm2‚àï(N s), so as to simulate activation-controlled corrosion.
Also, the interface thickness is chosen to be equal to ùëô= 0.2 mm, which is 20 times larger than the characteristic element size. The
plate is discretised using 27,450 quadrilateral quadratic plane strain elements with reduced integration. In addition, the presence
of a protective film and its rupture is captured by considering a film stability parameter ùëò= 2 √ó 10‚àí4.
The SCC process is shown as a function of time in Fig. 17, where the blue and red colours correspond to the completely
corroded and intact areas, respectively. We can see that the three pits increase in depth (Fig. 17a), with the upper two eventually
branching (Fig. 17b). The bottom pit eventually coalesces with the central circular defect (Fig. 17c), while the branches of the upper
defects sharpen ‚Äî one growing towards the central defect and the other one in the direction of the bottom pit. Eventually, after
approximately 4 h, the upper and bottom pits merge and complete failure of the plate is predicted (Fig. 17d).
We also compare the SCC morphologies for three different values of ùêø0 to assess the influence of the interface kinetics parameter
on the corrosion process. The results are shown in Fig. 18 for a time of ùë°= 0.5 h. It can be seen that the pits grow more uniformly
when the initial interface kinetics parameter is higher, implying a smaller contribution of the mechanical problem with increasing ùêø0.
Mechanical strains and stresses enhance interface kinetics via the mechanochemical term ùëòm
(ùúÄùëù, ùúé‚Ñé
), see (3) and (35). However, this
also implies that the mechanical contribution facilitates the transition from activation-controlled corrosion to diffusion-controlled
corrosion, and when ùêøis sufficiently large such that corrosion is diffusion-limited, corrosion rates become independent of ùêø(see
Fig. 6a) and accordingly of ùëòm. Consequently, for a given value of the remote load, the contribution from the mechanical problem
will be larger for lower ùêø0 magnitudes.
4.5. Three-dimensional predictions of SCC defect growth
Finally, we extend our computational framework to model 3D SCC problems. The goal is to bring new insight into the mechanics
of SCC defect growth and demonstrate the capabilities of our model in addressing technologically-relevant case studies. For this
purpose, we choose to model a hemispherical pit in a sufficiently large steel plate subjected to tension, aiming to rationalise the
observation of cracks initiating at the cross-section of uniaxial tension samples (Turnbull et al., 2010). The pit, of radius 0.15 mm,
has its centre located at 3 mm from the loading edge and at 1 mm along the plate thickness. The geometry, initial and boundary
conditions are given in Fig. 19. The remote displacement, applied along the ùë•axis, is prescribed at the beginning of the numerical
experiment and is held constant throughout the analysis; its magnitude equals ùë¢‚àû= 0.01 mm. The corrosion and material parameters
adopted are those listed in Tables 1 and 2 with the exception of an initial kinetics coefficient of ùêø0 = 3 √ó 10‚àí4 mm2‚àï(N s), to ensureJournal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

that at ùë°= 0+ corrosion is activation-controlled. Also, the presence of a protective film is considered, with ùëò= 2√ó10‚àí4. The interface
thickness is chosen to be ùëô= 0.4 mm, which is 20 times larger than the characteristic element size. A total of 356,892 10-node
tetrahedral elements are used; the model contains approximately 2.5 million degrees-of-freedom (DOFs).
The predicted evolution of the SCC defect is shown in Figs. 20 and 21, in terms of 3D phase field contours. For the sake of a better
visualisation, a cut along the ùë¶-ùëßplane is made in Fig. 20 while Fig. 21 shows the SCC region where ùúô< 0.5. It can be observed
that the pit tends to grow more along the ùë¶and ùëßdirections, relative to the ùë•one. This shape evolution of the pit, going from
hemispherical to ellipsoidal, is driven by the influence of the mechanical problem. Plastic straining is larger at the pit base and the
regions of the pit mouth closer to the cross-section perpendicular to the applied load. Consequently, the magnitude of ùëòm
(ùúÄùëù, ùúé‚Ñé

larger in these regions and the passive film weaker, leading to an increase in the interface kinetics coefficient. This is in agreement
with experimental observations of increasing pit depth and the initiation of lateral cracks (Turnbull, 2001).Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 147 (2021) 104254

higher will continue to corrode faster until ùêøreaches its saturation value everywhere, when uniform corrosion will be recovered.
5. Concluding remarks
We have presented a new formulation for predicting dissolution-driven pitting and stress corrosion cracking. Its main ingredients
are: (i) a KKS-based phase field model for both activation-controlled and diffusion-controlled corrosion, (ii) a mechanics-enhanced
interface kinetics law grounded on mechanochemical theory, and (iii) a strain rate-governed film rupture and repassivation process
according to the FRDR mechanism. A numerical framework is also presented, with displacements, phase field and concentration of
dissolved ions as degrees of freedom. The model is benchmarked by addressing five boundary value problems of particular interest.
First, we model the paradigmatic pencil electrode test to verify our numerical implementation and examine the model capabilities
in predicting the transition from activation-controlled to diffusion-controlled corrosion. Secondly, we reproduce C-ring experiments
in a film-free environment to benchmark our mechanics-enhanced corrosion laws against experimental data. Thirdly, SCC from
an ellipsoidal pit is predicted under different conditions to quantify the influence of mechanical stresses and their interplay with
the film rupture and repassivation process. Fourthly, the interaction between multiple pits is addressed, assessing the competing
influences of the coefficients characterising the mechanical, film stability and interface kinetics contributions. Finally, pit growth
in a 3D solid is predicted to showcase the capabilities of the model in capturing large scale phenomena and impacting engineering
practice. The main findings are:
‚àôThe interface kinetics coefficient ùêøgoverns corrosion rates. Corrosion kinetics rise with increasing ùêø, going from activation-
controlled to diffusion-controlled corrosion, until the process becomes diffusion-limited, when corrosion rates become insen-
sitive to a further augmenting ùêø.
‚àôMechanical stresses and strains enhance corrosion kinetics, in agreement with experiments, favouring localised damage and
triggering a pit-to-crack transition. However, if the mechanical enhancement of ùêøis sufficiently large, the diffusion-controlled
limit is reached and the influence of the mechanical contribution reaches a saturation stage. Thus, the influence of mechanical
fields is most notable for activation-controlled corrosion.
‚àôThe presence of a passive film exacerbates localisation and the role of mechanics. The effect is more pronounced if the film
stability coefficient is large as film rupture will only occur in regions where mechanical straining is high. Also, cracks are more
likely to nucleate under activation-controlled corrosion conditions.
Future developments could involve the extension of the model to consider other cracking mechanisms, including those driven
by cathodic reactions. Also, material microstructure and microchemistry can play an important role and should be taken into
consideration in many material systems for an accurate prediction of the initial development stages.
