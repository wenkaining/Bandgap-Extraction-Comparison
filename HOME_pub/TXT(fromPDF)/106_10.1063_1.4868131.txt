We perform correlated studies of individual GaN nanowires in scanning electron microscopy
combined to low temperature cathodoluminescence, microphotoluminescence, and scanning
transmission electron microscopy. We show that some nanowires exhibit well localized regions
emitting light at the energy of a stacking fault bound exciton (3.42 eV) and are able to observe the
presence
of
a
single
stacking
fault
in
these
regions.

Carrier diffusion length is a key quantity in optoelec-
tronics, as it notably plays a signiﬁcant role in the competi-
tion between radiative and non-radiative processes, especially
in materials with large densities of defects. Concerning
nitride semiconductors, various studies have established that
carrier diffusion length in InGaN and GaN bidimensional
(2D) layers is rather small, in the range of 50–250 nm.1–7
Such lengths are smaller than the typical distance between
dislocations,8 one among other possible reasons for the sur-
prising efﬁciency of radiative recombination in InGaN quan-
tum wells in spite of the high density of defects in current
heterostructures. With the aim of further efﬁciency improve-
ment, a current trend in nitride optoelectronics research is to
explore the potential of nanowires (NWs) as building-blocks
for light emission or absorption devices. This approach has
already led to the realization of NW heterostructure-based
light-emitting diodes (LEDs).9–12 In the case of these pioneer-
ing works, the small diameter of NWs raises the issue of the
inﬂuence of size effects on carrier diffusion. More generally,
the issue of carrier diffusion length in GaN NWs is poorly
documented to date. Recent works13–15 suggest that recombi-
nations are faster in InGaN nanorods than in 2D layers, which
are correlated to a smaller carrier diffusion length and have
been tentatively assigned to possible surface damage. In this
Letter, we address the issue of exciton diffusion length in sin-
gle GaN NWs with a diameter in the range of 100nm. For
this purpose, low-temperature cathodoluminescence (CL)
experiments have been performed on individual NWs in cor-
relation with microphotoluminescence (lPL) and scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies that reveal
the presence of I1 basal stacking faults (SFs). It is well known
from 2D-layer studies that such SFs are radiative recombina-
tion centers.16–18 Previous TEM/CL studies on GaN epilayers
have already evidenced the correlation between the presence
of different types of SFs with well identiﬁed emission
peaks.16,17 The density of structural defects was relatively
large in those samples. In the case of our NWs, we show that
emission peaks are linked to the presence of a single defect,
acting as a quasi-punctual recombination center. By varying
the distance between the SF and the CL excitation spot, we
investigate the diffusion length along the NW axis.

substrate.
Desoxydation of the silicon is done in situ by annealing at
950 C until the clear appearance of the 7  7 surface recon-
struction at 820 C. The growth temperature, set at 820 C, is
determined by the measurement of the corresponding Ga de-
sorption time.19,20 A thin AlN buffer layer (2–3 nm thick) is
grown directly onto the silicon. Used as a seed layer for the
GaN nanowires, it decreases the tilt of the NWs relative to the
normal to the surface.21 This helps to obtain well separated
nanowires, even for extensive growth time. NWs were grown
for 18h in N-rich conditions (Ga/N ratio of 0.3).22 They are L
¼ 3 lm long and their diameters range from 50 to 100nm.
As grown NWs are mechanically dispersed onto 2 kinds
of substrates. Substrate S1 is used for CL and lPL studies. It
is made of a Si wafer. Localization marks are patterned by
standard deep UV (DUV) optical lithography followed by re-
active ion etching (RIE), using the resist as a mask. It is then
sputtered with a 100 nm-thick Al layer and a 20 nm-thick
SiO2 layer. For combined TEM and CL studies, substrate S2
consists of a home-made 35 nm thick Si3N4 membrane with
a window size of 90 lm. Arrays of nitride membranes are
fabricated starting from a 200 lm thick Si (100) wafer with a
layer of low stress Si3N4 of 35 nm on top of a 240 nm thick
SiO2 layer on each side. The fabrication procedure is
described in Ref. 23, with the difference that for these mem-
branes the SiO2 layer is removed below the Si3N4 layer by
RIE and a sequential KOH etch. Optical DUV lithography
and electron beam metallization are used to pattern Ti-Au
markers on the membranes to locate the same NW in differ-
ent experiments.
CL images are taken at 5 K in a FEI scanning electron
microscope (SEM) and analyzed through a 45 cm spectrome-
ter and UV-optimized grating with 600 grooves/mm. Figures
1(a) and 1(b) present simultaneously recorded SEM and CL
images of 3 NWs on substrate S1. The color scale of the CL
image is set in order to show that light comes from the whole

206.196.184.84 On: Tue, 16 Dec 2014 21:16:26length of the NWs. Nevertheless, a strong emission arises
from 3 bright spots, which saturate the image. Figure 1(c)
presents three spectra with a ﬁxed electron beam excitation at
three locations (#1 to #3) shown on image Fig. 1(b). The spec-
trum #3 is representative of the emission from the whole
length and is similar to the ensemble PL measurements on the
as-grown sample. One observes a peak at 3.48 eV that corre-
sponds to the emission from neutral donor bound exciton
(D0X) and a peak at 3.28 eV with its phonon replica at lower
energy that is attributed to donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs).
Spectra #2 and #3 show that the bright spots are associated to
an extra emission peak at 3.42 eV attributed to the emission
from stacking fault bound excitons (SFX).16,24,25 CL observa-
tions allow us to locate well isolated NWs with SFX emission
that are further studied by microphotoluminescence. lPL
spectra are similar to Fig. 1(c) with a magnitude of the
3.42 eV peak slightly smaller or comparable to the D0X one.
This is well understood by considering that the laser excita-
tion spot is larger than the NW and that the lPL spectrum
integrates light emitted over its whole volume. The linewidth
of the D0X peak varies signiﬁcantly from one NW to the other
between 2 and 20 meV, whereas the 3.42 eV peak linewidth is
always in the 10–20 meV range. The larger linewidth of the
3.42 eV peak has been reported before26 and is still of
unknown origin.
Further evidence of the correlation between the emission
at 3.42 eV and the presence of a SF is given by joint CL and
STEM studies of the same NW on a S2 substrate. A well iso-
lated NW is ﬁrst identiﬁed in low-temperature CL (Figs.
2(b)–2(d)). It displays a localized emission at 3.42 eV near
one of its tips. The D0X signal is more homogeneous, except
for two areas where it is quenched. One of them corresponds
to the place where the 3.42 eV emission occurs, and the other
one is in the middle of the NW. In Figure 2(a)), a bright ﬁeld
scanning TEM (BF STEM) image of the same NW is shown
oriented along the [2-1-10] direction. We note that between
the two observations, the NW remained at the same location
but rotated onto itself. It explains why the small piece of
GaN attached to the NW is at different positions between
Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The region marked by the red rectangle
in Fig. 2(a) is shown at higher magniﬁcation in BF STEM
(Fig. 2(f)) and high angular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) STEM
images (Fig. 2(e)), which reveal the presence of a stacking
fault. For sake of clarity, it is indicated by an arrow in both
images, as well as a line following the stacking of the Ga
columns in the 2H hexagonal wurtzite structure (ABABA.
stacking), which is disrupted by the insertion of one C plane
(.ABABCAC. stacking) characteristic of a cubic zinc blende
phase. Comparison of the CL and STEM data clearly shows
that the 3.42 eV emission exhibits an excellent spatial corre-
lation with the location of the SF. On the other hand, Fig.
2(g) shows a higher magniﬁcation BF STEM image of the
region indicated with the blue rectangle in Fig. 2(a), which is
correlated with a quenching of D0X CL emission. In this
region, we observe no feature indicating the presence of
crystal defects. A continuous smooth contrast over this
region was conﬁrmed by high resolution STEM, as for the
rest of the NW (not shown here).
The proﬁle of the CL signal along the NW longitudinal
axis at 3.42 eV is therefore related to the probability for an
exciton to be trapped by a single SF acting as a radiative
recombination center. We deﬁne nFX (x, t) (resp. nD0X and
nSFX) as the linear density of free excitons (FX) (resp. neutral
donor and SF bound excitons) between x and x þ dx.
Extending the model of Corfdir et al.,18 and using the same
assumptions (absence of non-radiative decay channels and
detrapping processes of bound excitons), one writes

radiatively, with time sr,FX, or through surface effect, s being
the surface recombination velocity and d the NW diameter.27
The last line of Eq. (1) corresponds to the trapping of free
excitons by neutral donors (characteristic time sFX!D0X),
DAPs (sFX!DAP) or the SF. In the latter case, cFX!SFXðxÞ has
a nonzero value 1=s0

L=2 nSFX=sr;SFXdx
(resp. Ð nD0X=sr;D0X). lPL observations show that their sta-
tionary values have the same amplitude. Hence, the SF cap-
ture rate is dramatically larger than the one of the neutral
donors, in agreement with the results of Ref. 18. From Eqs.

tion xp by the electron beam, pðxÞ ¼ p0dðx  xpÞ. Outside

Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments in en-

and 29) and s ¼ 2.7 104 cm/s.13,14 In the set of NWs, we have
studied d ¼ 110 6 10 nm. Hence, the two ﬁrst terms of Eq.
(4) contribute with the same magnitude to the effective
decay rate of the FX. The capture rate by neutral donors or
DAPs depends on their density. For pure undoped thick
layers of GaN, CL experiments report exciton diffusion
lengths in the vicinity of threading dislocations ranging from
L2D ¼ 81 (Ref. 30) to 201 nm.31 In our NW sample, the ab-
sence of a peak at the FX energy and the presence of D0X
and DAP peaks in the spectra let us infer that the capture rate
1=sFX!D0X þ 1=sFX!DAP is larger than the radiative or sur-
face decay terms.
Close to a SF, the effective decay rate 1/seff is dominated
by the SF capture rate 1=s0
FX!SFX, which is L/wSF larger than
the D0X capture rate. The corresponding diffusion length is
therefore divided by a factor
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L=wSF
p
. It is in the 10 nm
range, of the same order of magnitude as wSF. This means
that a large fraction of incoming excitons is trapped by the SF
and later converted into a photon. The SF ﬂuorescence signal
is therefore proportional to nFXðx ¼ 0Þ ¼ n0 expðjxpj=LNWÞ.
Figures 3(b) and 3(d) plot the CL signal in logscale as a
function of the longitudinal wire coordinate x for two differ-
ent NWs on a S1 substrate. The peaks are well ﬁtted by con-
voluting an exponential decay with a Gaussian function of
width wp ¼ 30 6 10 nm for electron acceleration voltages
V  10 kV. This is larger than wSF and rather reﬂects the size
of the excitation region by the electron beam. For V ¼ 5 kV,
wp is degraded to 70 nm. We attribute this effect to backscat-
tered electrons in the NW at lower energy. At distances
larger than wp from the peak center, the tails on each side are
well ﬁtted by exponential functions with characteristic length
LNW (dashed lines). Average of LNW measured for an ensem-
ble of 12 NWs gives LNW ¼ 68 6 16 nm < L2D. Based on the
previous discussion, it conﬁrms that the capture by neutral
donors or DAP dominates the FX effective decay rate. We
also observe a large dispersion on the values of LNW, with
sometimes abrupt changes like around x ¼ 800 nm on Fig.
3(d). This is evidence of long range variations of 1/seff. The
latter can arise from changes of the density of neutral donors
or DAPs or the presence of an extra nonradiative decay term
nFX=snr;FXðxÞ in Eq. (1) due to other kind of impurities.
Further evidence of long range variations of the NW pa-
rameters is given by the CL signal at the D0X emission
energy (Figures 3(a) and 3(c)). Its amplitude variations can
only be accounted for if one assumes that sFX!D0X varies
along the wire length or if one adds an extra nonradiative
decay term nD0X=snr;D0XðxÞ to Eq. (2) due to the trapping of
the D0X by other defects. For example, a SF can capture
excitons from the neighboring neutral donors18 resulting in a
localized quenching area [arrows on Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)].
However, we also observe extended NW areas where a

if the previously introduced capture or decay rates experi-
ence long range variations and are not just point-like as for
the SF defects. We observe no clear correlation between the
D0X signal magnitude and LNW. This means that 1/seff is
determined by other parameters like DAP capture rate or
nonradiative decay.
In conclusion, we are able to observe single SFs present
in individual NWs with different optical and structural tech-
niques. The CL proﬁle in the vicinity of a SF is well under-
stood by a simple diffusion model of the exciton.
