The photovoltaic reciprocity theory relates the electroluminescence spectrum of a solar cell under applied
bias to the external photovoltaic quantum efficiency of the device as measured at short circuit conditions. Its
derivation is based on detailed balance relations between local absorption and emission rates in optically
isotropic media with nondegenerate quasiequilibrium carrier distributions. In many cases, the dependence of
density and spatial variation of electronic and optical device states on the point of operation is modest and the
reciprocity relation holds. In nanostructure-based photovoltaic devices exploiting confined modes, however,
the underlying assumptions are no longer justifiable. In the case of ultrathin absorber solar cells, the
modification of the electronic structure with applied bias is significant due to the large variation of the built-in
field. Straightforward use of the external quantum efficiency as measured at short circuit conditions in the
photovoltaic reciprocity theory thus fails to reproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias
voltage. This failure is demonstrated here by numerical simulation of both spectral quantities at normal
incidence and emission for an ultrathin GaAs p-i-n solar cell using an advanced quantum kinetic formalism
based on nonequilibrium Green’s functions of coupled photons and charge carriers. While coinciding with the
semiclassical relations under the conditions of their validity, the theory provides a consistent microscopic
relationship between absorption, emission, and charge carrier transport in photovoltaic devices at arbitrary
operating conditions and for any shape of optical and electronic density of states.

Absorption and emission of light by a semiconductor
material are two physical processes that are related by the
fundamental laws of light-matter coupling. For a given set
of electronic states connected by an optical transition, the
two processes are described in terms of identical optical
matrix elements and joint density of electronic states
participating in the transition. In thermal equilibrium, the
principle of detailed balance dictates a vanishing net
transition rate. On these grounds, the absorption coefficient
has been related to the radiative lifetime of charge carriers
under nonequilibrium conditions [1], and to the local
emission spectrum at finite splitting of quasi-Fermi levels
[2]. In the first case, the absorption coefficient α determines
the prefactor B of the local rate of radiative recombination

this result was derived under the assumption of unrestricted
optical transitions (no momentum selection rule), of qua-

distinct and constant (bulk) quasi-Fermi levels for electrons
and holes, and of an optically homogeneous medium
exhibiting a photon density of states for free field modes,

Boltzmann statistics are used for the carrier densities in
Ref. [1] and substituted for the Bose factor in Eq. (2), which
is often found in literature, though strictly valid only at high
temperature and far from degeneracy. Expression (2)
constitutes one of the main ingredients of the photovoltaic
reciprocity theory as formulated in Ref. [3], which relates
the luminescent emission of a solar cell under applied bias
voltage to the external quantum efficiency QPV of the same
device under illumination, and which has found widespread
application in luminescence-based characterization of pho-
tovoltaic materials, cells, and modules [4–7]. For the case
of an applied electrical bias V and a QPV that is determined
at normal incidence and short circuit conditions (V ¼ 0),

© 2017 American Physical SocietyThe limits for the applicability of the photovoltaic
reciprocity relation as encoded in Eq.. (3) have been
investigated for different situations where some of the
basic assumptions—such as the superposition principle or
the Donolato theorem [8]—do not hold [9–12]. For
instance, in Ref. [11], numerical device simulations were
used to show the failure of the reciprocity relation in the
case of nonidentical band diagrams in the dark and under
illumination. However, these numerical experiments are
limited by the validity of the underlying description of the
photovoltaic device operation, which has thus far been
restricted to semiclassical bulk physics. On the other hand,
there is a range of photovoltaic device architectures under
active development where this conventional bulk picture is
no longer appropriate as it fails to reflect the dependence of
the microscopic electronic structure on the operating point
of the device, such as nanostructure-based and ultrathin
solar cells [13,14]. In this Letter, we therefore assess the
validity of Eqs. (2) and (3) if applied to ultrathin solar cells
by comparison with the quantum-kinetic picture of radia-
tive charge carrier generation, transport, and recombination
as formulated within the nonequilibrium Green’s function
(NEGF) formalism [15–17]. To this end, the coupled
NEGF problems of interacting electrons and photons are
solved—for the first time—for a realistic solar cell device
exhibiting a complex potential profile, such as the ultrathin
GaAs p-i-n structure displayed in Fig. 1.
In the case of a planar absorber, the local NEGF
expressions for the spectral radiative rates (per unit volume,

In the above equations, q∥is the transverse—i.e., in-plane
—component of the photon wave vector, D denotes the
transverse photon Green’s function, and Π is the transverse
photon self-energy tensor related to the polarization of the
electronic system [20]. These expressions provide a general
microscopic relation between local absorption and emis-
sion rates in terms of occupied photon and electron-hole
pair states (D<, Π<) and the corresponding final state
spectral functions ( ˆΠ ≡Π> −Π<,
ˆD ≡D> −D<). The
expressions are valid for the arbitrary shape of the density
of states and nonequilibrium occupation corresponding to
the actual operating point of the structure under optical or
electronic excitation.
For the comparison with the semiclassical quasiequili-
brium result (2), several approximations corresponding to
the restricted regime of validity of the latter are applied to
Eqs. (5) and (6). In the case of the absorption, coupling to a
coherent radiation field permits us to replace the photon
Green’s function by the electromagnetic vector potential A

Equation (8) formally defines the local and modal absorption

ˆΠðEγÞfBEðEγ −ΔμÞ, which, inserted in Eq. (11), repro-
duces expression (2). At this point, however, it needs to be
emphasized that the two polarization function components
entering expressions (10) and (11) are computed on the
basis of the same electronic Green’s functions, which in
turn may depend strongly on the point of operation. As
shown in Fig. 2 displaying the absorption coefficient and
spectral emission rate in the center of the intrinsic region of
a 100 nm GaAs p-i-n photodiode, this is indeed the case for
ultrathin absorber solar cells: due to the strong impact of the
built-in field on the local absorption coefficient [13], the
emission spectrum at V ¼ 1 V based on the generalized
Planck law (2)— ¯RGP
em—does only coincide with the one
obtained from the isotropic NEGF expression (11)—
¯RNEGF
em
—if the absorption coefficient at V ¼ 1 V is used.
In contrast, the generalized Planck emission spectrum
based on the absorption coefficient at short circuit con-
ditions (V ¼ 0 V) shows a strong field-induced redshift
and broadening as compared to the NEGF spectrum.
Since the validity of the generalized Planck law is an
essential requisite for the photovoltaic reciprocity relation
to hold, the above finding has severe consequences for the
applicability of Eq. (3) to the case of the ultrathin solar cells
under consideration, as QPV is conventionally defined at
zero applied bias voltage where it provides the short circuit
current Jsc under the action of the external illumination
spectrum. However, for a proper assessment of Eq. (3), the
local relation (2) between absorption and emission first
needs to be propagated to the global relation between QPV
and the emitted photon flux ϕem at the surface of the device.
To this end, in addition to the local dynamics, knowledge of
the propagation of light inside the cell is required. This
information is encoded in the NEGF version of the
Poynting vector component SzðzÞ ¼ R dEγSzðz; EγÞ for
the energy flux normal to the slab surface, which in terms

the global emission spectra provided by the full NEGF
solution are compared to those obtained from the general-
izedKirchhoff law using theabsorptancedeterminedat short
circuit conditions (V ¼ 0 V), which corresponds to the
standard definition of the external quantum efficiency

absorbers subject to large variation of built-in fields with

optically more complex situation of a device with a gold
back reflector attached to the right side, as shown in Fig. 4.
At this point, it is interesting to note that while the global
emission rate resulting from spatial integration of the local
rate (4) gives the radiative dark current upon integration over

In conclusion, we presented a critical assessment of the
photovoltaic reciprocity relation between external quantum
efficiency and electroluminescent emission in ultrathin
solar cells, by application of a comprehensive nonequili-
brium quantum theory of photovoltaic device operation
which considers both electronic and optical degrees of
freedom on equal footing. The explicit relation of the
macroscopic device properties to the microscopic non-
equilibrium charge carrier states reveals the approximate
nature of the semiclassical reciprocity theorem and pro-
vides at the same time a more generally valid picture of
local
(generalized
Planck)
and
global
(generalized
Kirchhoff) connections between radiative processes in
mesoscopic solar cell devices. This is of high practical
relevance for photovoltaic devices whose characteristics are
no longer determined by the equilibrium bulk properties of
the constituent materials, but by the actual nonequilibrium
device state at the operating point, as in the case of the
ultrathin solar cell architectures considered here and in a
wide range of nanostructure-based implementations of
third-generation solar cell concepts.

FIG. 4.
Same as Fig. 3, but now for a system with a gold back
reflector attached at the right side. Additionally, the global
emission rate R⊥;glob
em
obtained from the z integration of the local
rate for normal emission is shown (dash-dotted line), revealing
the effect of reabsorption on the spectral shape and intensity of
the emission at the surface.
