We report the emergence of bulk superconductivity in Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0 below 0.68 and
0.36 K, respectively. This is the ﬁrst observation of superconductivity in Tsai-type crystalline approximants of
quasicrystals. The Tsai-type cluster center is occupied by Au and Ge ions in the former approximant, and by an Yb ion in
the latter. For magnetism, the latter system shows a larger magnetization than the former. To explain this observation,
we propose a model that the cluster-center Yb ion is magnetic. The relationship between the magnetism and the
superconductivity is also discussed.
Quasicrystals (QCs) have been classiﬁed as the third solid
because they possess long-range, quasi-periodic structures
with diffraction symmetries forbidden for crystals. Owing
to the considerable progress since the discovery of QCs in
resolving their geometric structure,1–3) QCs are nowadays
considered as a type of crystal. For their electronic structure,
on the other hand, no long-range magnetic ordering has been
observed although there are a few reports on superconduc-
tivity.4,5) For a periodic approximant crystal (AC), a phase
whose composition is close to that of the QC and whose unit
cell has atomic decorations similar to those of the QC, there
are some reports on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic
orderings. However, superconductivity has not been discov-
ered thus far to the best of our knowledge.
Recently, new types of magnetic QC and AC has been
discovered:
the
Au–Al–Yb
(AAY)
QC
exhibits
novel
quantum critical behavior as observed in Yb-based heavy-
fermion materials with intermediate Yb valence,6) while the
AAY AC shows heavy-Fermi-liquid behavior. Since the
diverging behavior of magnetic susceptibility as T ! 0 was
only observed in the QC, the quantum critical state may
correspond to an electronic state unique to the QCs, i.e., a
critical state that is neither extended nor localized.
In the course of our research on the above novel
phenomena, we learned from our review of the literature that
the Au–Ge–Yb (AGY) system belongs to the 1/1 AC of a
Tsai-type icosahedral QC. According to Lin and Corbett,7) the
AGY system has two types of crystal structure: one contains
14 at. % Yb and the other 16 at. % Yb atoms. Almost four
non-Yb (i.e., Au and Ge) atoms occupy the center of the Tsai-
type cluster in the former compound as in the case of AAY,8)
while, in the latter one, there is only a “rattling” Yb atom at
the center of the cluster.9) Hereafter, the former and latter ACs
are referred to as AGY(I) and AGY(II), respectively.
In this Letter, we report on our low-temperature experi-
ments on the electrical resistivity, magnetization, ac magnetic
susceptibility, and speciﬁc heat of the AGY(I) and AGY(II)
ACs. We observe that both of the ACs show super-
conductivity with transition temperatures Tc of 0.68 K for
AGY(I) and 0.36 K for AGY(II). We further observe that the
magnetization is much larger in the AGY(II) AC than in the
AGY(I) AC. To explain this observation, we propose a model
in which the cluster-center Yb ion in AGY(II) is magnetic.
We also discuss the relationship between magnetism and
superconductivity in these new systems.
Two types of polycrystalline sample, Au86xGexYb14
(20  x  24) and Au84yGeyYb16 (18  y  22), were
synthesized with the starting materials 4N (99.99% pure)-
Au, 5N-Ge, and 3N-Yb. (Note that the composition is
nominal throughout the paper.) For both alloys, the starting
materials were put in an alumina crucible, sealed in an
evacuated quartz tube, and heated to 1000 °C. Then, the
crucible was cooled to 800 °C. After it was subsequently
cooled slowly to 450 °C, the crucible was rapidly quenched
in water for the synthesis of AGY(I), while it was slowly
cooled in the furnace for the synthesis of AGY(II).
Structure analysis was carried out by a powder X-ray
diffraction technique using Cu K-radiation; details of the
experiments are described elsewhere.8) The dc magnetization
was measured using a commercial SQUID magnetometer in
the temperature range between 1.8 and 300 K, and at magnetic
ﬁelds of up to 70 kOe. Four-terminal resistivity measurements
were performed using ac methods. Ac magnetic susceptibility
was measured using a driving ac magnetic ﬁeld of 0.1 Oe
at a frequency of 100.3 Hz. The speciﬁc heat measurement
was performed by a conventional quasi-adiabatic heat-pulse
method. The electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility,
and speciﬁc heat measurements with zero dc magnetic ﬁeld
were carried out in a 3He cryostat down to 0.25 K, and the
resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements at
magnetic ﬁelds of up to 80 kOe were carried out in a dilution
refrigerator down to 0.08 K.
Figure 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of
Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0, both of which
show a body-centered cubic structure with lattice parameters
of 1.4724(2) and 1.4605(4) nm, respectively. Note that the
alloy with a higher Yb concentration has a smaller lattice
parameter, as pointed out in Ref. 7.
The Rietveld structure analysis of the former successfully
converged and indicated that the sample with an optimal
composition x ¼ 64:0 is of single phase and its cluster-center
tetrahedron is orientationally disordered.10) For the latter,
on the other hand, the predominant phase has an optimal
composition of y ¼ 63:5 and the sample contains a small
amount of an unidentiﬁed phase. The inclusion of the
secondary phase prevented the complete Rietveld reﬁnement.
In the present study, we assume following Lin and Corbett
that, there is a single Yb atom at the cluster center in the latter
system.7,9) As a result, AGY(I) and AGY(II) denote Au64.0-
Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0, respectively.

©2015 The Physical Society of JapanFigure 2 shows two structure models, both of which are
composed of the Tsai-type cluster, i.e., concentric shells of
a dodecahedron, an icosahedron, and an icosidodecahedron.
Note that the “Yb1” site at the vertex of the icosahedron is
exclusively occupied by the Yb atom. The structure model of
the AGY(I) AC is similar to that of the AAY AC; the cluster
center is occupied by Au atoms with a probability of
approximately 0.27 (Ref. 10), which is close to 1/3 in the
case of a randomly oriented tetrahedron. In contrast, in the
structure model of the AGY(II) AC, the cluster center is
occupied by a single Yb atom (“Yb2” site).
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependences of the
magnetic susceptibilities of the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs.
For comparison, we also plot the susceptibility data of the
AAY AC.6) For the analysis described below, the magnetic
susceptibilities of AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs are plotted in
unit per cluster (see the left vertical axis), including 12 and 13
Yb atoms, respectively, while that of the AAY AC is given in
unit per Yb ion (the right vertical axis). The AGY(I) AC
shows an almost T-independent diamagnetic susceptibility
 ¼ 1:6  104 emu/mol-cluster at high temperatures, and
shows a Curie-like rise in ðTÞ in the lowest-temperature
region measured. The latter rise seems extrinsic because the
low-temperature magnetization MðHÞ saturates at a low
magnetic ﬁeld; as shown in Fig. 3(b), MðHÞ is only 9:6 

©2015 The Physical Society of Japanthat the T-constant diamagnetism arises as a result of
the cancellation between the paramagnetic contribution of
conduction electrons and the diamagnetic contribution of
ion cores. Since the latter susceptibility is estimated to
be 1:8  103 emu/mol-cluster from the ion core sus-
ceptibility given in the literature,11) the Pauli suscepti-
bility is evaluated as 1:6  103 emu/mol-cluster. Using

B  1, which is expected for a noncorrelated
electron system. As a result, the observed magnetism of the
AGY(I) AC can be understood by assuming that all the Yb
ions (i.e., the Yb1-site ions at the vertex of the icosahedron)
are in the nonmagnetic Yb2+ state.12)
In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility of the AGY(II) AC
(containing both the Yb1- and Yb2-site ions) behaves like
that of the AAY AC. Assuming that ðTÞ ¼ 0 þ 4fðTÞ [0
and 4fðTÞ are T-independent and T-dependent contributions
to the susceptibility, respectively], we ﬁnd that, for T > 80 K,
4fðTÞ follows the Curie–Weiss law with an effective Bohr
magneton eff ¼ 3:5 B/cluster and a Weiss temperature
T ¼ 104 K. Note that this effective magnetic moment
per cluster is close to 3.8 B/Yb of the AAY AC. Since
the constant term 0 ¼ 4:8  103 emu/mol-cluster is also
considered as additive contributions of conduction electrons
and ion cores, the Pauli paramagnetism of the AGY(II) AC is
estimated to be 6:8  103 emu/mol-cluster from the ion
core diamagnetism of 2:0  103 emu/mol-cluster. As-
suming   251 mJ/(K20mol-cluster) at high temperatures,
we obtain a Wilson ratio RW  2, which suggests the
possibility that the 4f electrons would contribute to the
itinerant electron magnetism.
Let us make a comparison between the AGY(II) AC and
the AAY AC. The solid line in Fig. 3(a) indicates that
4fðTÞ ¼ aAAYðTÞ, where a is an adjustable parameter and
found to be 0.9 and AAYðTÞ is a measured susceptibility (per
mole of Yb ion) of the AAY AC. We ﬁnd good coincidence
between the solid curve and the data points, suggesting that
Yb ions in the AGY(II) AC are similar in nature to those in
the AAY AC.
Figure 3(b) shows the magnetization curves for the
AGY(I), AGY(II), and AAY ACs. We ascribe the small
magnetization of the AGY(I) AC to a paramagnetic impurity
effect. The solid line indicates that MðHÞ ¼ 0H þ M4fðHÞ,
where M4fðHÞ ¼ aMAAYðHÞ [a ¼ 0:9 and MAAYðHÞ is a
measured magnetization of the AAY AC per Yb ion]. Again,
we ﬁnd good agreement between the solid curve and the
data points. Taking account of the results (i) that the
magnetization per cluster (containing 12 Yb1-site ions and
1 Yb2-site ion) in the AGY(II) AC is similar in magnitude to
that per Yb ion in the AAY AC and (ii) that 12 Yb1-site ions
are all nonmagnetic in the AGY(I) AC, we propose a model
showing that, in the AGY(II) AC, the Yb1-site Yb ions are all
nonmagnetic and the Yb2-site Yb ion behaves like the Yb
ions in the AAY AC. This implies that the AGY(II) AC has a
heterogeneous Yb valence.
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependences of the
electrical resistivities ðTÞ of the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs.
The T-independent feature with a large residual resistivity
[see inset of Fig. 4(a)] is characteristic of ACs as well as QCs
with Tsai-type clusters. The electrical resistivities of both
materials sharply drop to zero, indicating the emergence of
superconductivity. By deﬁning the transition temperature Tc
as the midpoint of the resistivity drop, we obtain Tc ¼ 0:68
and 0.36 K for the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, respectively.
Figure 4(b) shows the temperature dependences of the real
parts of the ac magnetic susceptibilities 0ðTÞ of the AGY(I)
and AGY(II) ACs with zero external dc magnetic ﬁeld.
Below Tc, there emerges a clear diamagnetic signal due to the
superconducting shielding effect. When deﬁning Tc as the
onset of diamagnetism, we ﬁnd that the Tc values deduced
from the susceptibility and resistivity coincide with each
other.
Detailed studies of the ﬁeld-dependent resistivity and ac
susceptibility allow us to determine the upper critical ﬁeld
Hc2ðTÞ; see the inset of Fig. 4(b). Just below Tc, we observe a
linear T dependence with gradients of dHc2=dT ¼ 5:84 and
6.75 kOe/K for the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, respectively.

©2015 The Physical Society of JapanThe orbital critical ﬁeld at zero temperature is estimated using
this slope via the Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg formula
Horb
c2 ð0Þ ¼ 0:693Tc dHc2=dT, and the results are summariz-
ed in Table I, together with the Hc2ð0Þ values obtained by
extrapolating the data to zero temperature. We ﬁnd that
Horb
c2 ð0Þ is close to Hc2ð0Þ for both materials, suggesting that
the orbital depairing mechanism dominantly contributes to
the Hc2 of these ACs.
To check if the superconductivity is of bulk origin, we
measured the speciﬁc heat CðTÞ. In the normal state, CðTÞ
can be well ﬁtted using the conventional formula CðTÞ ¼
T þ 	T3 (2 < T < 5 K) with  ¼ 109 and 251 mJ/(K20mol-
cluster), and 	 ¼ 40:8 and 41.1 mJ/(K40mol-cluster) for the
AGY(I)
and
AGY(II)
ACs,
respectively.
Using
	 ¼
124NR=53
D (R is the gas constant and N is the number
of atoms), we estimate the Debye temperature to be D ¼
160
and
157 K
for
the
AGY(I)
and
AGY(II)
ACs,
respectively. Then, by subtracting the phonon contribution
of CðTÞ, we evaluate the electronic speciﬁc heat CeðTÞ. In
Fig. 4(c), we plot Ce=T as a function of temperature. A clear
jump is observed at Tc: the thin solid line indicates the
T dependence calculated using entropy balance. The jump
height is Ce=Tc ¼ 138 and 218 mJ/(K20mol-cluster) and
therefore Ce=CeðTcÞ is 1.26 and 0.54 for the AGY(I) and
AGY(II) ACs, respectively. These values indicate the bulk
superconductivity and suggest that, if the 4f electrons would
be itinerant, then they are involved in Cooper pair formation.
In the normal state, the AGY(II) AC shows a logarithmic
increase in Ce=T at low temperatures in contrast to the
AGY(I) AC: the solid line in Fig. 4(c) indicates a ﬁtted result
using the expression Ce=T  ðS=TÞ lnðT=TÞ with T ¼
33 K and S ¼ 2860 ¼ 0:5R ln 2 mJ/(K0mol-cluster). Such a
logarithmic T dependence was observed in UPt3,13) which
allows us to suggest the possibility of an unconventional
pairing mechanism related to the magnetism.
The superconducting parameters of these materials are
summarized in Table I. They are evaluated using the
knowledge of Tc, Hc2ðTÞ and Ce=Tc as follows: The GL
parameter ¬ at T ¼ Tc is deduced from the relation 4 
1:16  ð2
2  1ÞCe=Tc ¼ ðdHc2=dTÞ2, and we assume that

ð0Þ ’ 
 from Hc2ð0Þ ’ Horb
c2 ð0Þ. Note that the large ¬ values
exceeding 20 indicate that both materials are type II super-
conductors. The coherence length ð0Þ is estimated from
Hc2ð0Þ ¼ 0=2ð0Þ2, where 0 is a ﬂux quantum. The
penetration depth is estimated from the relation ð0Þ ¼

ð0Þð0Þ. The thermodynamic critical ﬁeld is evaluated
from Hcð0Þ ¼ Hc2ð0Þ=

p

ð0Þ. Finally, the lower critical
ﬁeld
is
estimated
using
the
formula
Hc1ð0ÞHc2ð0Þ ¼
Hcð0Þ2½ln 
ð0Þ þ 0:08. As seen in Table I, we ﬁnd no clear
difference in the superconducting parameter, ð0Þ, ð0Þ, or

ð0Þ for the AGY(I) or AGY(II) AC.
We consider two possibilities for the relationship between
magnetism and superconductivity: (i) The superconductivity
mechanisms are different between AGY(I) and AGY(II), and
the magnetism stabilizes the superconductivity for the latter.
(ii) The superconductivity mechanism is common between
them and the magnetism destabilizes the superconductivity
for the latter. At the present stage, it is unclear which of those
possibilities is probable: we need further investigations.
In summary, we synthesized two Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with
a nominal composition, Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 [AGY(I)] and
Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0 [AGY(II)]. By low-temperature experi-
ments
on
their
electrical
resistivity,
magnetization,
ac
magnetic susceptibility, and speciﬁc heat, we showed that
they are the ﬁrst superconductors among Tsai-type QCs and
ACs. To account for the different magnetic properties of
AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, we proposed a model in which
Yb ion located at the Tsai-type cluster center, which exists
only in the AGY(II) AC, is magnetic while the other Yb ions
located at the vertex of the icosahedron are nonmagnetic. We
further discussed the possible effect of the cluster-center
magnetic Yb ion on superconductivity. We hope that the
present study stimulates further search for superconducting
QC and AC, and research on the relationship between
magnetism and superconductivity as well.
