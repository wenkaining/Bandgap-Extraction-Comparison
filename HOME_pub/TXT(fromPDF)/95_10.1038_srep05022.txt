Controlled fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures is an essential step in engineering of high
performance photonic and optoelectronic devices. Diamond in particular has recently attracted
considerable attention as a promising platform for quantum technologies, photonics and high resolution
sensing applications. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of optically active, functional diamond structures
using gas-mediated electron beam induced etching (EBIE). The technique achieves dry chemical etching at
room temperature through the dissociation of surface-adsorbed H2O molecules by energetic electrons in a
water vapor environment. Parallel processing is possible by electron flood exposure and the use of an etch
mask, while high resolution, mask-free, iterative editing is demonstrated by direct write etching of inclined
facets of diamond microparticles. The realized structures demonstrate the potential of EBIE for the
fabrication of optically active structures in diamond.
D
iamond, long considered unconquerable due to its extraordinary strength and chemical resistance, has
found applications across numerous areas of science due to its unique combination of optical, electronic,
chemical and thermal properties1. Most notably, the nitrogen vacancy luminescence center (NV) has been
employed as a spin qubit, enabling the use of diamond as a platform for next generation sensing, nanophotonic
and quantum devices2–8. These tantalizing applications are, however, overshadowed by challenges in fabrication
arising from its extraordinary hardness and chemical resistance.
At present, diamond fabrication requires cumbersome masking techniques, and ion bombardment or high
power laser ablation, which often causes damage and material redeposition artifacts9–13. Fabrication and editing of
optoelectronic grade nanostructures is therefore extremely limited relative to conventional semiconductors such
as silicon and gallium arsenide. Furthermore, direct-write, deterministic patterning of optical structures in
diamond has not been demonstrated in the absence of severe surface damage caused by ion implantation and
redeposition of non-volatile, sputtered or ablated material.
Here we demonstrate the fabrication of functional, optically active diamond structures using gas-mediated
electron beam induced etching (EBIE)14–18 (Figure 1). EBIE achieves dry chemical etching at room temperature in
a water vapor environment through the electron-induced dissociation of surface-adsorbed H2O molecules,
generating reactive fragments that give rise to volatilization of carbon. The reaction steps are shown in
Figure 1b–c. The process utilizes low energy electrons which do not cause damage through knock-on displace-
ment of carbon, sputtering and staining that are characteristic of focused ion beam milling, and cause quenching
of diamond luminescence14,19. Parallel processing is possible by electron flood exposure and the use of an etch
mask. Mask-free EBIE is used to realize direct-write subtractive 3D printing of diamond nanostructures on
inclined planes of diamond microparticles. The processes are demonstrated using a variable pressure scanning
electron microscope (SEM) making diamond nanofabrication accessible to most nanotechnology laboratories in
the world.
To demonstrate the applicability of EBIE to device fabrication, we start by fabricating a pillar from a single
crystal diamond using an etch mask. Pillars are used as antennas that enhance light extraction from embedded
emitters, particularly of high refractive index semiconductors. The EBIE process is shown schematically in
Figure 2a–c. The mask must either absorb the incident electrons or prevent H2O from adsorbing to the diamond
substrate. Here we use a silica mask to prevent low-energy (2 keV) electrons from penetrating into underlying
regions of diamond. The resulting pillars (Figure 2d) have high aspect ratios and straight side-walls, making them
ideal for photonic applications. The minimum pillar diameter is ultimately limited by the diameter of the
interaction volume of a delta function electron beam, which scales super-linearly20 with electron energy. In
diamond, it is equal to ,19 nm at 2 keV, and ,9 nm at 1 keV, as shown in Figure 2e21. Nanostructures can

1therefore be fabricated with high resolution using the correct com-
bination of mask diameter and electron energy. On the other hand,
micron sized depths can be achieved, enabling high aspect ratio
geometries.
Optical properties of the pillars are shown by the fluorescence and
Raman scattering data in Figure 3. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra
were recorded using a confocal microscope with a 532 nm excitation
laser. The PL intensity of the pillar (Figure 3a) shows a two-fold
increase over the neighboring, unprocessed region of diamond
(under identical PL collection conditions). Raman spectroscopy
(Figure 3b) shows no evidence of graphitic inclusions in the irra-
diated area with the first-order diamond peak positioned at
1332 cm21 and FWHM of ,3.6 cm21, consistent with the Raman
signature of pristine, single crystal diamond22,23.
Next, we demonstrate the capability of EBIE for mask-free editing
of inclined diamond surfaces. Editing of multiple inclined facets is
nearly impossible by mask-based processing techniques, including
electron- and photo-lithography. To demonstrate the three dimen-
sional capability of writing on inclined surfaces, we patterned the
letters ‘UTS’ and ‘NANO’ into individual microparticles (Figure 4)
simply by tracing out the letters using an electron beam as shown
schematically in Figure 1d. Etching was carried out using a 20 keV
electron beam, while charging was stabilized using a low vacuum
(13 Pa) environment of H2O. The letters are clearly visible in SEM
images (Figure 4a), while atomic force microscope (AFM) maps of
the ‘UTS’ logo show line widths and depths of ,100 nm (Figure 4b).
The letters ‘NANO’ were written intentionally across three diamond
(111) facets, showing the ability of EBIE to edit three dimensional,
inclined nanostructures. Figure 4c shows an individual diamond
microparticle with visible (111) facets and Figure 4e shows the word
‘NANO’ imprinted in the crystal, with the letters ‘NA’, ‘N’ and ‘O’,
occupying all three (111) planes, respectively. PL measurements
recorded from the diamond microparticles exhibit strong fluor-
escence, confirming that the etch process does not destroy optical
properties

functionality
(See

Information). The mask-less patterning approach is particularly
attractive for generation of high resolution microfluidic channels
in microdiamond crystals, in close proximity to optical emitters24,25.
The potential of EBIE exceeds that of traditional etching tech-
niques for wide bandgap semiconductors. For instance, a combina-
tion of EBIE with cathodoluminescence analysis techniques may
enable probing of the spectroscopic properties of nanostructures
while the etch parameters are modified during fabrication.
Alternatively, substrate tilting can enable fabrication of undercut
structures that are currently not available in diamond. Finally, the
EBIE method will be pivotal for realizing hybrid devices when direct
sculpting of a nanostructure is required to achieve close proximity
with an external cavity or metallic nanostructure26.
We have demonstrated a promising approach to pattern and
sculpt optically active diamond structures using two variants of
H2O-mediated electron induced chemical etching: a mask-based

2lithographic approach, and an extremely versatile, direct-write edit-
ing process. For the first time, direct 3D writing is realized on various
facets of a single microparticle. PL and Raman analysis were used to
show that the unique optical properties of diamond are maintained
and no graphitization occurs. By leveraging the advanced function-
alities provided by a conventional SEM in conjunction with EBIE a
modification to existing devices and direct nanofabrication for rapid
prototyping is enabled. EBIE is the first step towards rendering 3D
single crystal diamond geometries for high performance photonic,
sensing and quantum devices.
Methods
EBIE of diamond pillar. EBIE was performed using a FEI Nova NanoSEM variable
pressure27 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a magnetic immersion
lens gaseous secondary electron detector28. The SEM chamber was pumped to 3 3
1024 Pa prior to performing EBIE at room temperature under 13 Pa of H2O (Milli-Q)
precursor vapor. Pillars were fabricated using dispersed 2 mm silica beads that served
as a hard mask on a 100 oriented single crystal diamond (Element Six). Silica beads
were transferred from a suspension in isopropyl alcohol, which was flash dried to
remove the solvent. Single beads were located in the SEM before irradiation. H2O
mediated EBIE was performed by irradiating a 10 mm 3 8 mm rectangle with a 2 keV,
29.9 nA electron beam for 12 hours, using a dwell time of 1.34 ms per pixel. Electron
penetration and energy deposition profiles were calculated using standard Monte
Carlo models of electron-solid interactions21,29.
Optical measurements. PL measurements were performed at room temperature
using a custom built confocal microscope with a 532 nm excitation laser. Raman
measurements were performed using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with a
633 nm excitation laser.
EBIE of diamond micro particles. Diamond micro-particles were grown using a
CVD method (,950 W, 1% methane, 8 3 103 Pa). The particles were transferred to a
platinum surface prior to EBIE. The ‘UTS’ symbol was etched into a single particle
using a 20 keV, 9.9 nA electron beam controlled using a custom pattern generator
connected to the SEM scan coils. The dwell time per pixel was 256 ms and the total
process time ,15 mins. The symbol ‘NANO’ was etched using the same conditions,
but etch letter was etched individually into the diamond. The ‘UTS’ symbol was
measured ex situ using the tapping mode of a DI Dimension 3100 atomic force
microscope (AFM), and analyzed using the software package Gwyddion30.
