Total and partial density of states, frequency dependent complex refractive index including extinction
coefﬁcient, optical conductivity and transmission of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) in rocksalt and wurtzite
phases are calculated using full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method. The
real part of refractive index decreases while the extinction coefﬁcient, optical conductivity and
transmission for rocksalt phase increases with the increase in Mg concentration. In wurtzite phase,
ordinary and extraordinary indices decrease while extinction coefﬁcient, optical conductivity and
transmission increase in parallel as well as perpendicular to c-axis with the increase in the Mg
concentration.

1. Introduction
ZnO is a key semiconductor compound with a wide bandgap,
large binding energy and high chemical, mechanical and thermal
stability [1]. It is intensively studied due to its numerous
applications in sensors, transducers, catalysts, laser diodes, light
emitting diodes, solar cells, heat mirrors, transparent electrodes,
varistors and surface acoustic wave devices [2–10]. While, MgO is
another promising insulating metal oxide with various technolo-
gical applications in different ﬁelds due to its very wide bandgap
as well as thermal and chemical stability [11]. It is used as a
substrate [12] and catalyst [13]. It is also used in superconductor
products [14], thermal shock transducers, protecting layers for AC
plasma display panels [15] and spintronics devices [16].
Mg doped ZnO is frequently used in optoelectronic and
magneto-electronic devices [17–22]. MgxZn1xO in wurtzite and
cubic rocksalt form has been grown experimentally using differ-
ent experimental techniques [23–31]. Its structural, electronic,
optical and thermal properties have been theoretically investi-
gated by different ab-initio methods [22,32–40]. However so far,
no theoretical work has been reported on the refractive index
optical conductivity and transmission of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1)
alloys using density functional calculation.
In the present work we extend the theoretical work of Amrani
et al. [33] and Chen and Ye [40] to the ground state optical
response of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) in RS(B1) and WZ(B4), respec-
tively, using Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave
Method with Perdew et al. [41] potential in the generalized
gradient approximation. In optical response we discussed in
detail the optical properties: refractive index including extinction
coefﬁcient, optical conductivity and transmission of the alloy.
2. Theory and calculations
Optical properties provide useful information about the inter-
nal structure of a material. Wide range of physical properties of a
ternary compound makes it more suitable than a binary com-
pound for many technological applications. Keeping this in mind
we investigate the refractive index, optical conductivity and
transmission of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1). The refractive indices of
ternary oxides are important optical design parameters, e.g. for
distributed Bragg reﬂectors (DBRs) in vertical cavity surface
emitting lasers [42].

DFT has become an unchallenging ‘‘standard model’’ in mate-
rial science due to its strong predictive power and successful
results with wide applicability. We used DFT with the generalized
gradient approximation [41] in the wien2k package to solve the
Kohan Sham equations using full potential linear augmented
plane wave (FP-LAPW) technique [46]. For the crystal potential,
mufﬁn-tin model was assumed. The unit cell was divided into two
parts, within and outside the mufﬁn-tin. The electrons density
within the mufﬁn-tin is core and outside is valance. The core
electrons were treated relativistically, whereas the valence elec-
trons were treated non-relativistically. In both regions of the unit
cell, different basis sets were used to expand the wave function.
A linear combination of radial solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion times the spherical harmonics was used for the inside of the
non-overlapping spheres of mufﬁn-tin radius (RMT), around each
atom. While plane wave basis set was used in the interstitial
region. RMT was chosen in such a way that there was no charge
leakage from the core and total energy convergence was ensured.
RMT values of 1.87, 2.02 and 1.79 a.u. were used for Mg, Zn and O,
respectively. Inside the atomic spheres maximum value of angu-
lar momentum lmax¼10 was taken for the wave function expan-
sion. For wave function in the interstitial region the plane wave
cut-off value of Kmax¼7/RMT for binaries MgO and ZnO while 10
for ternaries Mg0.25Zn0.75O, Mg0.50Zn0.50O and Mg0.75Zn0.25O was
used. A mesh of 4000 k-points for the MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) in RS
(B1) and 550 for WZ (B4) was taken for the Brillouin zone
integrations in the corresponding irreducible wedge to calculate
optical properties.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Density of states
Total and partial density of states for MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) in
RS and WZ phases are calculated and presented in Fig. 1. In the
ﬁgure the density of states (DOS) for WZ phase are plotted, while
due to the similar trend it is not shown for RS. In pure ZnO, the
upper part of the valence band (VB) is mainly composed of Zn-3d
states while the lower part of this band is occupied by O-2p states

2633along with a noticeable contribution from the hybridization of
Zn-3d and O-2p states. The mixing of valence states above the
Fermi level forms the conduction band. For all the ternary alloys
the distribution of the states are almost the same as of pure ZnO
except Mg-3p states, which also contribute to CB. The ﬁgure also
reveals that for pure MgO the major contribution to the VB and
lower part of CB comes from O-2p states, while upper part of CB is
mainly composed of Mg-3p states. The calculated DOS for
both the phases of ZnO and MgO are in agreement with that of
Ref. [35]. The trend in the DOS in the RS and the WZ is the same;
however there are some small differences, i.e. DOS in the WZ is
higher than in the RS.
3.2. Complex refractive index
For accurate modeling and designing of optical materials for
devices, knowledge of the dispersion of the refractive indices of
the medium is necessary. Rocksalt (RS) materials have cubic
symmetry and therefore have isotropic properties, while wurtzite
structures (WZ) lack cubic symmetry and therefore have aniso-
tropic optical properties. The anisotropy results in uniaxial
birefringence in wurtzite compounds. The one in the parallel
direction to the c-axis is called ordinary (no) while the perpendi-
cular one is called extraordinary (ne) [5].
The calculated frequency dependent refractive index for
MgxZn1xO, at x¼0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0, is shown in Fig. 3.
The critical points (zero frequency limits) of refractive indices at
x¼0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 are plotted against Mg concentration
in Fig. 2 for rocksalt (RS) and wurtzite (WZ) structures. It is clear
from the ﬁgure that the refractive index for each structure
decreases with the increase in magnesium concentration in the
ZnO crystal. It is also clear from the plot that the refractive index
for rocksalt is higher than that for the wurtzite.
In rocksalt phase, the zero frequency limit of frequency
dependent refractive index for pure ZnO is 1.95. It increases from
1.95 with the increase in energy and reaches to its maximum
value (peak value) of 2.37 at 3.58 eV. On further increase in the
incident photon energy beyond the peak value the refractive
index of pure ZnO dissipates with somewhat oscillations. It falls
below 1 in the range 16.31–47.58 eV except for 29.73–31.06 eV.
For the wurtzite phase of ZnO, the refractive index remains
isotropic except in the range 10–20 eV, with the zero frequency
limits 1.797 for parallel and 1.808 for perpendicular to c-axis.
The calculated refractive indices at 0.4 eV are 1.80 and 1.81
corresponding to parallel and perpendicular to c-axis, respec-
tively, which are closer to the experimental results 1.93 and 1.96,
respectively [47]. Our calculated results for both parallel and
perpendicular parts of the refractive index are also in excellent
agreement with the results of Yoshikawa and Adachi [48]. The
refractive index for pure wurtzite ZnO falls below 1 in the range
14.92–47.52 eV for both axis. It is a well established fact that the
group velocity of a wave packet in a medium travels faster than
the speed of light (c) for refractive index lesser than 1. Hence
the group velocity is faster than c for rocksalt ZnO in the range
16.31–47.58 eV except 29.73–31.06 eV and for wurtzite ZnO in
the range 14.92–47.52 eV. In other words the group velocity shifts
to negative domain and the material does not stay linear but
becomes nonlinear for these energy ranges and hence becomes
super-luminous.
By increasing the Mg concentration in ZnO for MgxZn1xO, the
peak value of the refractive index shifts towards higher energies for
both the phases, which is clear from Fig. 2. When all the Zn atoms are
replaced by Mg in the crystal, the peak value of the refractive index
of the pure RS-MgO (1.89) occurs at 10.2 eV and WZ-MgO (1.67) at
6.1 eV. Our calculated ground state refractive index of RS-MgO, 1.55,
is closer to the room temperature experimental refractive index, 1.72
[49]. Overall, by the change in the Mg concentration in the ZnO
crystal, we can obtain different refractive indices. For zero frequency
limits they range from 1.95 to 1.55 in RS and for peak values they lie
between 2.37 and 1.89, with the shift in energy from lower toward
higher. Similarly, in WZ phase it varies from 1.797 to 1.428 parallel
and 1.808 to 1.438 perpendicular to the c-axis.
Extinction coefﬁcient against energy is also shown in Fig. 2 for
both the RS and WZ phases. Critical values for the extinction
coefﬁcient of MgxZn1xO, at x¼0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 are 1.6,
2.05, 2.55, 3.1 and 5.1 eV, respectively, for RS phase while 1.2, 1.7,
2.06, 2.8 and 5.8 eV, respectively, for parallel as well as perpendi-
cular to c-axis of the WZ phase. In pure RS-ZnO, the prominent
peaks are at 12.4 and 16 eV. When we replace Zn by Mg in the
RS-ZnO crystal, the positions of the peaks shift toward higher
energy values until all the Zn atoms are replaced by Mg and it is
noted that (for RS-MgO) the prominent peaks are at 14.2, 16.4 and
19.9 eV. It is further noted that the maximum peak in RS-ZnO is at
16.06 eV, while in RS-MgO it occurs at 19.87 eV. Thus by increas-
ing Mg concentration in the RS-ZnO crystal, the overall response
of the material to the applied energy ﬁeld shifts toward higher
energy in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.

2634In WZ phase, the same trend is observed for the peak values of the
extinction coefﬁcient parallel to the c-axis from 14.84 to 17.62 eV,
while in the perpendicular part it decreases with the increase in the
Mg concentration, from 13.67 to 12.20 eV. The anisotropy found in
the parallel and perpendicular parts of the extinction coefﬁcient for
WZ-ZnO is in the range 6.8–17.5 eV and for WZ-MgO in the range
6.89–29 eV, while the ternary alloys are isotropic for most of the
energies. The calculated refractive index and extinction coefﬁcient
show that MgxZn1xO in both phases is suitable for optoelectronic
applications in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.
3.3. Optical conductivity
Optical conductivity, s(o), of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) is shown in
Fig. 4 for both phases. The critical points for MgxZn1xO at x¼0,
0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 are 2.6, 3.05, 3.5, 4.12 and 5.5 eV,
respectively, for RS phase and 1.3, 2.06, 2.65, 3.68 and 5.80 eV,
respectively, for WZ phase. In pure RS-ZnO, there are three
signiﬁcant peaks at 12.6, 15 and 31 eV with a maximum value of
6882.79 O cm1 at 14.84 eV. The most interesting peak is the
middle one, around 15 eV, which increases with the increase in the
Mg concentration till 25% and on further increase it starts decreas-
ing. The peak at around 20 eV is also appealing, as it increases with
the increase in the Mg concentration and becomes prominent for
pure RS-MgO. It is further noted that the maximum peak value of
conductivity shifts from 14.84 to 19.6 eV.
Similar trends are also observed for the optical conductivity
parallel as well as perpendicular to c-axis. The maximum con-
ductivity for WZ-ZnO is 6201.52 O cm1 at 13.18 eV for parallel
to c-axis and 6763 O cm1 at 13.59 eV for perpendicular to c-axis.
While in the WZ-MgO, maximum conductivity parallel to c-axis is
4312.83 O cm1 at 16.37 eV and perpendicular to c-axis is
5188.04 O cm1 at 16.34 eV. Hence with the increase in Mg
concentration,
the
peak
value
of
the
optical
conductivity
decreases and shifts toward higher energies for both parallel
and perpendicular components to c-axis. The anisotropy observed
in optical conductivity of WZ-ZnO is in the range 11.4–30 eV and
that of WZ-MgO is 6.89–29 eV, while the ternary compound
MgxZn1xO is almost isotropic.
3.4. Transmission
Transmission spectra of MgxZn1xO, for both the phases, are
calculated for the incident photon energies up to 7.0 eV using
Eq. (6) and are plotted in Fig. 5. For RS-ZnO the transmission is
almost 100% in the lower energies below 1 eV and then it starts
decreasing exponentially and dies to zero near the absorption edge
of the material. Similar trends are also observed for RS-MgO as well
as
for
its
ternary
RS-Mg0.50Zn0.50O
compounds.
For
uniaxial
WZ-MgxZn1xO, the
material
remains isotropic
in
the
range
0.0–7.0 eV for both transmissions parallel as well as perpendicular
to c-axis. Transmission parallel to c-axis is plotted in Fig. 5. From the
plot it is clear that the exponential decrease in WZ-ZnO is faster than
RS-ZnO but the transmission edge comes beyond RS-ZnO. Similar
trend is also observed for WZ-Mg0.50Zn0.50O. It is further noted from
the ﬁgure that the transmission for both phases of MgO remains
similar for most energies, while the transmission in WZ-MgO decays
earlier than RS-MgO. For both phases the transmission increases
with the Mg concentration in the ZnO crystal and the transmission
edge shifts toward higher energies in the ultraviolet region of the
spectrum. The results obtained from the present density functional
calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimentally
measured transmission of WZ-ZnO [31] and WZ-MgxZn1xO [30]
and are also in agreement with the experimental results of
MgxZn1xO in rocksalt and wurtzite [31].
4. Conclusion
Density of states, refraction, optical conductivity and trans-
mission of MgxZn1xO (0rxr1) in rocksalt and wurtzite struc-
tures are theoretically investigated by FP-LAPW method. The
calculated refractive index shows that the material stays linear
for energies lesser than 17 eV in RS and 15 eV in WZ and becomes
nonlinear beyond this. The increase of x in MgxZn1xO crystal
suppresses the overall refraction and conductivity except for the
sharp peak value at around 19.90 eV in RS and 16.3 eV in WZ,
which enhances. Transmission of the alloy in both phases
increases with the increase in Mg concentration. High response
of the compound in the energy range 10–20 eV conﬁrms the
importance of the material in the UV optoelectronic devices.
