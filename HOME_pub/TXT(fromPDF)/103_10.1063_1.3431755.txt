It is commonly believed that organic molecules are physisorbed on the ideal nonpolar surfaces of
wide band gap insulators with limited variation in the electronic properties of the adsorbate
molecule. On the basis of ﬁrst principles calculations within density functional theory DFT and
GW approximation, we show that this is not generally true. We ﬁnd that the molecular frontier
orbitals undergo signiﬁcant changes when a hydroxy acid here we chose gluconic acid is adsorbed
on MgSO4·H2O100 surface due to the complex interaction between the molecule and the
insulating surface. The predicted trend of the adsorption effect on the energy gap obtained by DFT
is reversed when the surface polarization effect is taken into account via the many-body
corrections. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. doi:10.1063/1.3431755
Organic-insulator systems are regaining increasing inter-
est in recent years stimulated by the rapid development of
novel molecular-scale devices.1 The performance of these
molecular electronics relies intimately on the properties of
the frontier orbitals of the organic molecule2 and the cou-
pling of the orbitals to the surface electronic states. From this
point of view, an accurate control of the electrical character-
istics requires unambiguous knowledge of the interaction be-
tween the molecular adsorbate and insulating surface.
The perfect nonpolar surface of a wide band gap insula-
tor, e.g., alkali halides is chemically inert with respect to
organic molecules, and the features of the molecular orbitals
are usually preserved upon adsorption as resolved by scan-
ning
tunneling
spectroscopy3
and
ﬁrst
principles
calculations.4 The ability to decouple adsorbed molecules
electrically from the insulating surface also facilitates the use
of alkali halides as supporting templates for a wide range of
applications.5–7 However, as we will show in this study, this
scenario does not necessarily hold for all organic-insulator
systems. In contrast, we ﬁnd that using density functional
theory DFT, the frontier orbitals of an adsorbate can vary
signiﬁcantly upon adsorption on the surface of a wide band
gap insulator. Here we choose gluconic acid GA as a rep-
resentative for the chemical class of hydroxy acids adsorbed
on MgSO4·H2O100 as the subject of investigation. Apart
from the general relevance of the adsorption properties of
this wide spread class of molecules, our study is also moti-
vated by the ability of this molecule to act as a conditioner
for the electrostatic separation of minerals.5 We show that the
strong variations in the frontier orbitals arise from the com-
plex interactions between the adsorbate and the underlying
surface. Further, the polarization effect, which is induced by
changes in the charge state of the molecule, produces a
prominent reduction in the molecular energy gap upon ad-
sorption. The description of the polarization invokes the use
of the GW approximation8 since this nonlocal correlation
effect is not captured by Kohn–Sham KS DFT eigenvalues
with standard exchange-correlation XC approximations.
We
stress
that
the
results,
although
based
on
the
GA-MgSO4·H2O system, should provide a more general in-
sight into the interaction of a wide class of organic molecules
e.g., carboxylic and phenylic acids on insulating surfaces.
We
start
with
a
brief
description
of
the
bulk
MgSO4·H2O. MgSO4·H2O
has a monoclinic structure
space group C2h
6  and is chemically formed from MgSO4 by
incorporating one water molecule per unit. The crystal struc-
ture parameters were calculated with the Perdew–Burke–
Ernzerhof PBE XC potential9 within the generalized gradi-
ent approximation GGA as implemented in VASP.10 The
electron-ion interaction was described within the projector
augmented wave method.11 A kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV
and a 555 k-point mesh in the Brillouin zone were
used. The convergence criterion of lattice parameter and
atomic position relaxation was set to 0.02 eV/Å. The result-
ant lattice constants a=6.79 Å, b=7.79 Å, and c=7.69 Å
and =117.7° are in good agreement with experiment and
previous theoretical values.12 The direct band gap at the 
point is severely underestimated by the GGA-PBE 5.53 eV
and the local density approximation LDA 5.26 eV com-
pared to a surface sensitive experimental value 7.4 eV.13 A
much more realistic gap of 7.41 eV is obtained with the
screened hybrid functional HSE06 Refs. 14 and 15 owing
to the alleviation of the self-interaction error and derivative
discontinuity problem by the nonlocal exact exchange. As
resolved from the projected density of states PDOS not
shown, the valence band maximum VBM is of O-2p char-
acter and the conduction band minimum consists of Mg-3s
and S-3s states. In particular, a pronounced broadening can
be seen in the water 1b1 orbital as a consequence of the
bonding to the neighboring Mg atoms.

149.150.51.237 On: Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:06:09adopted. Test calculations using larger unit cells conﬁrmed
that the 12 supercell is adequate for various adsorption
conﬁgurations while keeping the intermolecular interaction
minimized. By construction, the 100 surface is cleaved in a
way that the electrostatic dipoles between the Mg2+ and SO4
2−
are nearly within the surface plane. Hence, the macroscopic
dipole moment is negligible along the surface normal, mak-
ing this surface thermodynamically more favorable than
other surface planes. The nonpolar nature of the surface is
also evidenced by the small displacements of the surface
atoms during relaxations. For detailed description of the
100 surface the reader is referred to Ref. 13. A vacuum
thickness of 14 Å was used to separate the adsorbate system
from its periodic image. The calculations have been checked
to converge well with respect to the slab thickness, k-point
mesh 241, and kinetic energy cutoff 400 eV. For
geometrical relaxations, we employed the PBE-D scheme4,16
to take into account the long-range van der Waals vdW
force where it is important.7,17,18 In PBE-D, the dispersion
D is constructed by an empirical C6R−6 potential, which
allows for a transparent and fast assessment of the vdW in-
teractions in standard DFT approximations. The electronic
properties of the adsorbate system were then computed with
the HSE06 hybrid functional.
It is evident from the rotational ﬂexibility of the GA
molecule that the geometry optimizations of the adsorbate
system will lead to numerous stable or metastable conﬁgu-
rations and it is computationally prohibitive to locate all the
local minima. In the present study, we used a scanning
scheme in which the GA molecule was initially placed at
several different positions on the 12 surface supercell
with an orientation parallel to the surface plane. The whole
adsorbate system was then allowed to fully relax until the
equilibrium structure was reached, and the adsorption and
interaction energy can be calculated as
Eads = Esystem
relaxed −Esurface
relaxed −Emolecule
relaxed
1
and
Eint = Esystem
relaxed −Esurface

−Emolecule

,
2
where Erelaxed denotes the energy of the corresponding unit in
its equilibrium geometry and Eads is the energy of the unit in
the adsorbate geometry. The difference between Eads and Eint
is the deformation energy of the molecule and of the surface
upon interaction. Dissociative adsorption via deprotonation
has been found energetically unfavorable and is not included
in this study. We ﬁnd that the PBE-D method yields a nearly
identical adsorption geometry as the PBE except that the
dispersion force pulls the molecule 0.1 Å closer to the sur-
face. This suggests that the adsorption conﬁguration is
largely driven by short-range interactions. In Fig. 1, the two
conﬁgurations with the lowest Eads see Table I are pre-
sented, both of which depict the ﬁxture of the molecule via
multiple localized Mg–O and O–H bonds. Such bonding type
implies that an ordered structure can be achieved on
MgSO4·H2O100, where the GA molecule is prone to lie
ﬂat on the surface along the 010 direction. Speciﬁcally, in
conﬁguration I the molecule is stabilized via three Mg–O
bonds from the carboxylic and hydroxylic O atoms with
bond lengths ranging from 2.10 to 2.16 Å. The incorporated
water molecule at the surface is not interacting with the ad-
sorbate. In the second conﬁguration, we see a dominating
Mg–O bond from the hydroxylic O 2.06 Å, accompanied
by two weaker Mg–O bonds with larger bond lengths 2.22
and 2.55 Å. Besides, one of the hydroxylic O atoms binds to
the hydrogen of the water molecule at the surface Hw. The
difference in adsorption conﬁgurations has a direct inﬂuence
on the binding energy, as shown in Table I, where Eint cal-
culated with GGA-PBE is 0.33 eV higher for conﬁguration I.
While the vdW interaction Eint
PBE-D−Eint
PBE has been found
substantial for both conﬁgurations 0.84 and 0.95 eV, it ac-
counts for a relatively small portion 20%–25% of the total
Eint compared to the short-range molecule-surface interac-
tions. Hence, we conclude that the long-range vdW force
does not play a predominant role in the adsorption of GA on
MgSO4·H2O100.
Inspecting the charge density difference Fig. 1, one
ﬁnds electron accumulations in between the bond region
upon adsorption, as expected for covalent interactions. Note
that the electron redistribution at the molecule-surface inter-
face induces a change in the surface dipole by 2.3 D. The
covalent character is also seen in Fig. 2, where the molecular
orbitals of the adsorbate exhibit broadening and splitting due
to rehybridizations. This can be rationalized as a dative co-
valent bond through the donation from the lone-pair elec-
trons of the O atoms. However, the covalent bonds do not
contribute to the large interaction energy from the GGA-PBE
part. In contrast, they act as a repulsive Pauli barrier because
both the bonding and antibonding states are fully occupied.
Therefore, we ascribe the strong interaction energy to the
attractive electrostatic interaction arising from the Coulomb
terms. The covalent character, on the other hand, accounts
for the electronic structure of the adsorbate as we will show
in a moment. Furthermore, the charge transfer is found to be

149.150.51.237 On: Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:06:09small. For instance, a Bader analysis19 predicts that 0.01e are
transferred to the molecule for conﬁguration II. This is ex-
pected as the energy gaps of both the surface and molecule
are rather large.
An interesting indication of the large Ed in Table I is
the pronounced intramolecular distortion from its equilib-
rium geometry upon adsorption. This feature stems partially
from the intrinsic molecular structure of GA and is not ob-
served for some other organic molecules, e.g., hydroxyben-
zoic acid on MgSO4·H2O100.12 The sp3 hybridization in
the carbon chain makes the structure versatile through the
rotation along the C–C bond with a small energy barrier,
which can be easily overcome by the energy gain through the
subsequent GA-surface interactions. An immediate conse-
quence of this structural change can be manifested by the
reduced gap of the adsorbate with respect to that of the gas
phase molecule Table II. In addition, our calculation on
KCl001 shows a minor deformation of the GA molecule
with a much weaker Eads 0.4 eV excluding the vdW
force, an indication that the intramolecular distortion is also
related
to
the
surface.
The
higher
reactivity
of
MgSO4·H2O100 is associated with its lower Madelung po-
tential as the ions at the surface are more exposed to the
environment.
We now turn to the surface and adsorbate induced effect
on the molecular orbital of the GA molecule. It is surprising
to see from Fig. 2 that in conﬁguration II, the highest occu-
pied
molecular
orbital
HOMO
experiences
dramatic
changes upon adsorption, even with the intramolecular struc-
ture kept intact. A detailed analysis reveals that the order of
the HOMO and HOMO-1 is reversed after the molecule is
attached to the surface. Remembering that the HOMO and
HOMO-1 of GA in the gas phase are by no means degener-
ate, such reordering of the molecular orbitals is rather un-
usual on wide band gap insulators. This sends a signal that
the adsorption can strongly modify the molecular orbitals
even on pristine insulating surfaces. The interchange of
HOMO and HOMO-1 subsequently increases the energy gap
of the adsorbate by about 0.75 eV with respect to the isolated
molecule see Table II. We note that such gap variation
shows no dependence of the XC functional used. The drastic
modiﬁcation of the HOMO, however, is absent for conﬁgu-
ration I where the electron density redistribution is consider-
ably smaller. In Fig. 3 two distinct behaviors of the frontier
orbitals are perceivable when the GA molecule is lifted away
from the surface while the intramolecular structure is ﬁxed at
its adsorbate state. In conﬁguration I, the gap between the
HOMO
and
the
lowest
unoccupied
molecular
orbital
LUMO experiences a small decrease relative to the isolated
molecule. As the molecular HOMO in conﬁguration I lies
within the surface band gap, there is no coupling between the
HOMO and the surface valence band. Hence, the small gap
reduction arises from the electrostatic potential of surface
dipoles. This also holds true for the hydroxybenzoic acid
SA adsorbate on MgSO4·H2O100 as well as the GA on
alkali halide 001 surface. On the other hand, for conﬁgu-
ration II, the HOMO of the adsorbate is pinned below the
surface VBM as a result of the resonance between the hy-
droxylic oxygen and Hw of the surface. Since the hydrogen
bond weakens rapidly as the molecule is gradually detached
from the surface, one can see the accelerated upshift of the
HOMO against the VBM as well as the reduction in the
molecular energy gap in Fig. 3. It is thus clear that the strong
variations in the frontier orbitals upon molecular adsorption
stem from the rehybridizations. The water molecule, which

149.150.51.237 On: Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:06:09was usually thought to be inactive in MgSO4·H2O, however
plays an important role in the electronic properties of the
adsorbate.
We have seen up to this point that the frontier orbitals of
the adsorbate can be effectively inﬂuenced by the molecule-
surface interactions based on the interpretation from the
mean ﬁeld KS equation within the single particle Hamil-
tonian. Recently it has been found by photoemission20 and
electron transport measurements3,21that dynamic polarization
effect has a strong impact on the energy level position of the
frontier orbital. The polarization in the surface, which is in-
duced by the added electron hole in the afﬁnity ionization
level, acts back to the molecule and gives rise to a renormal-
ization of the molecular levels. Apparently such nonlocal
correlation is beyond the scope of KS-DFT and is not prop-
erly represented by KS eigenvalues, while it is accessible
from the self-energy 	=iGW within many-body corrections,
where G and W are Green’s function and the screened Cou-
lomb interaction, respectively.22–24 To illustrate to what ex-
tent the afﬁnity and ionization levels of the GA adsorbate are
shifted due to the polarization, G0W0 calculations8,25 on top
of LDA are performed for conﬁguration II. We note that the
polarization effect should be similar for conﬁguration I. The
G0W0 approach is a ﬁrst-order perturbation to the KS eigen-
values, and the quasiparticle QP correction to the energy
level can be written as the difference between the self-energy
and the XC potential VXC. We used QUANTUM-ESPRESSO
Ref. 26 for the LDA, followed by G0W0 calculations with
YAMBO.27 Norm-conserving pseudopotentials, a cutoff en-
ergy of 816 eV 60 Ry, and a 241 k-point mesh were
used. We included 200 and 400 empty bands for the isolated
GA and adsorbate system in the evaluation of self-energy 	,
respectively.28 For the dielectric matrix 3400 reciprocal lat-
tice vectors were used. The random phase approximation and
the plasmon-pole approximation with a plasmon frequency
of 27.2 eV were applied for the response function. The
slowly decaying Coulomb potential in the repeated-slab ap-
proach is corrected with a boxlike cutoff. The QP gap was
converged within 0.1 eV with these parameters.
The resulting QP gap from the G0W0
LDA for the gas phase
GA exhibits a much larger opening than the HSE06 HOMO-
LUMO gap see Table II. When the molecule is brought into
contact with the surface, a pronounced gap reduction 0.58
eV is obtained from the G0W0
LDA calculation. This is clearly
opposed to what has been found by DFT calculations. As the
charge transfer is very small, the gap reduction upon adsorp-
tion from the GW approximation arises from the surface po-
larization effect, which can be described by the classical im-
age charge theory.22,23,29 The afﬁnity ionization level of the
molecular adsorbate moves down up by the image charge

This

a gap reduction of 1.3 eV due to surface polarization. A
decomposition of the self-energy into the exchange and cor-
relation terms conﬁrms that the QP level shift upon adsorp-
tion mainly stems from the correlation part of the self-
energy. Note that apart from the polarization effect, the
change in the energy gap upon adsorption given by

that

with the HOMO-LUMO gap change upon adsorption from
the DFT calculations see Table II.
In summary, we have demonstrated that upon adsorption
to the surface of a wide band gap insulator, the molecular
orbitals of the adsorbate can experience substantial changes
as a result of the complex interplay of the sizable electro-
static interaction and rehybridization. Further, the polariza-
tion effect, as described by the GW approximation, yields a
prominent molecular energy gap reduction in the wide band
gap insulator. As the electronic properties are dictated by the
energetic positions and characteristics of frontier orbitals of
the adsorbate, one has to carefully assess the molecule-
insulator interface when interpreting the transport and spec-
troscopic measurements.
