We investigate theoretically and experimentally the static magnetic properties of single crystals of the
molecular-based single-chain magnet of formula Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh comprising alternating Dy3+ and
organic radicals. The magnetic molar susceptibility M displays a strong angular variation for sample rotations
around two directions perpendicular to the chain axis. A peculiar inversion between maxima and minima in the
angular dependence of M occurs on increasing temperature. Using information regarding the monomeric
building block as well as an ab initio estimation of the magnetic anisotropy of the Dy3+ ion, this “anisotropy-
inversion” phenomenon can be assigned to weak one-dimensional ferromagnetism along the chain axis. This
indicates that antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions between Dy3+ ions dominate, despite the
large Dy-Dy separation, over the nearest-neighbor interactions between the radicals and the Dy3+ ions. Mea-
surements of the ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization, both along and perpendicularly to the chain, and of the
angular dependence of M in a strong magnetic ﬁeld conﬁrm such an interpretation. Transfer-matrix simula-
tions of the experimental measurements are performed using a classical one-dimensional spin model with
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction and noncollinear uniaxial single-ion anisotropies favoring a
canted antiferromagnetic spin arrangement, with a net magnetic moment along the chain axis. The ﬁne agree-
ment obtained with experimental data provides estimates of the Hamiltonian parameters, essential for further
study of the dynamics of rare-earth-based molecular chains.

I. INTRODUCTION
For many years, one-dimensional 1D magnetic systems
have been intensively studied owing to their simplicity. A
number of sophisticated theoretical predictions have been ex-
perimentally veriﬁed as, for example: the existence of a spin
gap in the excitation spectrum of integer-spin Heisenberg
chains whereas half-integer spin chains have a gapless exci-
tation spectrum the so called Haldane conjecture1; the ex-
istence of a diffusive mode the so called Villain mode2 in
quasi-Ising S=1/2 antiferromagnetic spin chains; the contri-
bution of solitons to the thermodynamic properties of easy-
plane ferromagnetic3 and antiferromagnetic4 AF spin
chains, with an in-plane symmetry-breaking magnetic ﬁeld
or anisotropy. Quasi-1D compounds, obtained by the mo-
lecular synthetic approach,5,6 now allow the experimental in-
vestigation of dynamic phenomena that had been theoreti-
cally predicted some decades ago.7 Such systems have been
named single-chain magnets SCMs,8,9 by analogy with
single-molecule magnets SMMs,10 since they show mag-
netic hysteresis with no evidence of three-dimensional 3D
magnetic ordering but rather due to slow dynamics of the
magnetization of a pure 1D character. It was shown9,11 that
the relaxation toward thermodynamic equilibrium in these
systems is driven by thermally activated single-spin ﬂips,
described in ﬁrst approximation by the stochastic theory de-
veloped by Glauber7 for the ferromagnetic 1D Ising model.
The effect of introducing nonmagnetic impurities in the
chain was investigated12–14 too. The ﬁrst system showing
SCM behavior was the quasi-1D molecular compound of
formula Cohfac2NITPhOMe, where hfac is hexaﬂuoro-
acetylacetonate and NITPhOMe is the nitronyl-nitroxide
radical
2-PhOMe-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-
imidazolyl-1-oxil-3-oxide.15 The repeating unit of such mo-
lecular chains is formed by two different magnetic centers, a
MIIhfac2 moiety containing a metal in the present case
CoII, and a radical moiety that bridges the metals. The prop-
erties of this class of magnetic polymers can then be tuned,
with different effects, by rationally changing either the metal
or the radical moieties. In the rich ﬁeld that has stemmed
from this ﬁrst observation, several other compounds present-
ing SCM behavior have been synthesized,16–24 and evidences
of quantum effects affecting the magnetization dynamics at
low
temperatures
have
also
been
reported.25 A one-
dimensional hysteretic behavior of the magnetization was
identiﬁed also in different non-molecular structures, such as
atomic Co nanowires of ﬁnite length, decorating the steps of
vicinal Pt997 surfaces.26
To observe Glauber dynamics two requirements are usu-
ally necessary: i a strong Ising-like anisotropy and ii a
very low ratio of interchain/intrachain magnetic exchange
interactions, in order for slow dynamics to be observed
above the transition temperature to 3D magnetic ordering. In
the framework of molecular engineering, quasi-1D chains in
which the metal center is a rare-earth RE ion are very ap-
pealing candidates to observe a large variety of phenomena,

are

different
magnetic
anisotropies.27 One limiting case is constituted by molecular-
based quasi-1D compounds of formula Gdhfac3NITR
where
NITR
is
2-R-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-
imidazolyl-1-oxil-3-oxide, and R is ethyl Et, isopropyl
iPr, methyl Me, or phenyl Ph, where the GdIII ions
are magnetically isotropic. In these systems helimagnetic be-
havior could be evidenced due to competing magnetic inter-
actions between nearest-neighboring NN and next-nearest-
neighboring
NNN
spin
sites.
When
R=Et,
Villain’s
conjecture28 of a two-step magnetic ordering to a low-
temperature helical 3D phase, through an intermediate chiral
spin liquid 3D phase, was conﬁrmed the two transitions oc-
curring at 1.88 K and 2.19 K, respectively.29 When passing
from isotropic Gd to Dy, which presents a strong Ising-like
anisotropy, a transition to 3D magnetic order occurring at 4.4
K can be observed in Dyhfac3NITEt.30,31 However, us-
ing a bulkier NITC6H4OPh radical32 increases the distance
between chains so that SCM behavior is observed with no
evidence of any 3D magnetic order down to the lowest in-
vestigated temperature 1.7 K. The two requirements i and
ii, necessary to observe Glauber dynamics, are thus fulﬁlled
in Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh. Consistently, the relaxation
time  was found32 to follow an Arrhenius law =0e/kBT. In
order to fully understand the rich dynamics of these quasi-1D
systems,32,33 in particular the role played by NNN interac-
tions, a modelization of the static properties is necessary. In
this paper, an accurate experimental study of the angular de-
pendence
of
the
single-crystal
magnetization
of
Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh, combined with ab initio esti-
mation of the magnetic anisotropy of the Dy3+ ions, is pre-
sented. The static magnetic properties of the chain system are
simulated by means of a classical transfer-matrix calculation,
formulated for a 1D Heisenberg model with antiferromag-
netic exchange coupling and noncollinear local anisotropy
axes. Fine agreement with experimental data as a function of
crystal orientation, temperature, and magnetic ﬁeld is ob-
tained and the Hamiltonian parameters can then be esti-
mated. The dominant role of NNN magnetic interactions of
these molecular structures, despite the large Dy-Dy separa-
tion, is clearly demonstrated. These ﬁndings are expected to
be extremely important to target novel SCM dynamics in
molecular compounds, and to rationalize the SCM behavior
of Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh and the related class of
compounds.33 In particular, as the role of natural and induced
defects is substantially different when competing NN and
NNN interactions are present, this situation can lead to the
observation of different dynamic regimes in addition to the
already known ones see Fig. 1a for a schematic represen-
tation of the NN and NNN magnetic interactions.
II. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AND AB INITIO
CALCULATIONS
Recently we investigated in detail a monomeric com-
pound of formula Dyhfac3NITR2 where the metal ion is
coordinated to the oxygen atoms of two different radicals,34
like in the chain. In fact, we suggest that the monomer can be
considered as a building block of the chain. Using angle-
resolved
magnetometry,
the
molecular
magnetic-
susceptibility tensor of the monomeric derivative has been
reconstructed, revealing an exceptionally large Ising-type
magnetic anisotropy of the Dy3+ ion.34 This technique also
provides the orientation of the principal magnetic axes of the
monomer; the Ising axis turns out to lie in between the two
radicals, almost along the binary axis of the approximate c2
symmetry of the molecule. Moreover, the experimental ﬁnd-
ings nicely agree with ab initio calculations within ca. 7°
deviation between the experimental and theoretical direc-
tions of the magnetization easy axis.
Here, we apply the same quantum chemistry method
CASSCF/RASSI-SO,35 using the MOLCAS-7.0 package,36 in
order to obtain the single-ion easy-anisotropy axes of the
Dy3+ ions in the Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh chain com-
pound. In this multiconﬁgurational approach relativistic ef-
fects are treated in two steps, both based on the Douglas-
Kroll Hamiltonian.37 Scalar terms are included in the basis
set generation and are used to determine spin-free wave
functions and energies, through the use of complete active
space self-consistent ﬁeld CASSCF method. Then, spin-
orbit SO coupling is treated with a restricted active space
state interaction computation RASSI-SO, which uses the
CASSCF wave functions as the basis states. By using the
resulting eigenstates of the previous method, the gyromag-
netic tensor of the ground doublet Kramer’s state can be
computed and diagonalized in order to obtain the three main
anisotropy axes and the gyromagnetic values along those
axes gx, gy, and gz.
Computations are performed in a quantum cluster model
considering a Dy3+ ion and its surrounding ligand molecules,
i.e., three hfac and two NIT radicals, using the geometry
determined by the x-ray structure analysis. In this cluster
model several modiﬁcations have been introduced in order to
reduce the large computational time: the ﬂuorides in the hfac

134419-2ligands have been replaced by H atoms, the NITC6H4OPh
radicals have been replaced by NITC6H5, and H atoms
have been added to the external oxygen atoms of the radicals
transforming them in close-shell molecules, and therefore re-
ducing the active space of the CASSCF calculations. Despite
the previous modelization, the quantum cluster would still
require a large computational time due to its size. Therefore
a Cholesky decomposition technique,38 recently imple-
mented in the MOLCAS package, is used to overcome prob-
lems arising from the large size of the two-electron integral
matrix.
All the atoms were represented by basis sets of atomic
natural orbitals from the ANO-RCC library, as implemented
in the MOLCAS-7.0 quantum chemistry package, and the fol-
lowing contractions were used: 8s7p4d3f2g for Dy, 3s2p
for O, C, and N, and 2s for H. The CASSCF active space
consisted on the Dy 4f orbitals, containing nine electrons in
seven orbitals. The previous ab initio computation in the
monomeric compound showed a minor role of the quadru-
plets and the doublets CASSCF states in the spin-orbit cou-
pling effect on the energy levels of the 6H15/2 ground multi-
plet. Therefore, only the three sextets, 6H, 6F, and 6P, have
been computed in three different CASSCF state average cal-
culations, one for each of the sextets. The 21 resulting
CASSCF states were introduced in a RASSI-SO state inter-
action in order to compute the effect of the spin-orbit cou-
pling. The computed energies of the 6H15/2 multiplet are
listed in Table I.
The gyromagnetic factors for the ground doublet have
also been evaluated and found to be gx=0.3, gy=0.7, and
gz=18.7. The computed single-ion anisotropy axis almost co-
incides with a binary axis in the idealized symmetry of the
DyO8 polyhedron, similarly to what observed for the mono-
mer. The easy axis forms an angle  of ca. 80° with respect
to the b crystallographic axis along the chain axis, whereas
the projection of the single-ion anisotropy axis in the ac
plane perpendicular to the chain axis forms an angle  of
ca. 50° with the a axis. Compared to the triclinic monomer,
here the situation is complicated by the fact that the chain
crystallizes in the P212121 space group N°19, Z=4, with
three twofold screw axes as symmetry elements. The asym-
metric unit contains one Dy3+ ion, and consequently all dys-
prosium atoms are symmetry related. When superimposing
the Ising axis of the Dy3+ ion on the chain, its symmetry
elements generate a canted structure as depicted in Fig. 1a.
In Fig. 1b, a view along the chain direction the crystallo-
graphic b axis of the crystal packing of the chains is re-
ported. As a consequence of this crystal packing, even if the
chains are structurally all equivalent, they are differently ori-
ented from the magnetic point of view. Two types of chains
A and B are related by a 21 twofold screw axis in the ac
plane, while each of these chains is generated by its own 21
axis along b. When analyzing the magnetic behavior of the
chain, we thus have to consider not only the canted structure
generated by the alternate inclination of the Ising axes with
respect to the chain direction, b, but also the two families of
chains A and B, whose projections on the ac plane of the
easy axis of the Dy3+ ions form an angle of ca. 80°.
III. MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS
Single-crystal magnetic measurements were performed
using a homemade horizontal rotator that allows, after orien-
tation of the crystal, to measure the magnetic susceptibility
along and perpendicularly to the chain axis. The morphology
of the crystals, with large 101 and 1¯01¯ faces, does not
allow performing rotations along the principal crystallo-
graphic axes. We thus deﬁne a laboratory frame, X,Y ,Z,
with Z corresponding to the normal to the 101 crystal face,
Y =b, and X orthogonal to the ﬁrst two. The new reference
frame is thus obtained performing a rotation of the crystal-
lographic frame, abc, around b the chain axis, by an
angle 49.8° see Fig. 1b.
In Fig. 2 we show the angular dependence of the ratio
M/H between magnetization and ﬁeld, henceforth indicated
as the molar susceptibility M, in three orthogonal rotations
performed at 2.8 K in an external ﬁeld of 1 kOe. As expected
for an orthorhombic system, the crystallographic axes corre-
spond to relative extrema. Two out of three rotations are
almost identical, and display a strong angular dependence of
M, which has its maximum along the chain direction. The
third rotation, the one around b, shows a very low angle-
independent value of M.

SPIN CANTING IN A Dy-BASED SINGLE-CHAIN…
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 79, 134419 2009
134419-3The
temperature-dependent
magnetic
behavior
of
Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh was also investigated. Measure-
ments were performed in the 2.4–51 K temperature range,
both for the angular variation in M Fig. 3 and for the ﬁeld
H dependence of the magnetization M Fig. 4. If we con-
sider the rotation around X reported in Fig. 3 top for tem-
peratures between 2.4 and 6.5 K, the maximum of M is
found at 90°, thus along the chain, and the minima at 0° and
180°, i.e., perpendicularly to the chain. At 8 K, the M curve
has almost no angular dependence. For temperatures from
9.5 to 51 K, the maxima and minima are inverted with re-
spect to the low-temperature curves. This is a quite spectacu-
lar and peculiar feature which, at ﬁrst glance, seems trou-
bling. However, previous investigations34,39 give us some
hints to rationalize this result:
i The direction of the Ising anisotropy of the Dy3+ ion in
the monomer34 is temperature independent in the tempera-
ture range investigated here, thus the anisotropy crossover
observed around 8 K cannot be attributed solely to an elec-
tronic effect of the Dy3+ ions in the chain compound.
ii The projection of the Ising axes gathered from ab
initio calculations and the analysis of the monomeric build-
ing block34 of the chain structure suggests that the easy axes
are not collinear.
iii The observed behavior i.e., the anisotropy inversion
recalls the one encountered in MnTPPO2PPh·H2O
where
TPP=meso-tetraphenylporphyrin,
a
MnIII-based
canted antiferromagnetic SCM.39
It is interesting to note that similar inversions at two
different temperatures were observed40 in the magnetic
torque curves of TPPFePcCN22, a molecular conductor
that can be described by a one-dimensional anisotropic
Heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange interac-
tions.
A scenario of a canted AF 1D structure similar to the one
observed in the MnTPPO2PPh·H2O chain39 requires that,
in the alternating Dy-radical chain under study, the NNN AF
interactions dominate the NN ones see Fig. 1a for a sche-
matic representation of the NN and NNN magnetic interac-
tions. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, the ﬁeld dependence of
the magnetization was measured. In Fig. 4 top we report
the M vs H curves recorded along and perpendicularly to the
chain. A very different shape of the curve is observed de-
pending on whether the ﬁeld is aligned along the noncom-
pensated moment i.e., along the chain, thus giving a rapid
saturation of the magnetization, or closer to the compensated
easy axes i.e., perpendicularly to the chain, providing a sort
of metamagnetic transition when the magnetic ﬁeld over-
whelms the antiferromagnetic interaction see Sec. IV for
quantitative details.

134419-4The rapid saturation of the component along the chain
observed at 3 K, with a plateau corresponding to ca
10 000 emu mol−11.8B, is the typical behavior ex-
pected for a weak ferromagnet WF—indeed in this case a
1D WF—along the direction of the noncompensated mo-
ments. Perpendicularly to the chain, and more precisely
along the Z axis, the magnetization is almost linear at low
ﬁeld, but shows a rapid increase around 15 kOe and satura-
tion at larger ﬁelds, almost 22 000 emu mol−14.1B.
Interestingly, the step in the magnetization perpendicular
to the chain becomes smoother when temperature is in-
creased, and ﬁnally disappears for temperatures above 10 K,
when the weak AF interaction becomes negligible and the
anisotropy of the sample is driven by the single-ion aniso-
tropy of the Dy3+. When the ﬁeld is applied along the chain
direction, i.e., the direction of the noncompensated moment,
a more regular behavior is observed, as the initial suscepti-
bility monotonously decreases with increasing temperatures.
This feature sheds some light on the quite unique behav-
ior of the whole family of lanthanide-based SCMs.32,33 Mag-
netization curves recorded on the 4f-based SCM family al-
ways display steps at relatively high ﬁeld, and a trend was
observed along the lanthanide series.32,33 In fact, the position
of the step is explained by the simultaneous presence of an
anisotropic center providing the anisotropic canted struc-
ture and of an AF interaction along the chain. Hence, the
stronger is the intrachain magnetic interaction, the higher is
the ﬁeld needed to compensate this interaction, shifting the
step toward higher ﬁelds.
This
allows
concluding
that,
in
the
Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh SCM under study:
i Antiferromagnetic interaction between Dy3+ ions is
present. Due to this fact, the magnetization components per-
pendicular to the chain direction cancel out at low tempera-
ture and low ﬁeld, while they become favored at higher tem-
peratures.
ii The high-temperature hard axis becomes the easy axis
at low temperature because noncompensation of the canted
spins occurs.
iii The anisotropy inversion is visible around 9 K, sug-
gesting a relatively weak intrachain exchange interactions, as
expected in compounds involving tripositive lanthanides.
If we now compare the observed magnetization values for
the chain and the monomer derivative, a ﬁrst saturation
Msat58 000 emu mol−111B has been observed along
the easy axis of the monomer.34 At a ﬁrst level of approxi-
mation we can neglect the radical contribution, which is
much smaller than that given by the paramagnetic ions;
moreover, the “radical” sublattice is on itself experiencing
AF interactions mediated by the lanthanide ion and is also
frustrated due to the sizeable AF NNN interaction between
Dy3+ spins see Sec. IV.34 This allows providing a rough
estimation of the angle, , formed by the easy axis of each
Dy3+ center with the chain axis, b. In fact, comparing the
aforementioned saturation value 58 000 emu mol−1 with
the rapid saturation one 8000 emu mol−1 reached when
the
ﬁeld
is
applied
along
the
chain,
yields

=cos−18000/5800082°. This value is consistent with the
results of the ab initio calculations.
As for the magnetization curve measured perpendicularly
to the chain, the ﬁeld was applied aligned along Z. Consid-
ering the direction of the local easy axes predicted by the ab
initio calculations see Fig. 1b, the applied ﬁeld is almost
parallel to the projection of these axes on the ac plane for
type B chains, whereas it is almost perpendicular to type A
chains. For the two symmetry-related families of chains, A
and B, the projections of the local easy axes on the ac plane
are almost reciprocally perpendicular but, remarkably, this is
a fully accidental coincidence rather than a symmetry-
imposed result. Therefore, as schematically represented in
Fig. 5, the applied ﬁeld can compete with the AF interaction
inside the chain of type B whereas it has no effect on the
other family A, where Dy3+ spins remain antiferromagneti-
cally coupled. Thus, only one chain type is contributing to
the magnetization, which should approach a value M
= 1
258 000 sin  that is, M28 700 emu mol−1, not very
far from the experimental value. Despite the fact that these
ﬁgures can be only taken as indicative, given the rough ap-
proximation of neglecting the radical contribution, such satu-
ration values for the magnetization are in agreement with our
prediction about the orientation of the local easy axes, based
on the ab initio calculations.
A further conﬁrmation of the correctness of this hypoth-
esis can be afforded by performing, at low temperature, a
rotation around b the chain axis under an external ﬁeld of
30 kOe: i.e., a ﬁeld strong enough to be capable of distin-
guishing the different projections of the Ising axes in the ac
plane by overcoming the AF interaction. From Fig. 6 top
one can clearly see that contrarily to what observed at low
ﬁeld, M is now angle dependent, with a very peculiar be-
havior with large maxima and a roughly 90° periodicity. It
should be noticed that:
i The absolute maxima are observed along the crystallo-
graphic axes a and c, and not along the directions where the
projections of the local axes fall.
ii The data show a secondary periodical structure of
smaller maxima shifted by an angle of ca. 45°.
As a ﬁnal remark, we notice that the maxima observed in
Fig. 6 top along a and c are not strictly equivalent, but the
direction c appears to be favored. In Sec. IV we will show
that this feature can be interpreted as due to a slight but
appreciable departure from orthogonality of the projection
on the ac plane of the local easy axis of Dy3+ ions belonging
to the two symmetry-related chain families, A and B, as in-
deed predicted by ab initio calculations.
We have also checked the temperature dependence of the
anisotropy when rotating at high ﬁeld around the chain axis,

134419-5b see Fig. 7, top. The results show that the behavior is
strongly temperature dependent. Since in this temperature
range the Dy3+ anisotropy of the monomeric constituent units
of the chain does not change, these data conﬁrm the key role
played by the exchange interaction, suggesting an order of
magnitude of the AF interaction of a few Kelvins see Sec.
IV for a more detailed discussion.
IV. THEORY AND DISCUSSION
In order to interpret the measurements of the static mag-
netic properties of the chain, we model both A and B chains
with a classical-spin Hamiltonian
H = −
I JSI · SI + 1 + DSzII2 + 0
,	
Hg	S	I,
1
where 0 is the Bohr magneton and ,	=X,Y ,Z denote
Cartesian components in the crystallographic frame a, b,
and c, while the subscript zI denotes the spin component
along a local anisotropy axis, varying with lattice site I. In
the sum, only the Dy centers are considered for the reasons
given below. The AF exchange interaction J
0 is consid-
ered isotropic, while the anisotropy is introduced through a
single-ion term D0 favoring local zI axes, which are
different for even and odd sites, and in the Landé tensor
g	. In a local reference frame, the Landé tensor is as-
sumed to have only diagonal components, g	 and g where
parallel and perpendicular refer to the local axis zI. Since
spin Hamiltonian 1 is classical, the spin modulus S does not
matter its effect can be taken into account by the parameters
J, D, and g’s. For an easy comparison with the calculation
performed for the monomer,34 we will assume S=1/2. No-
tice that the classical nature of the spins allows the inclusion
of single-ion anisotropy even in this case.34 Concerning the

134419-6neglect of the radicals, we note that their anisotropy is very
low compared to the Dy3+ one, and the Dy-radical interaction
is necessarily frustrated since the interaction between the
Dy3+ ions is antiferromagnetic. As a ﬁrst approximation, the
system can thus be considered as the superposition of two
independent one-dimensional magnetic lattices, one formed
by the Dy3+ ions with magnetic anisotropy and the other by
the radicals magnetically isotropic. At low temperatures,
the contribution of the “radical” lattice is expected to be very
small because of the relatively strong NNN antiferromag-
netic interaction between radicals.34
Using a transfer-matrix method,41 the static magnetic
properties of 1D classical-spin model 1 can be exactly ex-
pressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real
positive-deﬁnite matrix see the Appendix for details. In this
way, starting from certain values of the Hamiltonian param-
eters, we were able to numerically simulate the static mag-
netic behavior of the real chain compound. The simulation
procedure started from placing the local easy axes at 
=75° from the b axis and its projection on the ac plane at
= 45° from a. The other Hamiltonian parameters used for
the simulation were J=−24 K, D=160 K, g	=21, and g
=4, where parallel and perpendicular refer to the local zI
axis. The contributions from the two families of chains were
then summed up. In Fig. 3 bottom we report a simulation of
the quantity M/H, calculated for different temperatures when
rotating along X, to be compared with the measured dc sus-
ceptibility in Fig. 3 top. The susceptibility presents a maxi-
mum along b and a minimum along Z for T
8 K, while the
trend is reversed for T8 K. Thus, the anisotropy inversion
observed at T=8.5 K on the experimental data in Fig. 3 top
is nicely reproduced.
The ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization at selected
temperatures, both for H parallel and perpendicular to the
chain, was simulated using the same Hamiltonian param-
eters: see Fig. 4 bottom. The measured overall behavior of
Fig. 4 top was reproduced, although a more quantitative
comparison was prevented by the neglect of the radical con-
tribution in adopted model 1.
In particular, a relationship between the ﬁeld at which a
rapid increase in the magnetization perpendicular to the
chain is observed and the transfer-matrix-computation pa-
rameters can be deduced by simple arguments. Without loss
of generality, we assume that spins are essentially con-
strained to be oriented along their local anisotropy axes at
low temperatures and consider an applied ﬁeld lying on the
ac plane at = +45° from a. This implies that the Zeeman
energy of half of the spins is frustrated the SII-spin sublat-
tice with the notation of the Appendix. The ﬂip of such spins
lowers the Zeeman energy per spin by a factor EZeeman
=2Sg	BH sin . On the other hand, the corresponding in-
crease
in
the
exchange
energy
per
spin
is
Eexch

. The reversal of such a sublattice is expected
to occur when these two energies are equal, i.e., at the ﬁeld
Hflip= 2S
J cos2
g	B sin  =15.25 kOe. These naïve energy consider-
ations give the correct value for the “jump” ﬁeld see Fig. 4
bottom, the effect of temperature being solely that of
rounding the step in the magnetization curve.
Under quite general conditions,42 the correlation length 
of anisotropic classical-spin chains behaves asymptotically at
low
temperatures
as
exp
Eexch
2kBT .
Consequently,
for
T
Eexch
2kB , both families of spin chains are expected to lose
their genuine 1D character and respond to a ﬁeld as indepen-
dent anisotropic paramagnetic centers. Again, the order of
magnitude of
Eexch
2kB =10.4 K matches with the temperature at
which the anisotropy inversion was observed.
The rotation around the chain axis, b, of the molar sus-
ceptibility was also simulated in a strong external ﬁeld H
=30 kOe, and the contributions from each family of chains
A and B are reported in Fig. 6 center, along with their
sum. A qualitative explanation of the observed behavior can
be obtained by looking in detail at the effect of the ﬁeld
when it is applied at different angles in the ac plane: see Fig.
6 bottom. When the ﬁeld is along a or c, it lies at nearly
45° from the easy axis of both families of chains. Even if a
smaller component of the ﬁeld indeed proportional to
cos 45° acts on the magnetic moments, this is still enough to
overcome the AF interaction. This is for example represented
by the arrows at Angle=45° in Fig. 6 bottom. Given the
large anisotropy of Dy3+ in this environment, the magnetic
moments remain aligned along their easy axis, and only the
weak intrachain AF interaction is overcome. The largest
magnetization value we can measure is therefore reduced to
Msat sin 75° cos 45° 39 600 emu mol−1, not too far from
the observed value 37 500 emu mol−1. It is evident that
each chain type gives a contribution with a periodicity of
180° so that, owing to the accidental orthogonality between
the two families A and B, the overall periodicity is 90°.
Finally, in order to simulate the asymmetry in the height
of the major peaks displayed in Fig. 6 top, the hypothesis
of a perfect orthogonality between the projections of the two
chain types, A and B, was released. In Fig. 7 bottom the
angular variation in M at selected temperatures, calculated
assuming an angle  between a and the projection of the
local easy axes in the ac plane for the A-type chain slightly
larger than 45°, is reported. The ﬁne agreement with experi-
mental data see Fig. 7, top proves that the different height
of the major peaks at 45° and 135° can be attributed to
nonperfect
orthogonality.
Interestingly,
even
the
minor
maxima between two main maxima are reproduced at sufﬁ-
ciently low temperatures.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we have performed a thorough experimen-
tal and theoretical investigation to rationalize the complex
magnetic
behavior
of
the
Dy-based
SCM
Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh. By means of angle-resolved
magnetometry the magnetic anisotropy of this complex sys-
tem has been accurately determined and it has been possible
to evidence a peculiar “anisotropy-inversion” phenomenon,
in which the easy and hard axes of the magnetization of the
system swap when rising the temperature. These features
could be fully explained, with excellent agreement between
theory and experiments, using a combined theoretical ap-
proach in which the single RE-ion anisotropy is described at
the quantum-chemical level while the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the whole system of coupled ions are computed with

134419-7a classical-spin Hamiltonian. This combined theoretical strat-
egy is mandatory to tackle the complexity of anisotropic
magnetic molecular materials, often characterized by a low-
symmetry environment of the magnetic centers. The rich
magnetic behavior of Dyhfac3NITC6H4OPh was well
reproduced by the model calculations that highlighted the
presence of two sets of noninteracting parallel chains, with
their projections mutually tilted by about 90°. Accordingly,
the metamagnetic transition inside each symmetry-related
family of chains could be addressed independently. The com-
bined approach has also allowed quantifying the sign, mag-
nitude and role of NNN interactions between Dy3+ ions. De-
spite the large distances between the REs 8 Å, the
overall behavior is actually dominated by this antiferromag-
netic NNN exchange pathway, which gives rise to the very
rich magnetic behavior observed. The same evidence was
previously reported for isotropic Gd ions. The present ﬁnd-
ing shows that NNN are more common than believed so far
and may induce a critical revision of the description of the
magnetic properties of polynuclear compounds. The present
study may thus represent a methodological guide line to ra-
tionalize the magnetic properties of RE-based SCMs as well
as other extremely complex behaviors displayed by molecu-
lar materials in general. To the aim of understanding the
dynamic behavior of RE-based SCMs, the obtained informa-
tion represents a fundamental preliminary step; from the
knowledge that competing NN and NNN interactions are
present, for instance, one can reasonably expect the observa-
tion of particular dynamic regimes. For instance, we expect
the effect of natural and induced defects to be substantially
different than the already known cases in which only NN
interactions are present.12–14 As an example, preliminary re-
sults indicate that, while the contribution of the radicals to
the static properties is almost negligible, they actively con-
tribute to the correlation length even when the Dy3+ ions are
partially substituted by diamagnetic ions. In this sense, by
doping with diamagnetic ions the controlled interaction be-
tween segments of chains can be tuned, thus allowing a fur-
ther form of engineering of the dynamic properties.

APPENDIX: TRANSFER-MATRIX METHOD
In this appendix, we brieﬂy describe the transfer-matrix
method, which allows the determination, at any nonzero tem-
perature, of the static properties of a one-dimensional model
of classical spins in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunc-
tions of a real positive-deﬁnite matrix. Here the method will
be applied in the thermodynamic limit, but it can be refor-
mulated also to treat the case of a ﬁnite system with open or
periodic boundary conditions.
It is worth noticing that the method is exact: the only
approximation is that the spins are considered as classical
vectors. Since the method requires an integration over the
unit sphere surface to be discretized, numerical errors are
signiﬁcant only at very low temperatures, where the inte-
grand presents strong variations over the integration domain.
However, the accuracy of the method can be improved at
will by using a greater number of integration points.
Following Pandit and Tannous,41 we consider a single
magnetic chain with two sublattices, I and II not to be con-
fused with the two families of chains related by “accidental”
orthogonality, A and B.
To ﬁx ideas, let us consider a single A-type chain: in the
lth unit cell, there are two spins, SIl and SIIl, character-
ized by two different local axes, zI and zII, forming equal
angles I=II=75°, see Fig. 8 with the chain axis b and
their projections in the ac plane differing by 180° I
=45° , II=225° with the a axis.
The Hamiltonian of the chain can be rewritten, as in Ref.

43Quite similarly, for a single B-type chain, in the lth unit cell,
there are two spins, SIl and SIIl, characterized by two differ-
ent local axes, zI and zII, forming equal angles I=II=75°
with the chain axis b, and angles differing by 180° with the a
axis within the ac plane. In this case, one has I=−45°, II
=135°.
