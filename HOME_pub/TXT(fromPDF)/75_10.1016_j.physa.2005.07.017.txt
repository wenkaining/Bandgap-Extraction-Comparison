Abstract
In this work, we address modal parameter ﬂuctuations in statistical distributions describing
charge-to-breakdown ðQBDÞ and/or time-to-breakdown ðtBDÞ during the dielectric breakdown
regime of ultra-thin oxides, which are of high interest for the advancement of electronic
technology. We reobtain a generalized Weibull distribution (q-Weibull), which properly
describes ðtBDÞ data when oxide thickness ﬂuctuations are present, in order to improve
reliability assessment of ultra-thin oxides by time-to-breakdown ðtBDÞ extrapolation and area
scaling. The incorporation of ﬂuctuations allows a physical interpretation of the q-Weibull
distribution in connection with the Tsallis statistics. In support to our results, we analyze tBD
data of SiO2-based MOS devices obtained experimentally and theoretically through a
percolation model, demonstrating an advantageous description of the dielectric breakdown by
the q-Weibull distribution.

The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors indicates the need to
decrease the SiO2 gate thickness to less than 3nm to pursue the continuity of the Moore’s
Law [1]. Research efforts to maintain this trend have been focusing on: (i) the advan-
tageous substitution of SiO2 by high dielectric constant materials to allow equivalent gate
dielectric oxide thickness bellow 1nm [2]; (ii) a better understanding of the fractal regime
of ultra-thin gate dielectric oxide growth, where spatial inhomogeneities or ﬂuctuations
are important [3,4] considerations for the control of dielectric breakdown conditions.
Consequently, the reliability of ultra-thin oxides for ultra-large scale integration is one of
the most important concerns in the domain of electronics miniaturization nowadays [5–7].
Two quantities which are experimentally measured to assess the reliability of a
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device are: the charge-to-breakdown QBD, deﬁned
as the time-integrated current density which ﬂows until breakdown occurs, and the
time-to-breakdown tBD, deﬁned as the samples’ lifetime. These quantities are
statistically distributed and are usually assumed to be Weibull distributed [8]. In
particular, accurate assessment of reliability of ultra-thin oxides is seriously affected
by ﬂuctuations of oxide thickness. These ﬂuctuations cause a deviation from the
Weibull distribution, which is easily observed by a curvature in a graph of ln½ ln½1 
FðtÞ versus ln½t, being FðtÞ ¼
R t
0 PðxÞ dx the cumulative distribution. Extrapolation
of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles to lower failure percentiles can
lead to serious errors in reliability assessment, as shown by Wu et al. [5].
Deviations from a given distribution can be generated by taking scale mixtures of it
[9]. For instance, the scale parameter of the exponential and Gaussian distributions
can be averaged by a gamma distribution. In these two cases, the deviation induced
by the ﬂuctuation in this parameter has been successfully employed in the description
of physical situations, such as those related with nonexponential decay [10,11] and
turbulence [12,13]. Furthermore, this average process has also been connected with
the entropic parameter q in the context of Tsallis statistics [10–12]. By taking the
ﬂuctuations of the modal parameter of the Weibull distribution into account, we
obtain a generalized Weibull distribution which properly describes tBD data when
oxide ﬂuctuations are present, thus improving reliability assessment of ultra-thin
oxides by tBD extrapolation and area scaling. This generalized Weibull distribution,
without focusing ﬂuctuations, was discussed and applied in Ref. [14] to other systems.
In the following section we present the generalized Weibull distribution employed
here. The application of this distribution to the description of the dielectric breakdown
in oxides is considered in Section 3. The last section is dedicated to our conclusions.
2. q-Weibull distribution
The Weibull distribution often used in the statistical description in the study of the
time-to-breakdown in electronic devices [15] is given by

210where the parameter x0 is the modal value that corresponds to 63; 2% of the samples’
lifetime. The parameter b is the Weibull slope and deﬁnes the time-to-breakdown
spreading degree. In order to incorporate the referred ﬂuctuation, we consider a
Weibull compound distribution pðx; yÞ ¼ byxb1 expðyxbÞ. Here, y ¼ xb
0 , with b
ﬁxed and x0 changing so that the new parameter y is a stochastic variable ruled by
the gamma probability density function
pðyÞ ¼ dryr1edy
GðrÞ

Therefore, the average in the stochastic parameter y,

leads to [16]
hpðx; yÞiy ¼ rdrbxb1ðxb þ dÞðrþ1Þ .

Note that by naming this average Pq0ðxÞ, it can be written as

where we used the q-exponential function deﬁned as expq0ða xÞ  ½1  ð1  q0Þ
a x1=ð1q0Þ if 1  ð1  q0Þ a xX0, and expq0ða xÞ  0 if 1  ð1  q0Þ a xo0, with q0 ¼
ð2 þ rÞ=ð1 þ rÞ and ~xb
0 ¼ ½d=ðr þ 1Þ.
By comparing Eq. (1) with Eq. (5) we verify that Pq0ðxÞ is a generalization of the
Weibull distribution in the same sense that the q-exponential function generalizes the
exponential one. In view of this observation and following Ref. [14], we refer to
Pq0ðxÞ as q-Weibull distribution. We also remark that Pq0ðxÞ contains a broad class of
distributions as particular cases. In fact, in the limit q0 ! 1 it reduces to the Weibull
distribution, for b ! 1 it gives the q-exponential distribution, and when q0 ! 1 and
b ! 1 it becomes the exponential distribution. Furthermore, from Eq. (4) we verify
two power law regimes, one for small x, xb1, and another for large x, xð1þrbÞ.
Notice also that
R 1
0 Pq0ðxÞ dx exists and is equal to one when q0o2.
Before addressing our discussion to the application of the q-Weibull distribution
concerning experimental and simulation results, we give a connection of this
distribution with the Tsallis statistics. The ﬁrst step towards verifying this connection
is based on the fact that the q-exponential can be viewed as a signature of the Tsallis
statistics, since it basically replaces the exponential in the canonical distribution. In
fact, this canonical distribution is obtained when the Tsallis entropy Sq  ð1 
PW
i¼1 pq
i Þ=ð1  qÞ is maximized subjected to appropriate constraints [17]. Here, pi is
the probability of the ith state, W is the number of accessible states, and q is a real
parameter that rules the degree of generalization of the theory (when q ! 1 we
recover the usual entropy). On the other hand, the q-exponential function can be
obtained from the average of the exponential function by using the gamma
distribution, Eq. (2) [18]. Thus, the parameter q occurring in the Tsallis statistics is
ARTICLE IN PRESS

211shown to be entirely induced by the ﬂuctuations of the parameter of the usual
exponential distribution [10]. Following this interpretation, the average process
employed to obtain Pq0ðxÞ characterizes an implicit connection with the Tsallis
statistics.
3. Application to dielectric breakdown
To apply our distribution, Eq. (5), to investigate experimental and numerical
simulated data, we consider the cumulative distribution for Pq0ðxÞ, i.e.,
FqðtÞ ¼ 1  expq  t
a
 b


,
(6)
with q ¼ 1=ð2  q0Þ and a ¼ ~x0=ð2  q0Þ1=b. In connection with the q-exponential
function, the q-logarithm function is usually deﬁned as [17]
lnqðxÞ  x1q  1
1  q
,
(7)
thus lnq½expqðxÞ ¼ expq½lnqðxÞ ¼ x. By using Eq. (6), we obtain that the graph of
ln½lnqð1  FqðtÞÞ versus lnðtÞ gives a straight line since
ln½lnq½1  FqðtÞ ¼ b lnðtÞ  b lnðaÞ .
(8)
Therefore, if a cumulative distribution relative to the dielectric breakdown for a
given set of data, F dðtÞ, is well described by the q-Weibull distribution, then the q
parameter present in the q-logarithm is obtained through a linear adjustment, and
the parameter b is the slope of the graph. This procedure introduced here will be
referred as a q-Weibull plot.
To compare the usefulness of the Weibull and the q-Weibull distributions, we
analyze experimental [19] and simulation results. Fig. 1(a), which is adapted from the
work of Wu et al. [5], shows a curvature in a graph ln½ ln½1  FðtÞ versus ln½t. The

212variation of this slope is associated with oxide thickness ﬂuctuations. In fact, Wu
et al. [5] were able to generate this slope variation by performing simulations in
which the oxide thickness obeyed a Gaussian distribution. Extrapolation of the slope
of this plot from higher failure percentiles (conventional experimental window) to
lower failure percentiles leads to an error in tBD projection and, consequently, in
projection of reliability. It is necessary to use large and time-consuming sample sizes
(thousands of devices) in order to obtain tBD distributions down to lower percentiles
and avoid erroneous projections. The same tBD data can be correctly ﬁtted in the
entire range of percentiles by the q-Weibull distribution, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In
the q-Weibull plot, the data follow a straight line. We conclude that, by taking the
ﬂuctuations of the modal parameter of the Weibull distribution into account, one
obtains a statistical distribution which completely describes tBD data when oxide
ﬂuctuations are present. Therefore, the q-Weibull distribution allows improved tBD
projection for ultra-thin oxides and does not require a very large number of samples,
i.e., correct tBD extrapolation can be performed in the conventional experimental
window. This is a striking beneﬁt brought by the q-Weibull distribution.
In addition to correct tBD projection, we have found that the q-Weibull also
improves area scaling, another important consideration for reliability studies [15]. In
Fig. 2(a), we have used the data from the work of Teramoto et al. [20]. They studied
the time-dependent dielectric breakdown for 6.9 nm thin SiO2 oxides with samples
areas of 104 and 105 mm2, and subjected to a EOx ¼ 12:7 MV=cm applied ﬁeld. It
is clear, when comparing Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), that the q-Weibull distribution gives
a better area scaling than the Weibull one, another remarkable beneﬁt.
When tBD data are plotted in a limited range of percentiles, the differences between
the q-Weibull and the Weibull distributions become less apparent, but can still be
seen. As an example, we consider the simulations performed by Sombra et al. [21].
They developed a percolation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a MOS

ﬁeld strength. The hot electron injection is either through the gate or the substrate.
In Fig. 3(a) we have performed a linear ﬁt of the simulation data of Sombra et al. [21]
with the Weibull distribution, while in Fig. 3(b) we depict the same data but with
a linear ﬁt through the q-Weibull distribution. One can see once more that the
q-Weibull distribution gives a better ﬁt than the Weibull one, for small and large tBD.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we conclude that: (i) ﬂuctuation on the modal value is a mechanism
to explain deviations from the Weibull distribution in reliability studies of electronics
devices; (ii) this ﬂuctuation leads to a generalization of the Weibull distribution
(q-Weibull distribution) and a connection with the Tsallis statistics; and (iii) the
generalized Weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment of experimental and
simulated data in comparison with the Weibull one, giving improved tBD
extrapolation and area scaling. Finally, the results presented here can be very useful
for an improved description of the dielectric breakdown in the high dielectric
constant materials [2] which will be present in future generations of advanced MOS
devices.
