Band bending at semiconductor surfaces induced by chemical doping or electric ﬁelds can
create metallic surfaces with properties not found in the bulk, such as high electron mobility,
magnetism or superconductivity. Optical generation of such metallic surfaces on ultrafast
timescales would be appealing for high-speed electronics. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast
generation of a metal at the (10-10) surface of ZnO upon photoexcitation. Compared to
hitherto known ultrafast photoinduced semiconductor-to-metal transitions that occur in the
bulk of inorganic semiconductors, the metallization of the ZnO surface is launched by 3–4
orders of magnitude lower photon ﬂuxes. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy, we show that the phase transition is caused by photoinduced downward
surface band bending due to photodepletion of donor-type deep surface defects. The dis-
covered mechanism is in analogy to chemical doping of semiconductor surfaces and presents
a general route for controlling surface-conﬁned metallicity on ultrafast timescales.

hen the doping density of shallow donors is increased
above a critical value in a semiconductor, the excess
electrons, originally localized in hydrogenic potentials
at impurity sites, delocalize, and form a metallic band1. Remark-
ably, this Mott or Mott-Anderson transition happens already at
low doping densities, for example at parts per 104 atoms in
phosphorous-doped silicon1. Semiconductor-to-metal transitions
(SMTs) also occur in two dimensions at semiconductor surfaces
leading to the formation of two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs)2. In the case of oxide surfaces, 2DEG formation is often
caused by surface doping with shallow donor defects, such as
oxygen vacancies3,4 or adsorbates as, for instance, hydrogen5,6.
The positively charged impurity sites modify the surface potential,
causing downward surface band bending (BB) of the conduction
and valence band (CB and VB, respectively). At low doping
density, the BB is concentrated around isolated electron pockets at
the surface6,7. Electron delocalization occurs above a critical
electron density only2. 2DEGs have attracted considerable interest
in the past years, since, beyond metallicity, they can host phe-
nomena such as magnetism or superconductivity8,9.
Beyond chemical doping, metal-like properties of semi-
conductors can also be generated by optical excitation. At low
photoexcitation densities the optical and electronic response of
semiconductors is dominated by noninteracting free carriers and
excitons. In contrast, strong photoexcitation can lead to metal-
like behavior by three different mechanisms:
(1)
At a critical excitation ﬂuence a Mott transition between
free excitons occurs, leading to the formation of an
electron-hole plasma with quasi-Fermi levels in the CB
and VB10,11. This SMT is closely related to the above-
described Mott-Anderson transition12. In this case, the
material may exhibit metal-like optical properties and
conductivities; however, without a change of the equili-
brium band structure, there is no density of states around
the equilibrium Fermi level EF and no true SMT has
occurred.
(2)
A real SMT can be achieved by photoinduced changes to the
electronic band structure for instance due to strong carrier-
lattice or carrier–carrier interactions that change the screen-
ing of the Coulomb interaction13–15. Yet, in the case of
inorganic semiconductors, strong laser excitation (mJ/cm2)
is necessary to drive such photoinduced phase transition
(PIPT), as in the famous room temperature PIPT in
vanadium dioxide16–19. Moreover, due to the high energy
uptake, the SMT usually becomes thermally stabilized, and
the recovery of the equilibrium phase is limited by thermal
dissipation processes of nanosecond duration20.
(3)
Analogous to chemical doping, the band structure can also
be optically manipulated by photodoping21–23. One path-
way is the photoexcitation of deep donors, which creates
electron-hole pairs bound in hydrogenic potentials, with the
hole localized at the impurity site, see the left hand side of
the illustration in Fig. 1c. In contrast to free excitons, these
defect excitons are ﬁxed in space, forming a direct analogue
to the shallow donors discussed above24. As for chemical
dopants, the geometric conﬁnement of the photoholes at
the surface modiﬁes the surface potential, thereby causing
local downward BB. At a critical density of such states, a
metallic band is formed (Fig. 1c), leading to surface
metallization.
Photoinduced metallization by defect excitons was, so far, only
observed on very long timescales in the bulk of semiconductors25,

leads to persistent photoconductivity, as observed in various
semiconductors25,26. Among them is the wide band gap (3.4 eV),
intrinsically n-doped (EF ca. 0.2 eV below the CB) semiconductor
ZnO, which has a variety of native deep donor defects leading to a
broad photoluminescence signal below the fundamental band gap
energy27,28. For ZnO, a photoinduced, ultrafast control of the
conduction properties would be especially appealing, as any
application would beneﬁt from the ease of nanostructuring and
transparency to visible light of this material29,30. At semi-
conductor surfaces, the photoexcitation of defects would imitate
the effect of the gate terminal in ﬁeld effect transistors. Such
phototransistors could then be used for the control of ultrafast
currents in information technology or optoelectronic devices,
such as light emitters in the teraherz regime31.
In this article, we unveil an ultrafast photoinduced SMT con-
ﬁned to the surface of ZnO using very low excitation ﬂuences with
sub-ns decay and feasible up to at least 256 K. This dramatic effect
is enabled by photodoping of the surface: depopulation of deeply
bound in-gap (defect) states induces transient local downward BB
and populates the CB with electrons. Above a threshold ﬂuence of
only 13.6 μJ/cm2, the photoexcited electrons delocalize in a non-
equilibrium state that shows all deﬁning footprints of a metal:
Density of states around the equilibrium Fermi energy EF resulting
from a partially ﬁlled dispersive band and an electron distribution
following Fermi-Dirac statistics that thermalizes with the lattice
within 200 fs. We track the PIPT in the time domain by mon-
itoring the photodoped electron density, the nearly free electron
mass of the surface electrons, and the energy shift of the VB.
Generation and decay of the surface metal occur on the timescales
of electronic screening and electron-hole recombination, respec-
tively. The carrier density of the surface metal shows the same
build-up and decay dynamics as the downward shift of the VB
that occurs upon positive charging of the surface by photodoping.
Moreover, the effective mass evolves as a function of laser ﬂuence
with a critical form as expected for the Mott SMT between shallow
donor dopants. Remarkably, the ultrafast SMT does not require
photoinduced changes to the band structure beyond surface BB; a
sufﬁciently large number of deep donor levels should enable
similar effects at the surfaces of many semiconductors.
Results
Photostationary n-type doping. We use time- and angle-
resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES) to monitor the
PIPT. A pump-probe scheme, where a ﬁrst femtosecond laser
pulse (pump) excites the sample and a second one (probe) pho-
toemits the non-equilibrium electronic population, allows for the
measurement of the ultrafast dynamics. We apply this to a ZnO
sample of (10–10) orientation cleaned in ultrahigh vacuum
(cf. Methods). Before discussing the ultrafast metallization
dynamics, it is important to ascertain the semiconducting initial
state. Therefore, we ﬁrst investigate the sample without applied
pump laser pulse. Photoelectron spectra from the VB, similar to
those reported in ref. 32, identify the VB maximum at −3.2 eV
with respect to EF. This indicates an n-doped sample with the
equilibrium Fermi energy 0.2 eV below the CB as is typical for
ZnO28,33. In order to address the energetic region around EF, we
use probe laser pulses with hν = 6.3 eV (energy level diagram in
Fig. 1c). This energetic region is interesting, because the electronic
structure around EF deﬁnes the conduction properties. For an
undoped semiconductor no states in the forbidden gap are
expected, while doping with shallow donors below the Mott
density induces localized and hence dispersionless states just
below EF6,34. Figure 1a shows that such states exists at the Fermi
level, centered at −0.1 eV below EF and exhibiting a width of
several hundred meV. An angle-resolved spectrum in Fig. 1b
shows that the feature is also dispersionless, indicative of isolated
shallow donor dopants.
Beyond chemical doping, shallow dopants could result from
photoexcitation of deep defects as outlined in the introduction
if their lifetime is sufﬁciently long to be pumped and probed
by two subsequent laser pulses provided by our laser system
(200 kHz ≙5 μs). As the luminescence of defect excitons in
ZnO is known to extend to the μs regime27, formation of such
a photostationary state of long-lived defect excitons would
actually be expected. We test this hypothesis by tuning the
repetition rate of our laser system from normally 200 kHz down
to 5 kHz, which varies the separation of two subsequent laser
pulses from 5 to 200 μs. As displayed in the inset of Fig. 1a, the
photoelectron intensity drops by almost 50%, showing that a
photostationary state is at the origin of the shallow donor
signal. The detailed properties of this photostationary state
population are out of the scope of the present publication
and are discussed elsewhere35. We conclude that the dis-
persionless feature at −0.1 eV below EF results from photosta-
tionary defect excitons that act like shallow donors. We will
demonstrate in the following that photoinduced enhancement
of the defect exciton and, thus, shallow donor density can lead
to metallization of the ZnO surface exclusively on femto- to
picosecond timescales after optical excitation.
The ultrafast PIPT. In order to drive the ultrafast SMT we excite
the sample resonantly with the band gap (hνpump = 3.43 eV) and
monitor the photoinduced dynamics with time-delayed (Δt)
probe pulses (hνprobe = 6.3 eV). With this pump photon energy, it
is possible to drive optical transitions across the gap as well as
transitions from occupied in-gap states to the CB. Figure 1d
shows the evolution of the PE intensity as a function of Δt and
energy with respect to EF. The photoresponse of the sample is
characterized by a large PE signal below the equilibrium EF,
which arises immediately after time zero and persists for several
hundred ps. A video of the angle-resolved spectra as a function of
Δt gives an impression of the process (Supplementary Movie 1).
The angular distribution of the photoelectron intensity, averaged
from 4–8 ps, is shown in Fig. 1f. It exhibits a broad feature of few
100 meV width, which is cut by EF and shows a curvature, to the
eye most apparent at low energies. We can extract the curvature
by ﬁtting the data with a Gaussian peak multiplied by a Fermi-
Dirac distribution (other methods give the same result, see Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). The peak positions describe a parabola with
meff = 1.2(1) me, i.e., the band nearly exhibits the free electron
mass me. Thus, at small positive delays, ZnO shows all deﬁning
characteristics of a metal: a dispersive band, cut by the equili-
brium EF, indicative of a SMT.
To further conﬁrm the above ﬁnding we analyze the angle-
integrated PE spectra in the ﬁrst ps after excitation (Fig. 1e). The
excitation of metals with fs laser pulses initially leads to a heating
of the electronic subsystem and a subsequent equilibration with
the phonon bath within the ﬁrst ps36. Photoexcited ZnO behaves
analogously to photoexcited metals: The spectra exhibit a
characteristic change of the high-energy tail around EF, which
can be described by a Fermi-Dirac distribution with a delay-
dependent temperature (data and ﬁts in Fig. 1e, cf. Methods). The
resulting time-dependent electronic temperature is plotted in the
inset of Fig. 1e. Starting at 1300 K, it decays due to equilibration
with the lattice within approx. 200 fs. The photoinduced phase
thus shows electron–electron and electron–phonon interaction as
expected for a metal.
To quantify the temporal evolution of the PIPT, we spectrally
integrate the photoinduced electron signal below EF (purple),

3which is proportional to the electron density in the metallic band,
and plot its time dependence together with the evolution of the
band curvature 1/meff (green markers) in Fig. 2a. Electron density
and curvature of the metallic band show a two-fold build-up
(τ1 = 20(20) fs, τ2 = 1.20(15) ps), which is followed by a decay on
a timescale of hundreds of ps (τ3 = 219(13) ps); see Methods for
details on the ﬁtting. As localized states are dispersionless, the rise
of the curvature 1/meff can be viewed as dynamic delocalization of
the photoexcited electrons and the subsequent decrease of 1/meff
during the decay as dynamic localization37. The degree of
localization is correlated with the photoexcited electron density.
We conclude that the free electron-like metal is generated
abruptly within the experimental resolution on the timescale of
electronic screening11,38 and decays on a sub-nanosecond
timescale.
It should be noted that the photostationary population of
shallow donors discussed in the previous section spectrally
overlaps with the metallic band. It seems highly likely that the
reduction of the surface electron density, accompanied by the
dynamic localization, eventually funnels into the localized
photostationary population, as discussed later in more detail.
In order to determine the threshold ﬂuence of the PIPT, we
tune the excitation ﬂuence across a wide range, from few to tens
of μJ/cm2. Figure 2b shows the curvature 1/meff as a function of
ﬂuence. Below the threshold ﬂuence of Fc = 13.6 μJ/cm2, the
pump laser pulse induces an electron population below EF with a
ﬂat angular distribution (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), as observed
for excitons38 and also reminiscent of the photostationary
response resulting from long-lived defect excitons as discussed
above. Also no cooling of a hot thermalized electron population is
observed below Fc (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). Thus, low ﬂuence
photoexcitation creates a localized, non-interacting electron
population. Above Fc, 1/meff increases monotonously and,
simultaneously, the hot electron cooling indicative of the metallic
phase starts developing (Supplementary Fig. 2h–j). We ﬁnd
meff = 0.7 me for the highest ﬂuence in our experiment. In order
to test whether the effective mass can be viewed as an order
parameter of this phase transition, we ﬁt the data in Fig. 2b using
the inverse of
meff ¼ A F  Fc

Þα þ m0
ð1Þ
where A is a proportionality constant, α the critical exponent and
m0 an offset. The ﬁt coincides with the data. Such critical behavior
is predicted from the Mott-Hubbard theory of the Mott SMT39
and has been observed experimentally upon chemical doping in
three40 as well as in two dimensions41. Remarkably, we observe
this trend after photoexcitation in the ultrafast time domain,
which suggests that photoexcitation indeed acts like chemical
doping already on femtosecond timescales. It should be noted
that at high doping density the effective mass of the metallic band
would be expected to reach the CB meff42. This is conﬁrmed by
ﬁxing FC to 13.6 μJ/cm2, resulting in m0 = 0.2(6) me, which is in
agreement with the CB effective mass of 0.25 me43.
The surface photodoping mechanism. We showed that a pho-
toinduced SMT occurs in ZnO. At low ﬂuence, the excited carriers
do not interact beyond exciton formation, which is also in agree-
ment with earlier work on weakly photoexcited ZnO surfaces44.
Above FC, a transient metal phase is generated. The behavior of the
effective mass as a function of pump laser ﬂuence is consistent with
a Mott transition, either of free or defect excitons. Such a transition
also explains the dynamic change of the effective mass during
delocalization (at increasing exciton density) and subsequent loca-
lization (at decreasing exciton density).
A crucial aspect of the photoinduced metal phase is that the
quasi-EF in the metallic band equals the equilibrium EF for all
excitation densities (cf. Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2). This
means that the SMT goes beyond a Mott transition between free
excitons without changes to the equilibrium electronic band
structure: The exciton binding energy in ZnO is 60 meV, which is
not enough to create a state at the Fermi level, as the equilibrium
EF is located 200 meV below the bulk CB. Thus, at low ﬂuence, no
electronic states below EF can arise due to free excitons. Likewise,
above the Mott density, the free electron-like population in the
CB would be 200 meV above EF. Photoexcitation must therefore
change the equilibrium band structure. This could be reached, for
instance,
via
band
gap
renormalization
(BGR)
due
to
carrier–carrier screening10. BGR would shift the CB downward,
and at the same time the VB would move upward45. However,
also photodoping with defect excitons could lead to electron
energies below those expected for free excitons if the doping was
conﬁned to the surface: The depopulation of surface defects
would result in positive surface charges. This modiﬁcation of the
surface potential leads to local downward BB toward the surface,
in analogy to chemical doping of semiconductor surfaces. Such
local downward BB can reach several hundred meV below the
Mott limit, as shown for ZnO doped with hydrogen6. In the case
of photodoping, contrary to BGR, the VB should shift downward.
In order to distinguish the BGR and the surface photodoping
scenario, we determine the energetic position of the VB upon
photoexcitation. A probe photon energy of hνprobe = 4.25 eV
gives access to the VB in a two-photon photoemission process
(see the inset in Fig. 3a). A pump laser ﬂuence above the SMT
threshold FC is used. Figure 3b compares a VB spectrum at

few ps (red). Clearly, the VB is transiently shifted to lower
energies. The false color plot in Fig. 3a shows that the downward
shift occurs abruptly and persists for several hundred ps. Based
on this, we exclude BGR as the driving mechanism and conclude
that the depopulation of deep defects at the ZnO surface lies at
the origin of the PIPT. It should be noted that BGR most likely
still occurs, contributing to the downward shift of the CB.
However, the downward shift of the VB shows that the dominant
process affecting the electronic band structure is photoinduced
surface BB. Note that the VB shift is not entirely rigid but that the
peak also appears broadened and has a lower amplitude (Fig. 3b).
This observation is consistent with surface BB, where not all
probed unit cells along the surface normal exhibit the same shift,
as noted previously for chemical doping46. Due to this averaging
effect it is impossible to quantiﬁy the maximum BB at the very
surface46. Still, the observed VB position is a qualitative marker of
downward BB due to positive surface charging.
Beyond monitoring band positions, trARPES offers another
direct way of probing that the surface is indeed positively charged
after photoexcitation: As shown previously for GaAs47, a change
of the surface charge leads to a short-ranged electrostatic ﬁeld
that extends into the near-surface vacuum region. In a pump-
probe experiment, photoelectrons emitted by the probe laser
pulse are decelerated by this pump-induced ﬁeld at small negative
pump-probe delays Δt < 0, when the photoelectrons are still close
to the surface47. As discussed in great detail by Yang et al.47, this
effect leads to a downward shift of the energetic position of the
detected probe electrons as a function of negative pump-probe
delay. The shift is strongest close to time zero and gets weaker at
larger negative pump-probe delays47,48. In our experiment, the
data in Fig. 1d clearly show that such a downward shift of the
photostationary state signal probed by hνprobe = 6.3 eV occurs for
Δt < 0 on a 100 ps timescale. The downward shift at negative
delays unambiguously demonstrates that the surface is positively
charged due to photoexcitation by the pump laser pulse. Note
that such photoinduced changes of the surface charge and the
resulting change of surface BB are well-known as surface
photovoltage phenomena49. Both, increase and decrease of BB
have been demonstrated in the ultrafast time domain50.
The ﬁnal link between the depopulation of deep defects at the
ZnO surface and the SMT is given in Fig. 2a, where we compare
the VB downward shift as a function of Δt (black markers) to the
time-dependent electron density in the metallic band (XC, purple
markers) obtained under the same excitation conditions. As
evidenced by a global ﬁt (blue curve), both transients agree
perfectly for all timescales, from ultrafast (abrupt and delayed)
rise to decay. We conclude that the surface is photodoped by the
photoexcitation of deep defects. Thereby, the pump laser pulse
populates the CB with electrons and creates localized positive
charges at the surface that induce downward BB (Fig. 3c). At low
pump laser ﬂuence, surface-conﬁned defect excitons are formed
and the downward band bending is local. Upon crossing FC, a
Mott transition occurs and a metallic band at the surface arises
(Fig. 1c). Downward BB causes the formation of electronic states
in both, the excitonic as well as the surface metal phase, below the
equilibrium EF.
Energetic position and chemical origin of the deep defect
levels. The question about the energetic position and chemical
nature of the unexcited deep defect states in the ZnO band gap
remains. We address the former by varying the pump photon
energy. Photoexcitation will charge the surface positively and lead to
the SMT only if the pump photon energy is sufﬁcient to excite
electrons from deep donor levels to normally unoccupied states.
By tuning the pump photon energy below the fundamental gap of
3.4 eV28 we can exclusively address in-gap states. As before, the
energetic position of the VB in the time domain unveils whether
the surface is charged positively by photoexcitation. Figure 3d
shows that downward BB is still induced by photoexcitation with
hνpump = 3.2 eV (full width half maximum: 0.1 eV). This unam-
biguously conﬁrms that, downward BB, and hence the PIPT, is not
driven by excitations across the ZnO band gap (3.4 eV). Com-
plementarily, Fig. 3e demonstrates that photoexcitation with
hνpump = 3.0 eV does not induce downward surface BB, i.e., this
photon energy is not sufﬁcient to depopulate the relevant defect
states. This shows that the in-gap states responsible for the SMT
must lie deeply in the band gap, closer than 0.4 eV above the VB
maximum. Note that, likely due to the close proximity to the high
density of states of the VB maximum, no separate peak due to

5the deep defects can be detected in the photoemission data. The
experimental spectra only exhibit a strongly broadened VB edge
(Fig. 3b).
Defects could be produced at the ZnO surface due to the
surface cleaning procedure, which involves annealing in ultrahigh
vacuum (cf. methods). The only native defects in ZnO that have a
low formation energy and form an occupied state deep in the
band gap are lattice vacancies, i.e., oxygen or zinc vacancies28.
Both can be created during high temperature treatment as shown
by mass spectroscopy51,52. However, zinc vacancies can be ruled
out as they should be negatively charged in thermodynamic
equilibrium28. Photoexcitation of such states would only diminish
the number of negative charges at the surface, and hence reduce
existing upward BB instead of creating downward BB. In contrast,
oxygen vacancies are neutral in equilibrium and induce a state
0.4 eV above the VB maximum according to hybrid DFT
calculations53, in close agreement with the photon energy
dependence reported above.
In order to test the hypothesis that annealing causes the deep
defects, we varied the annealing temperature and checked the
inﬂuence on the photoinduced metallization dynamics. As shown
in Fig. 4 the PE intensity of the photoinduced metal phase is
higher by a factor of 2–3 when the sample was annealed at 950 K
compared to annealing at 750 K. This directly shows that the
photoexcitation by the pump laser pulse addresses states created
during the annealing step at the ZnO surface.
The above observation compares well with previous work by
ref. 51, who found that oxygen vacancies are formed above 700 K
with increasing efﬁciency as the temperature is raised. Hence, it
seems likely that oxygen vacancies cause the deep defect levels.
Discussion
The photodoping process and the associated timescales are illu-
strated in Fig. 5. Upon arrival, the pump laser pulse depopulates
deep donor defects at the surface and populates the CB with
electrons (process 1). Subsequently, with τ1 = 20(20) fs, down-
ward surface BB builds up, shifting the CB below EF. In the
regime of low ﬂuence photoexcitation by the pump laser pulse,
localized electron pockets are formed in proximity of the surface,
and the BB is a local effect only6. An electron bound to a charged
impurity site is part of a defect exciton. This is conceptually
identical to a shallow donor dopant. Above the critical photo-
excitation ﬂuence Fc = 13.6 μJ/cm2, a Mott transition occurs: The
CB electrons, originally localized at the defect centers, delocalize
and generate the surface metal phase. This delocalization
(decreasing meff) occurs simultaneously with the band structure
change on a timescale of electronic screening.
After the abrupt laser excitation, the downward shift of the VB,
the electron density of the surface metal, and the degree of
delocalization increase further with τ2 = 1.20(15) ps. We interpret
this as hole trapping at surface defect sites (process 2), which
enhances the photodoping density at the surface. Consequently,
the surface is charged even more positively, which leads to an
increase in surface BB. A resolution-limited upper boundary of
80 ps for this process was recently identiﬁed by X-ray absorption
spectroscopy54 and few-ps time constants were determined by
optical spectroscopy27. However, we note that hole polaron for-
mation55 may result in similar dynamics.
Eventually, part of the CB electrons recombine with the surface
defects and, as the doping density is reduced, the remaining elec-
trons localize (increasing meff) with τ3 = 219(13) ps (process 3).
This back-transition to the semiconducting state is at least one
order of magnitude faster than, for example, the decay of the
photoinduced SMT in VO220. A fraction of the remaining defect
excitons has a lifetime that exceeds the inverse repetition rate of our
laser system. They lead to the photostationary n-type doping of the
surface and appear as the shallow donor signal at negative delays.
Interestingly, the above processes do not require cryogenic
temperatures: The PIPT can be realized between 100 K up to at
least 256 K, i.e., close to room temperature (Supplementary
Fig. 3).
In summary, we unveiled a photoinduced ultrafast SMT at the
surface of ZnO with a very low threshold ﬂuence. The mechanism
is simple and universal: Photodepletion of in-gap states (deep
donors) causes photodoping of the surface, which leads to local
downward BB and eventually a partially ﬁlled metallic band
below EF. All our experimental observations are consistent with
this mechanism, from positive surface charging and downward
BB that occurs simultaneously with the SMT, to the (dynamic)
delocalization of the surface electrons. The same mechanism
should lead to PIPTs at surfaces or interfaces of other semi-
conductors with a sufﬁciently high density of donor-type deep
surface defects. Beyond technological implementations of ZnO as
an ultrafast, transparent photoswitch with the transient properties
of an equilibrium metal, this work is the starting point for studies
of 2DEGs with emerging properties beyond metallicity in the
ultrafast time domain.
Fig. 4 Sensitivity of the photoresponse to the surface conditions. PE
spectra recorded with hνprobe = 6.3 eV and hνpump = 3.4 eV (ﬂuence
140 μJ/cm2) at a pump-probe delay of 5 ps using two different annealing
temperatures during the sample preparation (cf. methods and see text).
The same ﬂuence of pump as well as probe laser pulses is used for
both shown spectra, hence the absolute PE intensity can be compared.
After annealing at 750 K (blue), the photoelectron intensity of the pump-
induced metal phase is by a factor of 2–3 smaller than after annealing at
950 K (red).
Fig. 5 Scheme of the pump-induced processes. Photoexcitation resonant
to the ZnO band gap populates the CB and depopulates surface defect
states leading to downward surface BB; above the threshold ﬂuence FC the
electrons delocalize and form the metal phase (process 1). Delayed
increase of the BB occurs due to hole trapping at surface defect sites
(process 2). The PIPT recovers as the surface charge is reduced by
electron-hole recombination (process 3).

Sample preparation. The ZnO(10–10) sample was purchased from MaTeck
GmbH and is prepared by repeated cycles of Ar+-sputtering (0.75 keV, 8 μA)
succeeded by 30 min annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (Tmax = 950 K, heating rate
30–40 K min−1). The surface cleanliness is conﬁrmed by LEED and photoemission
measurements of the work function.
trARPES measurements. Photoemission measurements are performed in situ
using a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (PHOIBOS 100, Specs GmbH). A
bias voltage of 1.5 eV is applied with respect to the sample. The EF reference is
taken from the gold sample holder, which is in electrical contact with the sample
surface. Pump and probe laser pulses are generated from a regenerative ampliﬁer
system running at 200 kHz and several optical parametric ampliﬁers (OPAs)
working at 200 kHz (PHAROS, internal OPA, Orpheus-N-2H, Orpheus-N-3H by
Light Conversion). 6.3 eV laser pulses are reached by frequency quadrupling of the
1.55 eV output of the internal OPA. Pump pulses with 3.2–3.4 eV and probe pulses
with 4.25 eV are created in the Orpheus-N-2H and 3H, respectively. All mea-
surements shown in the main text are performed at 100 K.
Fit functions. The ﬁt functions for extracting the time constants (Fig. 2a) consist of
a double exponential rise and a single exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian
peak representing the cross correlation of pump and probe laser pulses. The latter
is determined from high-energy cuts in the ZnO pump-probe data in case of using
6.3 eV as probe photon energy, yielding a cross correlation width of 115(17) fs (full
width half maximum). In the case of using 4.25 eV as probe photon energy, the
cross correlation is measured in situ by pump-probe photoemission from a tan-
talum sheet yielding 71(1) fs (full width half maximum). The rise and decay time
constants are the result of a global ﬁt to the PE intensity around EF and to the VB
shift, as shown in Fig. 2a. The time resolution in the experiments is limited by the
accuracy of determining the pump-probe cross correlation that is used for the
convolution.
The ﬁt function to extract the electronic temperature of the metallic state is a
Gaussian peak multiplied by a Fermi-Dirac distribution, convolved with a Gaussian
peak accounting for the energy resolution of the experiment (50 meV).
