ABSTRACT
We present measurements of interfacial Gilbert damping due to the spin pumping eﬀect in Ni81Fe19=W heterostructures. Measurements
were compared for heterostructures in which the crystallographic phase of W, either α(bcc)-W or β(A15)-W, was enriched through deposi-
tion conditions and characterized using X-ray diﬀraction and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Single-phase
Ni81Fe19=α-W heterostructures could be realized, but heterostructures with β-W were realized as a mixed α-β phase. The spin mixing
conductances for W at interfaces with Ni81Fe19 were found to be signiﬁcantly lower than those for similar heavy metals such as Pd and Pt,
but comparable to those for Ta, and independent of enrichment in the β phase.

I. INTRODUCTION
The heavy metals Ta, W, and Pt have drawn attention as charge-
to-spin-current-converters using spin Hall and related eﬀects.1–4 Beta
phase W, β-W, with the topologically close-packed A15 structure,5
possesses a “giant” spin Hall angle of θSH  0:3–0:4.3,6 The spin
transport properties of β-W, such as the spin Hall angle θSH and
spin diﬀusion length λSD, have been characterized by diﬀerent
methods.3,6–8 In these studies, the metastable β-W layers were depos-
ited directly on the substrate, were only stable for small W thickness,
and were presumably stabilized through residual water vapor or
oxygen on the substrate surface; thicker W ﬁlms typically revert to
the stable (bcc) α phase.
Recently, some of us9–11 have optimized a diﬀerent method to
stabilize the metastable-β-phase, using the introduction of N2 gas12
while sputtering at low power. Relatively thick (over 100 nm)
monophase β-W ﬁlms could be stabilized this way, when deposited
on glass substrates. This technique has allowed deposition of
majority β phase W for 14 nm W ﬁlms on CoFeB, as CoFeB/W
(14 nm), and of minority β phase for 14 nm W ﬁlms on Ni and
Ni81Fe19 (“Py”), as Ni/W(14 nm) and Py/W(14 nm). In the present
work, we have prepared both monophase Py/α-W (here Py/“α”-W)
and mixed phase Py=(α þ β)-W (here Py/“β”-W) heterostructures
using our optimized sputtering technique to enrich the fraction of
β-W. Crystallographic phases of W were characterized by X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy (HR-XTEM); secondary structural information
was provided by electrical resistivity measurements at room tem-
perature. We note that our measurements cannot distinguish
between purely metallic, A15 β-W, and A15 W oxide or nitride
(e.g., W3O); the identity of β-W as a purely metallic phase or a
compound is a longstanding controversy.12,13
In ferromagnet (FM)/normal metal (NM) heterostructures,
pure (chargeless) spin currents can be injected from the FM into
the NM by exciting ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in the FM
layer, “pumping” out the spin current.14,15 If the spin current is
absorbed in the NM layer, the inﬂuence of “spin pumping” can be
observed through the increase in the linewidth of the resonance,
proportional to frequency ω as Gilbert damping, due to the loss of
angular momentum from the precessing spin system.14,15 The
eﬃciency of the spin pumping eﬀect for a given interface is charac-
terized through the spin mixing conductance (SMC) g"#
FM=NM.

Published under license by AIP Publishing.The SMC is also an important parameter for the interpretation of
inverse spin Hall eﬀect (ISHE) measurements,4,16 in which the spin
Hall angle θSH is measured by pumping chargeless spin current
into the NM by FMR and measuring spin-to-charge current con-
version through the generated charge current. Measurements of
spin mixing conductance for Py=α-W and Py=β-W have not been
reported previously, although some measurements have been
reported for W oxide.8 For these measurements, the simplest way
to isolate the contribution of the FM/NM interface to the damping,
and thus the spin pumping eﬀect and spin mixing conductance
g"#
FM=NM, is to deposit the FM on the bottom and the NM on top,
so that comparison structures without the NM layer have nearly
identical microstructure. The ability to deposit enriched β-W on Py
rather than on an insulating substrate is thus important for the
measurement of spin mixing conductance of Py=β-W. In this
paper, we report measurements of spin mixing conductances for
Py/“α”-W and
Py/“β”-W
interfaces
using
variable-frequency,
swept-ﬁeld FMR, as in our previous work.17–19
II. SAMPLE PREPARATION
Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) magnetron sputtering was used to
deposit substrate=Ta(5 nm)=Cu(5 nm)=Ni81Fe19 (Py)/W/Cu(5 nm)/
Ta(5 nm) heterostructures on both oxidized Si and glass substrates
at room temperature, with base pressure better than 2  108 Torr.
The samples consist of two thickness series in “α”-W and “β”-W
for a total of four series. In the ﬁrst thickness series, the thickness of
Py (tPy ¼ 5 nm) was ﬁxed and the thickness of W was varied, with
tW ¼ 2, 5, 10, and 30 nm, for both “α”-optimized and “β”-optimized
conditions. This thickness series was used for resistivity measure-
ments, X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) (tW ¼ 10, 30 nm), high-resolution
cross-sectional
transmission
electron
microscope
(HR-XTEM)
(tW ¼ 30 nm), and FMR characterization. In the second thickness
series, the thickness of W (tW ¼ 10 nm) was ﬁxed and the thickness
of Py was varied, with tPy ¼ 3, 5, 10, and 20 nm, also for both “α”
and “β” conditions. This thickness series was used only for FMR
characterization. The same stacks without W layers, Py(3, 5, 10, and
20 nm), were deposited as reference samples for FMR measurements.
One heterostructure with reverse deposition order, “α”-W(10 nm)/Py
(5 nm), was deposited in the absence of N2 gas and characterized by
XRD and FMR; this was not possible for “β”-W because the β phase
cannot be stabilized on Cu underlayers.10
The W layers in all samples were deposited with 10 W power,
nearly constant deposition rate (,0:1 A
 =s) and an Ar pressure of
3  103 Torr. Nitrogen gas, with 1:2  105 Torr pressure mea-
sured by a residual gas analyzer, was introduced to promote the
growth of β phase W.10
III. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION
Crystalline phases of W in the Py/W heterostructures were
characterized primarily by XRD (Sec. III A), with supporting mea-
surements by HR-XTEM (Sec. III B), and ﬁnally with some indirect
evidence in room-temperature electrical resistivity measurements
(Sec. III C). Our basic ﬁndings are that ﬁlms deposited without N2,
optimized for “α”-W, are nearly single-phase α in Py/“α”-W, while
in the Py/“β”-W optimized heterostructures, deposited in the pres-
ence of N2, the W layers are mixed α þ β phase, with a roughly
50%–50% mixture of α-W and β-W averaged over a 10 nm ﬁlm.
The phase composition within the ﬁrst 5 nm of the interface may
have a slightly greater fraction of α-W, but β-W could be positively
identiﬁed here as well.
A. X-ray diffraction
Both symmetric (θ2θ) and grazing-incidence, ﬁxed sample
angle X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) scans were carried out on Py(5 nm)/
W(10 nm) and Py(5 nm)/W(30 nm) heterostructures deposited on
glass substrates. The scans are compared for “α”-W and “β”-W
depositions. Scans were recorded using Cu Kα radiation and a com-
mercial diﬀractometer.
The symmetric (θ2θ) scans, with scattering vector perpen-
dicular to ﬁlm planes, are presented ﬁrst. We point out some
obvious features of the symmetric XRD spectra, shown in Figs. 1(a)
and 1(b). For the Py/“α”-W(30 nm) ﬁlm in Fig. 1(a), all peaks can
be indexed to the close-packed planes, Cu(111)/Py(111) (fcc) and
α-W(110) (bcc). The small peak at 2θ ¼ 36 can be indexed to the
reﬂection of a small amount of Cu Kβ radiation from α-W(110).
Moving to the thinner α phase ﬁlm in Fig. 1(b), Py/“α”-W(10 nm),
it is still the case that all reﬂections can be indexed to the close-
packed Cu(111)/Py(111) and α-W(110) planes. However, there is
greater structure in these reﬂections, presumably due to ﬁnite-size
oscillations (Laue satellites), expected to be more evident in thinner
ﬁlms. Nearly identical spectra are recorded for the 10 nm “α”-W ﬁlms
regardless of deposition order: Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm) and “α”-W
(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) ﬁlms scatter X-rays very similarly, as shown in
Fig. 1(b). We should note that Cu deposited on Ta has strong {111}
texture in our ﬁlms. Py (Ni81Fe19) deposited on Cu also has strong
{111} texture; growth of Py on Cu and vice versa is found to be largely
coherent within grains. Both layers are fcc with similar lattice parame-
ters: aCu  3:61 A
 for Cu10,20 and aPy  3:55 A
 for Py,10,21 with a
small misﬁt strain of ϵ ¼ jaCu  aPyj=aCu  2%. The XRD peaks for
(111)-reﬂections in bulk phases, broadened by ﬁnite-size eﬀects
(FWHM  1:7 for 5 nm ﬁlms, using the Scherrer equation22,23), are
very close to each other, at 44:2 (Py) and 43:4 (Cu), respectively, so
we expect (and have observed) one averaged peak for Cu and Py.
The nominal “β”-W ﬁlms (red lines) clearly show the presence
of the β phase through the unique β-W(200) reﬂection at 2θ ≃36.
This unique reﬂection is very strong in the “β”-W(30 nm) hetero-
structure [Fig. 1(a)] but weaker as a proportion of the total intensity
in the thinner “β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure [Fig. 1(b)]. In Fig. 1(a),
experimental β-W(200) and β-W(210) reﬂections have intensities in
a ratio similar to the theoretical scattering intensity ratios for
randomly-oriented β grains. This is not the case for the thinner
“β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure in Fig. 1(b); here, the unique β-W
(200) peak is less intense than expected. We interpret the relative
weakness of β(200) as the presence of a large fraction of α grains in
the nominal Py/“β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure.
In order to quantify the amount of α-W in the nominal
“β”-W ﬁlm, we have carried out grazing-incidence measurements
of Py(5 nm)/W(10 nm) samples (20  2θ  100) on the same
diﬀractometer, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The samples were mea-
sured at a ﬁxed source position of 5 with 0:1 step size, 0:25 ﬁxed
slit, and the 15 mm beam mask. From the TEM measurements in
Fig. 2(b), we ﬁnd that the deposited “α”-W ﬁlms have {110}

{011}α-W reﬂections away from the surface normal. Thus, with the
grazing-incidence geometry, in which the scattering vector does not
remain perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane, the relative intensities of
the peaks will not match theoretical calculations (vertical lines)
based on randomly-oriented, untextured ﬁlms. For example, the
α-W(200) peak (blue, ≏58 in 2θ) almost vanishes in the XRD
scan here, due to the {011}α-W texture.
Here, we focus on the α-W(211) peaks near 2θ ¼ 72,
observed in both Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W samples. As shown in

ﬁtted as the sum of the Lorentzian peak and identical background,
assumed quadratic in 2θ, for both Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W
samples. First, we ﬁt the α-W(211) peak (blue) in the Py/“α”-W
sample to the summed function to determine the Lorentzian peak
and quadratic background parameters. Next, we use this ﬁtted
background in the ﬁt to the α-W(211) peak (red) in the Py/“β”-W
sample. The two ﬁtted α-W(211) peaks are shown as blue (for
Py/“α”-W) and red (for Py/“β”-W) dashed lines in the inset of
Fig. 1(c). The ﬁts reproduce the experimental data well in the ﬁtted
region. The integrated α-W(211) peak (i.e., the 2θ-integrated area
between the measured data and the ﬁtted background) for the
Py/“β”-W sample has roughly half the intensity of the integrated
peak for the Py/“α”-W sample. Assuming that the nominal α-W is
100% α phase and that the α grains in mixed phase “β”-W have
similar {110} texture, as is supported by the HR-XTEM measure-
ments in Figs. 2 and 3, we conclude that the Py/“β”-W(10 nm) ﬁlm
is roughly 50% α-W and 50% β-W.
B. Transmission electron microscopy
The phases of the nominal Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(30 nm) and the
nominal Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(30 nm) samples deposited on oxidized Si
substrates were characterized in high-resolution cross-sectional
imaging, selected-area diﬀraction, and focused-beam nanodiﬀrac-
tion, by transmission electron microscopy (for details, see Ref. 32).
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional image and diﬀraction pattern
for the nominal Py/“α”-W(30 nm) heterostructure. First, one can
see from the mass contrast between W and the 3d transition metal
elements (Ni, Fe, Cu) that the Py/W and W/Cu interfaces are rela-
tively ﬂat and sharp on the scale of the image resolution of ≏3 nm,
presumably broadened by topographic variation through the
thickness of the TEM foil. Second, based on (less pronounced)
diﬀraction contrast parallel to the interface, the grains appear to be
columnar, in many cases extending through the ﬁlm thickness,
with an average (lateral) grain diameter of 10–20 nm. The
selected-area diﬀraction (SAD) pattern can be indexed according to
unique (111)Py//(011)α-W ﬁber texture, as shown by the hexagonal
arrangement (60 angles) of the {011} reﬂections in α-W, and the
arrangement of {111} reﬂections in Py, ≏70:5 away from the
(vertical) ﬁber axis. The calculated diﬀraction spots based on {111}
Py//{011}α-W ﬁber texture with 1-fold rotational symmetry about
the ﬁlm-normal axis are shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b); good
agreement is found.
Cross-sectional images and diﬀraction patterns for the Py/
“β”-W(30 nm) heterostructure are shown in Fig. 3. Here again, in
Fig. 3(a), the mass contrast shows similarly well-deﬁned interfaces,
but the topographic variations have a shorter wavelength, due pre-
sumably to smaller, more equiaxed grains in the mixed-phase
“β”-W. Circles indicate areas where convergent nanobeam electron
diﬀraction (CBED) patterns were taken. The diﬀraction patterns
over these small regions can be indexed to single phases: fcc
Ni81Fe19 (Py) in green, bcc α-W in blue, and A15 β-W in red.
The CBED patterns in Fig. 3(a) conﬁrm that the nominal
“β”-W ﬁlm is mixed-phase α-W and β-W. The critical question for
distinguishing the spin mixing conductances of α-W and β-W in
Py/W is the identity of the W phase located within the ﬁrst several
nanometers of the interface with Py: the pumped spin current is
ejected through the interface and absorbed over this region; see the
x-axis of Fig. 6. We have addressed this question locally using high-
resolution imaging [see Fig. 3(b)] and over a larger area using fre-
quency analysis [see Fig. 3(c)] of the image, roughly equivalent to
SAD. In Fig. 3(b), a 10 nm area (red box) shows what appears to be
a single-crystal region with (111)[110]Py//(011)[111]α-W//(002)
[200]β-W, indicating that the β crystals may nucleate on top of the
α crystals; however, this is contrary to our previous observations10
and not distinguishable in the image from the superposition of
grains through the foil, with nucleation of β at the Py/W interface.
The discrete spatial Fourier transform (FT) of this region shows
that the four vertically/horizontally circled β-W{002} spots are
similar in intensity to the six α-W{011} spots, supporting a
similar β-W content in this region. Carrying out a spatial FT of the
full selected region within 5 nm of the interface (dotted box) in
Fig. 3(a), we can conﬁrm that β-W is indeed present adjacent to
the interface, as indicated by the β-W{002} FT spots in Fig. 3(c),
although these appear to be somewhat less intense than the α-W
{011} spots.

Four-point probe van der Pauw resistivity measurements were

and two point probes for voltage were placed at the four corners of
the square coupons. For square samples, the voltage-to-current ratios

thickness for “α”-W and “β”-W samples. The extracted resistivity
for “α” phase W ρα is found to be ≏35 μΩ cm and for “β” phase W
ρβ ≏148 μΩ cm. The resistivity for “β”-W more than four times
greater than that for “α”-W is due in large part to the much
smaller grain size for β-W and is typically observed in prior
studies.25 Here, the resistivity for “α-W” is larger by a factor of 2–3
than ﬁlms deposited at room temperature and postannealed in pre-
vious work,26 also attributable to a smaller grain size in these ﬁlms
deposited at ambient temperature. The resistivity measurements for
these thin ﬁlms might be taken as indirect evidence for the pres-
ence of the β phase in the nominal “β”-W layers.
IV. FERROMAGNETIC RESONANCE MEASUREMENTS
The four thickness series of Py(tPy)=W(tW) ﬁlms, for “α”-W
and “β”-W, as described in Sec. II were characterized using
variable-frequency ﬁeld-swept FMR using a coplanar waveguide
(CPW) with a center conductor width of 300 μm. The bias mag-
netic ﬁeld was applied in the ﬁlm plane (pc-FMR or parallel condi-
tion). For details, see, e.g., our prior work in Ref. 20.

For the ﬁrst sample thickness series Py(5 nm)=W(tW), we plot
damping parameters α extracted from the linear ﬁts, as a function
of W thickness in Fig. 6. Standard deviation errors in the ﬁt for α
are ≏2  104. The Gilbert damping α saturates quickly as a func-
tion of tW for both “α”-W and “β”-W, with almost all of the eﬀect
realized with the ﬁrst 2 nm of W. Loosely speaking, this fast satura-
tion implies a short spin diﬀusion length λSD  2 nm, so the iden-
tity of the W phase (α or β) over this length scale near the
interface is most relevant. The averaged damping, αPy=“α”W and
αPy=“β”W, is shown as horizontal dashed lines in the ﬁgure.
αPy=“α”W is slightly smaller than αPy=“β”W, but this may be within
experimental error. Due to spin pumping, the damping is enhanced
with the addition of W layers Δα ¼ αPy=W  αPy, normalized to
the Gilbert damping αPy of the reference sample without W layers.

Previous studies on W have shown that the formation of α-W
is preferred, for thicker W layers (e.g., 10 nm).3,26 We also prepared
the sample “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) with reverse deposition order,
with the same seed and cap layers, on an oxidized Si substrate.
Here, the top surface of the 10 nm thick α-W layer is pure α phase,
as shown by XRD in Fig. 1(a). We performed the same FMR mea-
surement on the reverse-order sample; its Gilbert damping
enhancement Δα is plotted as the green dot in Fig. 7. This point
almost overlaps with the measurement for the normal order sample
Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm), indirectly supporting the conclusion that
the phase of the Py/“α”-W interface is similar to the phase of the
“α”-W/Py interface, i.e., almost 100% α phase W. Note that it was
not possible to deposit a reverse-order β phase sample because no
β phase W could be stabilized on Cu using our technique.10
The FMR measurements of spin mixing conductance g"# for
Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W are new in this study. We ﬁnd that the
value is similar to that measured for Ta27 (g"# ≏10 nm2) regard-
less of the enriched phase. First-principles-based calculations
including relativistic eﬀects28 for g"# at Py/NM interfaces have
shown that Ta, next to W in the periodic table, is a good spin sink
due to its large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) but has a relatively small
g"# ≏8–9 nm2. The eﬃcient absorption of the spin current can
be connected with a large SOC from the large atomic number, and
the low SMC can be connected to relatively poor band matching
across the Py/W interface, compared with that for Py/Cu or
Py/Pt.28 The conclusion for Ta is consistent with our experimental
results for the Py/W system, i.e., the rapid saturation of Gilbert
damping within the ﬁrst 2 nm of W, indicating that W is also a
good spin sink, with a similarly low g"# ≏7 nm2.
V. DISCUSSION
We have found very little diﬀerence between the spin scatter-
ing properties (spin mixing conductance and spin diﬀusion length)
of α-W and mixed phase (α þ β)-W. The simplest interpretation is
that both spin mixing conductances and spin diﬀusion lengths are
nearly equal for the two phases. However, despite our development
of an optimized technique9–11 to stabilize the β phase, our control
over the amounts of deposited α and β phases is less than com-
plete, particularly near the Py/W interface.
The “α”-structure we deposited, Py/α-W, is nearly ≏100% α
phase. We observed no strong β-W peaks in the XRD scans
and neither crystalline structure nor diﬀraction patterns for the β
phase in HR-XTEM characterization. According to our previous
work,10,26,29 we know that ionically and covalently bonded sub-
strates/underlayers are favorable for the formation of some β-W,
whereas metallic underlayers promote α, so on Py even at a thick-
ness of 2 nm, the nominally α-W ﬁlm is fully α if deposited in the
absence of nitrogen.
In the thinnest “β”-structure which we can characterize by
XRD, Py/“β”-W(10 nm), we identify a roughly 50%–50% mixture
of α and β phases. If this balance persists at the interface as well,
the SMC cannot diﬀer by more than 10–20% for the two phases.
While the measurement of the 5 nm region near the interface
seems to show somewhat less than 50% β phase, there is still a sub-
stantial population of β-W in this region, and it would seem that a
strong diﬀerence in SMC for α-W and β-W should be resolvable if
present. Given that the measured values are very similar, we con-
clude that the α and β phases do not diﬀer strongly in this spin
transport study.
One might ask why the spin mixing conductance, in contrast
to the spin Hall angle,3 does not diﬀer much for the two phases
of W. The spin mixing conductance (SMC) g"#
FM=NM is a property of

same Py thickness. Solid lines refer to ﬁtting with Eq. (2).

Published under license by AIP Publishing.the FM/NM interface, rather than a bulk property of the NM layer.
The SMC may be approximated (in a single-band, free-electron
model) as g"#  κk2
FA=4π2, where kF is the Fermi wave number for
the NM, κ represents the number of scattering channels in units of
one channel per interface atom, and A is the total surface area of
the interface.30 Despite the possibility that bulk β-W has a stronger
eﬀective spin-orbit coupling and spin Hall eﬀect due to its A15
structure, β-W could have similar numbers of conducting channels
per atom at the FM/NM interface as α-W, which could lead to
similar values of SMC measured here.
Another possibility is that the spin diﬀusion length λSD may
vary along the W layer thickness, due to nonuniformly distributed
α-W and β-W phases in “β”-W samples. If this is true, ﬁtting a
single spin diﬀusion length for spin pumping into very thin W
layers will be problematic.31 However, because we have observed a
very rapid saturation of Gilbert damping over the ﬁrst 2 nm of W
for both “α”-W (almost pure α phase) and “β”-W (mixed phase) in
Fig. 6, we can only assign an upper bound for λSD, similarly short
in the two phases.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we report measurements of spin mixing conduc-
tances of Py/W ﬁlms with controlled amounts of α and β phase W,
measured by Gilbert damping through ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR). We ﬁnd no strong diﬀerences in the spin mixing conduc-
tances of Py/α-W and Py/β-W, measured as g"# ¼ 6:7–7:4 nm2,
although control of the β phase is seen to be more diﬃcult near the
interface with Py. Our experimental results also indicate that W, no
matter of which phase, is a good spin sink, but with relatively small
spin mixing conductance in Ni81Fe19 (Py)/W, similar to Ta in Py/Ta.

32Focused ion-beam (FIB) and FEI Helios NanoLab 660 were used to prepare
foils for TEM studies. To protect the heterostructures against the ion-beam
damage during sample preparation, amorphous platinum (1:5 μm thick) was
sputtered on the surface of the wafers by electron and ion beam. TEM and high-
resolution cross-sectional TEM (HR-XTEM) analyses were performed by image
Cs-corrected FEI Titan Themis 200 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The
nanobeam electron diﬀraction pattern (DP) technique and the Fourier transform
(FT) analysis of the HRTEM have been utilized to identify the nature of each
phase at a scale of 1–2 nm wide. The nanobeam DPs were obtained by FEI Talos
TEM operating at 200 kV. The second condenser aperture was set to 50 μm to
obtain a small beam-convergence angle. In the diﬀraction mode, the beam was
condensed to a spot (≏1–2 nm), and a convergent electron beam diﬀraction
(in this case, known as the Kossel-Möllenstedt pattern) was acquired at diﬀerent
locations on the sample.
