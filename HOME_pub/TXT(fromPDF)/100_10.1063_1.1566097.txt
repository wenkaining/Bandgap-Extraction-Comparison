We report a clear correspondence between changes in the Curie temperature and carrier density
upon annealing in epitaxially grown ~Ga,Mn!As layers with thicknesses in the range between 5 and
20 nm. The changes are dependent on the layer thickness, indicating that the ~Ga,Mn!As–GaAs
interface has importance for the physical properties of the ~Ga,Mn!As layer. The magnetoresistance
shows additional features when compared to thick ~Ga,Mn!As layers, that are at present of unknown
origin. © 2003 American Institute of Physics. @DOI: 10.1063/1.1566097#
The discovery of ferromagnetism in the dilute magnetic
semiconductor ~Ga,Mn!As1 initiated a rapid expansion in
both the experimental and theoretical investigation of this
material. Ferromagnetism in ~Ga,Mn!As is commonly re-
lated to the magnetic exchange interaction between the con-
duction holes and the magnetic moment of the localized sub-
stitutional
Mn12
ions.2
In
the
Zener
model,
the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature (TC) is directly related
to the content of Mn and the number of free charge carriers.2
The low temperature conditions necessary for epitaxial
growth
of
~Ga,Mn!As,
induces
defects
such
as
Mn
interstitials3 and As antisites4 that act as compensating do-
nors and hence, suppress ferromagnetic ordering. Experi-
mental work has shown that TC , together with the electrical
transport
properties,
can
be
changed
by
postgrowth
annealing,5–9 and Curie temperatures up to 150 K have now
been reported.7 The main mechanism for this is believed to
be a reduction of Mn interstitials which are highly mobile in
the annealing temperature range commonly used.3 So far
single ~Ga,Mn!As layers with thicknesses in the nanometer
range have not been investigated in great detail. Matsukura
et al.10 reported a decrease in TC with increasing layer thick-
ness, which is also observed by Ku et al.,7 who also investi-
gated the effect of annealing.
We have previously found that the effect of postgrowth
annealing on the shape of the magnetization curve and Curie
temperature, depends on the thickness of the ~Ga,Mn!As
layer.11 In this letter we present results of the effect of post-
growth annealing on the carrier density determined from
Hall measurements in the same Ga0.95Mn0.05As ﬁlms. We
found that the carrier density follows the changes in TC upon
annealing, in agreement with what is generally seen in
~Ga,Mn!As.6–8 Ferromagnetism has been observed down to
a thickness of 5 nm.12 In this sample, an unexplained feature
in the magnetoresistance appear at low temperatures. We
show here that this feature is also present in thicker samples
with thicknesses up to 20 nm.
The
studied
samples
are
epitaxially
grown
Ga0.95Mn0.05As layers with thicknesses in the range between
5 and 25 nm, embedded in low temperature ~LT! GaAs.11,12
For electrical transport measurements mesas are deﬁned in a
100 mm wide Hallbar geometry by UV lithography and wet
chemical etching with Au/Zn/Au contacts. Annealing is per-
formed at 240 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Two sets of
samples were annealed for 1 and 2 h, respectively, except the
15-nm-thick layer that was annealed an additional hour with-
out any signiﬁcant change in Curie temperature from that
observed after 2 h of annealing.11 The Hall measurements are
all standard four-point dc measurements performed at T
5300 mK.
For ~Ga,Mn!As a positive magnetoresistance in Hall
measurements below TC at low ﬁelds, is evidence of in-plane
magnetic anisotropy.13 This is followed by a negative mag-
netoresistance that has been understood as a reduction of
random spin-ﬂip scattering with increasing magnetic ﬁeld for
metallic samples.13,14

consistent with a scattering independent anomalous Hall con-
ductivity has been reported.5
Below TC , the anomalous Hall term leads to a rapid
increase in Hall resistance with increasing magnetic ﬁeld,
often followed by a small decrease due to the negative mag-
netoresistance. Therefore, it is often necessary to apply a
high magnetic ﬁeld in order to determine the carrier density
from the ordinary Hall-term.
Figure 1 shows the Hall- and magnetoresistance of the
15-nm-thick layer annealed for 3 h. Beside the effects de-
scribed earlier, there is an additional oscillating feature at
around 3 and 4.5 T. This feature, varying in magnitude, is
seen in all the samples with thicknesses below 20 nm. An-
nealing has some effect on the magnitude and magnetic ﬁeld
dependence of this oscillation, but no direct connection could
be found. For some samples the oscillation appears in the
Hall resistance with the same magnetic ﬁeld dependence as
in the magnetoresistance, probably originating from the
anomalous Hall term. The oscillating feature is seen to dis-
appear at higher temperatures.
The carrier density (p) has been found by ﬁtting the Hall
data to Eq. ~1! for samples with ~Ga,Mn!As layer thickness
up to 20 nm assuming either skew or side-jump scattering.
The results assuming only skew scattering are shown in Fig.
2~b!. There is a small difference in the determined carrier
density, which increases with increasing layer thickness, de-
pending on the assumed scattering mechanism where skew
scattering gives the highest values. The negative magnetore-
sistance increases with increasing layer thickness, and the
carrier density could not be determined in the 25-nm-thick
layer, in the available magnetic ﬁeld range. The carrier den-
sity increases upon annealing except for the 5 nm layer,
where it decreases. The increase upon annealing is consistent
with the reported decrease in the amount of Mn interstitials.3
The Curie temperatures, shown in Fig. 2~a!, are also seen
to increase during annealing. The Curie temperatures have
been determined by superconducting quantum interference
device magnetometery11 except for the 5-nm-thick layer,
which was determined from Hall measurements.12 This ob-
servation is contrary to recently reported results, where the
presence of a capping layer reduces TC in 10–50-nm-thick
~Ga,Mn!As layers upon annealing.7
The mean free path (l), calculated from the measured
resistivity and carrier density at T5300 mK, is shown in
Fig. 2~d!. The obtained l values are in the range between 0.4
and 0.65 nm, which is shorter than the average distance be-
tween Mn ions in ~Ga,Mn!As with 5% of Mn (;1.1 nm).
These low values for the mean free path is expected due to
the high degree of disorder in low temperature grown ~Ga,
Mn!As. The increasing mean free path upon annealing is a
consequence of reduced disorder.
The clear correspondence between the carrier density
and Curie temperature seen in Figs. 2~a! and 2~b!, suggests
that the Curie temperature is mainly governed by the number
of carriers, and not directly related to the thickness of the
layer. In Fig. 3 the Curie temperature is plotted as a function

carrier density has been determined assuming either skew- or
side-jump scattering. From a log–log plot the Curie tempera-
ture is seen to follow a p1/3 dependence to a good degree,
when the carrier density is determined by skew scattering
only. This dependence is less clear assuming only side-jump
scattering. Having data only in the range of half a decade
makes a ﬁt to the relation: TC}p1/3, predicted by Dietl et al.2
within the Zener model, questionable. Using a Mn content of
5% the term of proportionality deviates by a factor of 2 from
the value given by Ref. 2 when assuming skew scattering.
This is acceptable considering the uncertainty on the Mn
content and material parameters.
Though it is difﬁcult to speculate as to what mechanisms
are important in ~Ga,Mn!As thin ﬁlms,7 these ﬁndings sug-
gest that the ~Ga,Mn!As–LT GaAs interface plays an impor-
tant role. Theoretical calculations show that Mn ions in sub-
stitutional and interstitial positions have different energies
near the surface,15 and experiments have found segregation
of Mn on the surface of ~Ga,Mn!As.16 This implies that an-
nealing may have a larger impact on ~Ga,Mn!As layers with
thickness comparable to the interface regions and that the
Curie temperature is mainly governed by the carrier density
and hence the number of defects.
In summary, we have observed a clear correspondence
between changes in Curie temperature and carrier density
upon annealing, suggesting that the impact of defects on the
carrier density is dependent on the ~Ga,Mn!As layer thick-
ness. A local maxima in the magnetoresistance at 3–4.5 T
present only in layers with thickness below 20 nm is ob-
served, indicating that this is a thin ﬁlm property.
