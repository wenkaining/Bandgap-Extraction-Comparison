We present evidence of lattice-rotation vortices having an average radius of ∼7 nm at the ferroelectric
domain boundary of ð1-xÞPbðZn1=3Nb2=3ÞO3-xPbTiO3 (x ¼ 0.08). Maps of crystal orientations and
domain symmetry breaking are obtained using scanning convergent beam electron diffraction, which show
fractional rotation vortices near the 50° monoclinic domain walls. The merging of 2D and 1D topological
defects is consistent with inhomogeneous boundary charge and expected to have a large impact on the
domain-switching mechanisms in relaxor ferroelectric crystals and ferroelectric devices.

Topological defects, such as ferroelectric domain walls
(DWs), exhibit emergent physical properties with poten-
tial applications in electronic devices. For example, charged
DWs of BiFeO3 [1] and PbðZr; TiÞO3 [2] exhibit a
significant conductivity increase compared to bulk materi-
als, which is movable and can be advantageous for device
applications [3]. DWs involve a change in the polarization
direction and small lattice distortions. Having a large
density of mobile DWs also facilitates domain switching
and therefore dramatically enhances the susceptibility of
ferroelectrics and piezoelectric coupling coefficients [4].
Extensive studies of ferroelectric domains by micros-
copy [5,6] and diffraction [7–18] have demonstrated that
ferroelectric DWs can be categorized by the dipole tran-
sition behaviors across the boundary, which are nonchiral
DWs (Ising-like), chiral DWs (Bloch- or Néel-like), or
mixtures of both [19]. However, recent atomic resolution
electron imaging revealed polarization rotation vortex in

and

and

0, B00, B000 ¼ Zn,
Nb, Ti for PZN-PT, and Mg, Nb, Ti for PMN-PT),
exceptional piezoelectric properties [25] are obtained at
the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), where nanome-
ter-sized monoclinic domains have been reported by x-ray
diffraction [5,26], neutron diffraction [11–15], and electron
microscopy [16,18,25]. On the other hand, we know little
about the structure and properties of DWs in monoclinic
crystals. Theory predicts mechanically permissible but
slightly charged DWs parallel to f100g or f110g planes
in addition to 180° DWs [27,28]. The structural determi-
nation of DWs in general requires (1) identifying two
neighboring polarization domains, (2) determining the
transition structure between the domains, and (3) identify-
ing the nature of the polarization in the transition region.
All three tasks are experimentally difficult for determining
monoclinic and nanometer-sized domains, and conse-
quently, it was experimentally challenging to study in
relaxor ferroelectrics the coupling between electric dipoles
and strain, which can induce chirality at the DWs [29].
Here, we describe a scanning convergent beam electron
diffraction (SCBED) study of the DWs in the relaxor-based
ferroelectric crystal of PZN-8%PT. Using energy-filtered
(EF) SCBED, we have identified nm-sized domains having
monoclinic (M) Pm symmetry in single crystal PZN-8%
PT. A careful examination of the DWs revealed the
presence of lattice-rotation vortices near DWs. These
vortices involve continuous lattice rotation across length
scales of ∼15 nm in diameter.
Single crystal PZN-8%PT (unpoled flux-grown single
crystal,
Microfine
Materials
Technologies
Pte.
Ltd.,
Singapore) was selected for study. Thin crystals were
prepared along pseudocubic axes of ½100C, ½001C, and
½111C (C for pseudocubic axes) using the method
described previously [30]. The same sample preparation
procedure was applied successfully for the determination of
symmetry in single crystal BaTiO3 [31].
The principle of domain identification is based on CBED
determination of crystal symmetry. A focused electron
probe is rastered across a region of the sample and used
to record diffraction patterns. Because of the convergent
beam, the diffracted beam appears as a disk instead of a
sharp diffraction spot, and CBED has the spatial resolution
ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers [32–34].
The crystal point group can be obtained at different sample
points by careful study of 2D features in transmitted disk
and diffracted disks. Specifically, the ferroelectric polari-
zation direction, which lies in the mirror plane, can be
determined from multiple scattering effects for certain
incident beam directions. Thus, ferroelectric domains can
be identified by the change of CBED pattern symmetry
(Fig. 1). For example, the mirror direction can be used to

© 2017 American Physical Societydetermine the 60° domains in PMN-31%PT with the aid
of dynamic diffraction simulation using the Bloch wave
method [25,35]. The change in CBED pattern symmetry
is quantified using the normalized cross-correlation (γm)
value of a pair of diffraction discs related by mirror
symmetry using the algorithm previously proposed by
Kim et al. [36]. For convenience of having just one γm
value for one CBED pattern, the γm values of three pairs of
discs with the highest intensity were averaged, noted as
γm;average shown in Fig. 1(a). By scanning the electron probe
over a region of crystals and recording and quantifying
CBED patterns for scanning CBED, the crystal symmetry
can be mapped. Figure 1(d) shows an example. CBED
patterns of different γm;average values are indicated by
different colors in Fig. 1(d) [25].
For determining the crystal rotation, we use the BF disk
(transmitted beam) of CBED, which possesses the center of
symmetry belonging to the Laue diffraction group accord-
ing to Buxton et al. [32]. The location of the center of
symmetry changes when crystal rotates as illustrated in
Figs. 1(b) and 1(c).
The SCBED experiments were carried out using a JEOL
2010F FEG TEM operated at 200 kV with a convergent
beam of 2.6 nm in FWHM (full width at half maximum).
Energy filtering (EF), which improves the contrast of
CBED patterns, was performed using a Gatan imaging
filter (GIF). EF-SCBED was performed by scanning the
focused electron probe over a selected area on a 15 × 15
grid, step size of 2 nm, and through a postcolumn GIF
energy window of 10 eV. The shift and tilt of diffraction
patterns during beam scanning were minimized and cali-
brated using a silicon single crystal [37]. Following the
procedures described in [35], the symmetry of PZN-8%PT
was determined as monoclinic Pm, which agrees with the
x-ray diffraction result [12].
Nanodomains
are
observed
using
EF-SCBED.
Symmetry variations across these domains in three EF-
SCBED datasets from three different sample areas are
shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c). The scan consists of
15 by 15 points, with a step size of 2 nm. The γm;average of
the representative CBED patterns in each region are shown
in grayscale. We identified type-1 and type-2 nanodomains
with different mirror symmetry. The boundaries between
these two domains are indicated as dashed lines in the
figures.
We noticed that the center-of-mass of the intensity
distribution within the BF disc of each pattern in the
EF-SCBED dataset is not always located at the exact center.
This observation could have two possible explanations:
microscope optics and local crystal tilting. First, the
hysteresis in the scanning coils or the lens in the micro-
scope could lead to imperfect optical alignment while
scanning the beam, which results in an effective beam tilt
and a consequent intensity redistribution in the BF disc.
Second, if the crystal is not oriented on the exact zone axis,
this small angular deviation could also lead to an intensity
redistribution in the BF disc. This is shown schematically
in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). If small bending or buckling exists
during specimen preparation, the intensity redistribution in
the BF disc would mainly be shifting in a way consistent
with bending. We excluded the effects of microscope
optics by performing EF-SCBED on a Si single crystal.
This measurement defines the maximum electron beam tilt
and the lattice rotation measurement precision at 0.012
degrees. In an effort to quantify how much the crystal is
deviated from the exact zone axis, we calculated the
displacements (in pixels) of the center-of-mass of each
BF disc and converted these displacements into crystal
rotations (in degrees).
By measuring the shift in the BF disc of a CBED pattern
using this method, we determined the rotation of the crystal
and represented this rotation as a vector over nanometer-
sized sample regions. The vector at each data point
indicates the crystal rotation averaged over a volume of
∼280 nm3. Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c) show the crystal
rotation map derived from the same EF-SCBED datasets as
Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), respectively. Figure 3(a) shows a

for the mirror symmetry quantification, while crystal rotation
along the x and y axes leads to a shift in the center of the CBED

correlation coefficients of three pairs of discs labeled in orange
in (a) is taken as γm;average, whose values are shown in (d) for a
scan of 15 × 15 points or 225 CBED patterns. Here, each color
represents a different CBED pattern, whereas similar CBED
patterns are shown in the same color.

boundary and a radius of curvature of ∼7 nm calculated
from the discrete points. On the other hand, the vortex
feature is not as distinct in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). The
continuous crystal rotation is shown schematically in
Figs. 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f).
The type-1 and type-2 domains identified in Fig. 2
are associated with two distinguishable CBED patterns
that were observed along the ½100C incident direction
[Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) show the
symmetry maps where these two patterns were detected.
The highest γm values of type-1 and type-2 patterns are
detected along two different directions (A and B) as shown
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The A and B directions are rotated by
45° along the ½100C zone axis. The corresponding simu-
lated patterns for type-1 and type-2 domains are along
monoclinic Pm zone axis ½100Pm and ½010Pm, as shown in
Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), respectively. In the Pm structure model,
the polarization direction is P
⇀
S ¼ ½u; 0; vPm ¼ ½3; 0; 4Pm,
which lies in the mirror plane of Pm symmetry [12]. Along
the ½100Pm incident direction, the mirror plane is super-
imposed on ð001Þ=ð00¯1Þ reflections, which is parallel to
the A direction in Fig. 4(a). This mirror is not observed
along the ½010Pm incident direction. The projection of the
polarization lies approximately on the ð101Þ=ð¯10¯1Þ reflec-
tions, which is parallel to the B direction in Fig. 4(b). The
highest mirror symmetry in this case is detected along
direction B in the simulated pattern [Fig. 4(d)] with
γm;simulated ¼ 60%.
Quantification of mirror symmetry for Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)
gives γ1
m;A ¼ 95% and γ2
m;A ¼ 34%, respectively. (The
superscript indicates the domain type, and the subscript
denotes the mirror plane direction.) This shows that the
mirror plane of type-1 domains is along the A direction.
For the type-2 domains, a good match is obtained with
½010Pm. The γm value along the B direction of the recorded
patterns roughly agrees with the simulated value, with
γm;experimental ¼ 54%.
Based on the best matching structural model of Pm, the
orientation relationship between the type-1 and 2 nano-
domains with respect to the pseudocubic axes is shown
schematically in Fig. 5. For type-1 domains, which belong
to the ½100Pm zone axis, the monoclinic axes of aPm and
bPm are along ½100PC and ½010PC, respectively. The cPm is
slightly deviated away from the ½001PC direction with an
angle ð90° −βÞ in the aPm −cPm plane. Type-2 domains
belong to the ½010Pm zone axis, for which the monoclinic
axes of aPm and bPm are rotated by 90° with respect to the
cubic c-axis. If converting the two polarization directions
½3; 0; 4Pm and ½0; 3; 4Pm from fractional coordinates into
Cartesian
coordinates,
the
polarization
directions
in
Cartesian coordinates would be [3.03, 0.02, 4.05] and
[0.02, 3.01, 4.05], respectively. The angle between the two
vectors is 50°. The presence of 50° polarization domains is
also evidence which excludes the tetragonal (T) or rhom-
bohedral (R) symmetries, since this type of domain is only
permitted in crystals with orthorhombic or lower sym-
metries [27,28]. Bokov and Ye considered mechanically
permissible domain configurations with monoclinic Pm
symmetry. We observed regions with high symmetry,
which implies no overlapping of 1=2 type domains.
However, we cannot exclude the overlapping of 2=4
domains in high symmetry region [28].

tively. The indexing is based on simulated diffraction patterns.

157601-3Vortices form in ferroelectric crystals by two different
mechanisms. Figure 6(a) shows flux-closure domain pat-
terns associated with continuous dipole rotations have been
reported in ferroelectric thin films [21–24,36] or ferroelec-
tric nanodots [38–40]. These patterns involve continuous
dipole rotations near the vertices of triangular or quadrantal
domain boundaries. By reducing the thickness of the thin
film, ferroelectric dipole vortex-antivortex pairs can be
stabilized [24], as shown in Fig. 6(b). The continuous
rotation of the dipoles in vortex structures can also result
from depolarizing fields, which are created by incom-
pletely compensated charges at the surfaces and interfaces
[Fig. 6(c)]. Experimental evidence for a continuous rotation
of the dipoles was reported by Jia et al. [20,21] in
PbðZr; TiÞO3 at the 180° domain walls. The organization
of dipoles in vortex structures reduces depolarizing fields.
The rotation we observed is part of the lattice deforma-
tion matrix with displacement vector uðr
⇀Þ, defined by
rigid body rotation tensor ~wij ¼ ½ðeij −ejiÞ, where the
strain tensor is εij ¼ ½ðeij þ ejiÞ and the quantity eij ¼
ð∂ui=∂xjÞ. For relaxor ferroelectric crystals with mono-
clinic symmetry, disinclination exists between two domains
with an angular mismatch determined by unit cell param-
eters [28,41]. Strain accompanies the polarization rotation
due to the strong electromechanical coupling [9,10,42].
We speculate that the crystal rotation vortex can be a result
of accommodating disinclination strain and charge dis-
continuity. First, the disinclination strain can be estimated
by calculating Lagrangian finite strain tensors [43]. The
maximum strain between neighboring type-1 and type-2
unit cells [Fig. 5] calculated using lattice parameters is
1.3%, which is comparable to the 1.5% strain at the vertex
core of rhombohedral BiFeO3 [44]. However, the 1.3%
strain is relaxed by a continuous lattice rotation over 15 nm,
the diameter of the lattice rotation vortex.
Second, the depolarizing fields and effects on local
dipoles can be simplified by considering the polarization
of adjacent domains since Δ
⇀
· P
⇀
¼ ρb, where ρb is the
bound charge density, and τ
⇀¼ P
⇀
× E
⇀
, which is the torque
acting on the dipoles by the depolarization field. At 180°
charged DWs, the depolarization fields induced by bound
charge are symmetrical and the forces on the dipoles are
opposite on the two sides of the DWs, which creates a flux-
closure vortex. However, this symmetry is broken in the
case of a slightly charged monoclinic 50° DW, as shown in
Fig. 6(d). The magnitude of inhomogeneous electric fields,
E1 and E2 in type-1 and type-2 domains, respectively, are
different due to strong dielectric anisotropy of the crystal
[42]. This torque is also strongest when P
⇀
is normal to E
⇀
,
and this torque is weak in the type-I domain because its P
⇀
is
pointing out of plane. This is consistent with our obser-
vation shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), which the average
magnitude of lattice rotation in type-2 domains is larger
than that of in type-1 domains.
The above observation raises important questions about
the roles of the lattice rotation vortex in domain switching
in ferroelectric systems. Previously, first-principles calcu-
lations have predicted an intermediate state having a
coexisting toroidal moment and out-of-plane-polarization
in ferroelectric nanoparticles [45,46]. The occurrence of
lattice rotation vortices at the ferroelectric domain walls
suggests the interaction between 2D and 1D topological
defects. An analogy can be made with the presence of
magnetic vortices, known as Skyrmions. The interplay
between spin, orbital, charge, and strain degrees of freedom
associated with Skyrmions suggests a complex landscape
of topological defects in ferroelectrics that may be explored
for new applications and functionalities.
In conclusion, we observed local crystal rotation vortex
at the 50° monoclinic domain boundary. The fractional
crystal rotation vortex is attributed to depolarization fields
due to charge discontinuity across the domain walls and
their forces on local dipoles.

discussion with Dr. Kyou-Hyun Kim and Professor
