The carrier dynamics and electronic structures of type-II Weyl semimetal candidates MoTe2 and WTe2 have
been investigated by using temperature-dependent optical conductivity [σ (ω)] spectra. Two kinds of Drude peaks
(narrow and broad) have been separately observed. The width of the broad Drude peak increases with elevating
temperature above the Debye temperature of about 130 K in the same way as those of normal metals, on the other
hand, the narrow Drude peak becomes visible below 80 K and the width is rapidly suppressed with decreasing
temperature. Because the temperature dependence of the narrow Drude peak is similar to that of a type-I Weyl
semimetal TaAs, it was concluded to originate from Dirac carriers of Weyl bands. The result suggests that the
conductance has the contribution of two kinds of carriers, normal semimetallic and Dirac carriers, and this
observation is evidence of the type-II Weyl semimetals MoTe2 and WTe2. The obtained carrier mass of the
semimetallic bands and the interband transition spectra suggest the weak electron correlation effect in both
materials.

I. INTRODUCTION
Materials with linear band dispersions at the Fermi level
(EF) such as surface states of topological insulators and Dirac
semimetals have been recently attracting attention because the
very high mobility as well as high speed devices are expected
thanks to the very low effective carrier mass of the linear band
dispersion. In the case of the space- or time-reversal symmetry
breaking of Dirac semimetals, the spin degeneracy of the
Dirac band is released in the momentum space, resulting in
the formation of two Dirac bands with different spin directions
at the symmetry points with respect to high symmetry axes.
These materials are named Weyl semimetals.
Weyl semimetals are classed in two groups by the shape
of the Fermi surface. One named type-I exhibits pointlike
Fermi surfaces owing to Lorentz invariant band structures,
and another named type-II has tilted Weyl cones appearing
between electron and hole Fermi surfaces. 1T ′-MoTe2 and
1T ′-WTe2 of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
candidates of type-II Weyl semimetals [1,2]. TMD forms four
crystal structures, namely 2H, 1T, 1T ′, and Td. Theoretical
predictions are that MoTe2 is a semiconductor in 2H and
1T forms, and the electronic structure has been revealed by
optical measurements [3–5]; on the other hand, that in 1T ′
and Td forms is predicted as a semimetal [6].
MoTe2 with monoclinic β structure (P21m, No. 11) at room
temperature is regarded as a trivial metal; however, it has a
phase transition at about 240 K with a structure change to
orthorhombic 1T ′ structure (Pmn21, No. 31). 1T ′-MoTe2 (this
is denoted as MoTe2 hereafter) is believed to be a putative
Weyl semimetal [7]. MoTe2 is attracting attention owing to the
*kimura@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp
appearance of superconductivity at temperatures of 0.1 K at
ambient pressure and of 8.2 K at 11.7 GPa [8]. Mo1−xNbxTe2
has anomalous enhancement of thermopower near the critical
region between the polar and nonpolar metallic phases [9].
It is under debate whether these properties are related to the
Weyl semimetallic band structure or not.
WTe2 also has orthorhombic crystal structure (Pmn21)
below room temperature. This material has a large positive
magnetoresistance [10], and the electron and hole Fermi sur-
faces are the same size, which is consistent with other normal
semimetals [11]. In addition to the quadratic magnetoresis-
tance, a ﬁeld-linear Nernst response distinguishes WTe2 from
other dilute metals [11].
Since both MoTe2 and WTe2 have been theoretically pre-
dicted to be type-II Weyl semimetals [1,12], the investigation
of the relation of the electronic structures to interesting phys-
ical properties of these materials is important and has been
performed so far by using angle-resolved photoemission spec-
troscopy (ARPES) [13–26] and quantum oscillation measure-
ments [7,10,11,27–29]. All measurements pointed out that
electron and hole bands commonly exist on EF. By surface-
sensitive ARPES measurements, Fermi arc surface electronic
states have been also observed. The origin of the Fermi arcs
has been concluded to be the existence of Weyl points in many
experiments, but another opinion is also present [24], so the
origin is still under debate.
The evidence of the existence of Weyl points can be
observed in optical conductivity [σ (ω)] spectra. For instance,
in the σ (ω) spectra of TaAs, which is one of the type-I Weyl
semimetals, the rapid decrease of the Drude width and the
decrease of the Drude weight with decreasing temperature
have been observed [30,31]. In normal semimetals, because
carriers are mainly scattered by lattice vibrations, the electri-
cal resistivity as well as the scattering rate γ linearly increase

with increasing temperature above the Debye temperature
[32]. On the other hand, carriers at Weyl points have different
temperature-dependent γ from normal metals owing to the
increase of mobility μ (γ ∝1/μ) at low temperatures [30,33].
Therefore, the temperature dependence of γ is one of the
important indices to judge the existence of Dirac electrons of
Weyl semimallic bands.
So far, temperature-dependent σ (ω) spectra of WTe2 have
been reported by Homes et al. [34]. In the paper, owing
to the model of existence of two kinds of carriers assumed
as electrons and holes included in the Drude analysis, one
of γ , which is equal to inverse relaxation time, becomes
very small at low temperatures. They have suggested that
the carriers are related to the extremely large nonsaturating
magnetoresistance, but they have not discussed the existence
of Weyl electrons. The anisotropic σ (ω) spectra of WTe2 in
the ab plane have been reported, and the interband spectra
can be well explained by ab initio band calculations [35]. On
the other hand, even though the optical spectra of 2H-MoTe2
have been reported previously [3–5], the optical spectra of
1T ′-MoTe2 have never been reported to our full knowledge.
In this paper, we report optical spectra of MoTe2 and WTe2,
in which the evidence of Weyl electrons commonly appears in
both materials. As a result, the character of Weyl electrons
can be identiﬁed by the analysis with the combination of two
Drude curves, namely narrow and broad Drude components.
The γ value of the narrow Drude component is strongly
suppressed at low temperatures, which is similar to that of a
type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs, suggesting the existence of Weyl
electrons. In addition, the electron correlation is discussed
using the comparison of the experimentally obtained σ (ω)
spectra with band calculations and calculated σ (ω) spectra.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
High-quality single-crystalline MoTe2 and WTe2 samples
with the size of about 2 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm3 were synthesized
by a self-ﬂux method. One of our samples, WTe2, shows a
large residual resistivity ratio of 1330 and very large mag-
netoresistance with obvious Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation
[36,37]. As-grown surfaces were measured for the optical
reﬂectivity [R(ω)] spectra. Near-normal incident R(ω) spectra
were acquired in a wide photon-energy range of 3 meV–30 eV
to ensure accurate Kramers-Kronig analysis (KKA) [38].
Michelson-type and Martin-Puplett-type rapid-scan Fourier
spectrometers were used at the photon energy ¯hω regions of
8 meV–1.5 eV and 3–20 meV, respectively, with a feedback
positioning system to maintain the overall uncertainty level
less than ±0.5 % in the temperature range of 10–300 K [39].
To obtain the absolute R(ω) values, an in situ evaporation
method was adopted. The obtained temperature-dependent
R(ω) spectra of MoTe2 and WTe2 are shown in Fig. 1. We
could not recognize the structural phase transition of MoTe2 at
about 250 K by the R(ω) spectra. This suggests that the change
of the electronic structure is very small. In the photon energy
range of 1.2–30 eV, the R(ω) spectrum was only measured
at room temperature by using synchrotron radiation, and
connected to the spectra for ¯hω ⩽1.5 eV for the KKA. All
measurements were performed along the ab plane. To obtain
σ (ω) spectra via KKA of R(ω) spectra, the R(ω) spectra were

extrapolated below 3 meV with a Hagen-Rubens function,
and above 30 eV with a free-electron approximation R(ω) ∝
ω−4 [40]. The obtained σ (ω) spectra were compared with
the spectra derived from LDA band-structure calculations
including spin-orbit coupling using the WIEN2K code [41].
Lattice parameters of MoTe2 [12] and WTe2 [42] with 1T ′
crystal structure were adopted.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Comparison with band calculations
Figure 2 indicates the band dispersions and density of
states (DOS) of MoTe2 and WTe2. Both materials are
semimetals because electron and hole bands cross EF at
around the  point. This result is consistent with the pre-
viously reported band calculations [12,43]. Weyl points are
located near the symmetry line of  −X (not shown in
the ﬁgure). In comparison between MoTe2 and WTe2, the
dispersion curves are similar to each other, but both occupied
and unoccupied states of MoTe2 are closer to EF than those of
WTe2, which can be also seen in DOS. A peak at about 0.4 eV
from EF of WTe2 shifts to about 0.2 eV in MoTe2. This causes
an increase in DOS for MoTe2 at around EF, i.e., the carrier
density of MoTe2 is expected to be higher than that of WTe2.
Calculated σ (ω) spectra obtained from band calculations
in Fig. 2(a) in comparison with experimental ones are in-
dicated in Fig. 3. The experimental σ (ω) spectra in the ab
plane have been obtained using nonpolarized light, so the
spectra are compared with the average spectra [(σxx + σyy)/2]
of σxx and σyy along the a and b axes, respectively. It should
be noted that Drude structures appear in the experimental

spectra in the photon energy region below 50 meV due to the
existence of carriers, but it cannot be reproduced by the band
calculations, owing to no information on scattering rate. In
WTe2, the experimental spectrum below the photon energy
of 500 meV has been compared with the DFT-calculated
spectrum by Homes et al. [34], and also with the DFT + U
calculation involving electron correlation (U = 2 eV) [21].
The latter provides better agreement with the experimental
spectrum.
In the present data, even though the calculation without
electron correlation has been performed, the spectrum below
500 meV, especially peaks at around 100 meV, seems to
reproduce the experimental spectrum. However, a peak at
¯hω = 550 meV in MoTe2 and two peaks at 300 and 600 meV
in WTe2 in the experimental spectra cannot be reproduced by
our calculation. There are peaks at 750 meV in MoTe2 and
at 400 and 800 meV in WTe2 in the calculated spectra. If
these peaks in the calculated spectra are regarded to move
to the experimental peaks by a self-energy effect owing to
an electron correlation [44], the renormalization factor z can
be evaluated as ∼0.73 in MoTe2 and ∼0.75 in WTe2, which
are almost consistent with each other. These values are larger
(this means smaller electron correlation) than those of normal
heavy fermion compounds [45], but are similar to that of a
valence ﬂuctuation material YbAl2 (the Kondo temperature
TK ∼2000 K). This is consistent with a relatively smaller
correlation energy U of 2.0 eV [21] than those of other
strongly correlated electron systems [46]. On the other hand,

(marked lines) of MoTe2 (a) and WTe2 (b) compared with
calculated σ (ω) spectra (bold, dashed, and dot-dashed lines)
from the calculated band structures shown in Fig. 2. Because
of the experimental conditions of using nonpolarized light, the
experimental spectra should be compared with the averaged spectra
[(σxx + σyy)/2] of σxx (E ∥a) and σyy (E ∥b).
Frenzel et al. pointed out that the experimental σ (ω) spectra
above the wave number of 5000 cm−1 (∼0.6 eV) in both a and
b axes can be explained by the DFT calculations well [35]. All
of these results suggest the weak electron correlation intensity
in MoTe2 and WTe2.
The overall intensity of the experimental σ (ω) spectrum
of MoTe2 is larger than that of WTe2. This implies that the
DOS of MoTe2 near EF is higher than that of WTe2. This
is consistent with the calculated DOS shown in Fig. 2(b).
In addition, the experimental peaks at 100 and 50 meV in
MoTe2 can be reproduced in the calculation. These peaks can
be regarded to originate from ﬂat structures in the bands near
the  point.
B. Drude analysis
Figure 4 denotes σ (ω) spectra below the photon energy of
500 meV and the direct current [σ (0)] at the corresponding
temperatures. In both MoTe2 and WTe2, σ (0), values are
located at the extrapolation to the lower energy side of the
σ (ω) spectra at temperatures above 130 K; however, σ (0)
values below 40 K become one or more orders higher than the
extrapolation of the σ (ω) spectra. It should be noted that σ (0)
at 10 K (higher than 106 −1cm−1 in both materials [36]) is
located out of range. However, in our accessible lowest energy
range above 3 meV, upturn structures in σ (ω) spectra with
decreasing photon energy have been observed. This suggests
that the upturns are tails of the Drude curves connecting to the
σ (0) values, i.e., new conducting carriers emerge in addition
to the conduction manifesting at high temperatures.

FIG. 4. (a) Temperature-dependent optical conductivity [σ (ω)]
spectra of MoTe2 (a) and WTe2 (b) along the ab plane in the photon
energy (¯hω) region below 500 meV and corresponding direct-current
conductivity [σ (0)], which is consistent with σ (ω = 0). σ (0) at 10 K
is not shown because the value is out of range (>106 −1cm−1) [36].
Considering these features, the σ (ω) spectra have been
ﬁtted by using the combination of two Drude functions as

Here, m denotes the electron rest mass, and σi(0), γi, and

i
are the direct current value, the damping constant of
carriers, and the effective electron number of each component,
respectively.
The ﬁtting results are shown in Fig. 5. In the ﬁtting, the
value of σ1(0) + σ2(0) has been assumed to be equal to σ (0).
In MoTe2, at temperatures higher than 130 K, because the
σ (ω) spectra are almost ﬂat, a single broad Drude function
(namely, D2) can be applied. Below 80 K, however, another
Drude component (namely, D1) with very narrow peak ap-
pears below the photon energy of 10 meV in addition to the
D2 component. The D1 component becomes narrower with
decreasing temperature. In WTe2, the temperature dependence
is similar to that of MoTe2, but the narrow D1 component
appears even at 130–300 K, which is the same result as shown
by Homes et al. [34].
Drude ﬁtting results are shown in Fig. 6. In the two Drude
components, ﬁrstly, let us discuss the behavior of the broad
Drude component D2. In MoTe2, N∗shown in Fig. 6(a)
slightly decreases but is almost constant with decreasing
temperature, but in WTe2, shown in Fig. 6(c), N∗below 20 K
becomes about three times smaller than that above 200 K. The

temperature dependence of N∗originates from the shape of
DOS near EF, i.e., WTe2 has a large change in DOS near EF
in comparison with MoTe2 as seen in Fig. 2(b). Therefore,
the thermal excitation of electrons is considered to be the
origin of the large temperature dependence of σ (ω) of WTe2.
Even though the calculated temperature dependence of the
carrier density using DOS in Fig. 2(b) has similar temperature
dependence to the experimental N∗, the calculated carrier
density increases only about 1.5 times with increasing temper-
ature from 10 to 300 K (not shown here). This inconsistency
suggests that the electron-hole asymmetry in the DOS should
be more accentuated than the calculation shown in Fig. 2(b).
The damping constant γ of D2 in both materials is al-
most ﬂat at temperatures below 80 K and slightly increases
with increasing temperature above 130 K. Since the γ value
originates from the scattering of carriers and the boundary
temperature T ∗of about 100 K is consistent with the Debye
temperature θD = 133.8 ± 0.6 K of WTe2 [47], the temper-
ature dependence of γ of D2 originates from the scatter-
ing by phonons. Below T ∗, γ becomes almost ﬂat, which
suggests the existence of constant scattering by impurities
and/or defects. This result is consistent with the behavior of
other TMDs, i.e., the mobility (μ ∝1/γ ) that has a tender
slope below about 100 K changes to a rapid drop above the

ture. (a) and (b) are the effective carrier density (N∗) and damping

temperature [48]. Therefore, the D2 component is concluded
to originate from the semimetallic bands. It should be noted
that N∗at 10 K evaluated as 1.5 × 1020 cm−3 is consistent
with the sum of the electron and hole carriers obtained from
the size of Fermi surfaces (∼1.35 × 1020 cm−3) [11]. This
also suggests that D2 originates from semimetallic electron
and hole bands and, in addition, the effective mass of carriers
in the semimetallic bands is almost equal to the rest mass of
electrons.
It should be noted that the carrier densities evaluated from
the DOS of MoTe2 and WTe2 in Fig. 2(b) are 1.3 × 1022 cm−3
and 4.3 × 1021 cm−3, respectively, which are one order of
magnitude larger than the experimentally obtained values.
According to the previous quantum oscillation and ARPES
data, however, the experimental Fermi surface size is much
smaller than the calculated one [11,19–22,24]. Therefore, the
evaluated carrier density here is not inconsistent with other
experiments.
Next, the narrow Drude component D1 is discussed. In
both materials, N∗rapidly increases with decreasing temper-
ature below about 100 K. This change cannot be expected
from the shape of DOS. In addition, as pointed out by Homes
et al. [34], one of two semimetallic bands of the compensated
metals is also a candidate. However, since the sizes of the
Fermi surfaces of electron and hole bands are the same as each
other [11] and the dispersions of the bands are also similar
to each other [19], the Drude parameters of the electron and
hole bands should be similar to each other. Therefore, it is
hard to believe that these two show different temperature de-
pendencies, while γ of D1 rapidly decreases with decreasing
temperature below 80 K in contrast to the ﬂat of D2. The
temperature dependence of γ is very similar to that of the
type-I Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP [30]. Therefore, D1
is considered to reﬂect the character of Dirac electrons at
Weyl points of MoTe2 and WTe2. From this point of view,
the rapid increase of N∗with decreasing temperature suggests
that the rapid decrease of the effective mass m∗because of
m∗/m = N0/N∗, where N0 is the actual carrier density. This
suggests the presence of zero mass Dirac electrons.
The temperature dependence of the γ of WTe2 follows
γ ∝T 1.6±0.05 below the temperature of 80 K as shown in
Fig. 6(b). The extrapolation of the γ to zero temperature is
expected to be zero, in other words, the mobility becomes
inﬁnity at 0 K. This suggests that the Weyl points are located
just at EF. It should be noted that the relation of γ ∝T 1.6±0.05
is close to the T 2-law of Weyl semimetals predicted by
Hosur et al. [49]. On the other hand, the γ of MoTe2 has
the temperature dependence of γ ∝T 1.5±0.05 at temperatures
higher than 40 K, which is similar to that of WTe2 below
80 K. The temperature dependence of γ cannot be explained
by the Fermi liquid theory but is similar to those of non-Fermi
liquid materials [50,51]. The temperature order of γ of MoTe2
decreases at temperatures lower than 40 K, which has the
relation of γ ∝T 0.8±0.1. This suggests that the Weyl points
of MoTe2 are located a little away (about 40 K ∼3 meV)
from EF because of a residual γ value due to the existence
of massive electrons and/or the electron correlation inten-
sity increases with approaching EF. An excitonic correlation
might be effected to the origin [26]. The low-energy electron
correlation near the Weyl points might effect the physical
properties such as superconductivity and high thermopower
of MoTe2.
The evidence for Dirac/Weyl semimetal phase in optical
sepctra also appears in the power-law dependence of the inter-
band optical conductivity σ (ω) spectra [52,53]. The power-
law dependence must appear in the energy region of Dirac
linear bands. In the case of MoTe2 and WTe2, it must appear
below 50 meV with reference to band calculations. However,
since the Drude component is dominant in the energy region,
the power-law dependence may not be visible. In other Weyl
semimetals, TaAs and TaP, such power-law behaviors can be
recognized because of weak Drude components.
IV. CONCLUSION
To summarize, the electronic structures of the type-II Weyl
semimetal candidates MoTe2 and WTe2 have been investi-
gated by optical conductivity σ (ω) spectra and LDA band cal-
culations. Obtained σ (ω) spectra can be explained by the band
calculations with the renormalization factor of 0.74 ± 0.01.
Two kinds of Drude components have been observed below
the photon energy of 40 meV. One of the two components
originates from the carriers of semimetallic electron and hole
bands, the other from Dirac carriers at the Weyl points located
at EF that emerge only at low temperatures and the width
of the Drude component become sharper continuously with
decreasing temperature. Therefore, MoTe2 and WTe2 have
two kinds of carriers and are concluded to be type-II Weyl
semimetals.
