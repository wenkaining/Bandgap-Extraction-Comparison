ABSTRACT: We quantify the mechanisms for manganese (Mn) diﬀusion
through graphene in Mn/graphene/Ge (001) and Mn/graphene/GaAs (001)
heterostructures for samples prepared by graphene layer transfer versus graphene
growth directly on the semiconductor substrate. These heterostructures are
important for applications in spintronics; however, challenges in synthesizing
graphene directly on technologically important substrates such as GaAs necessitate
layer transfer and annealing steps, which introduce defects into the graphene. In
situ photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that Mn diﬀusion through
graphene grown directly on a Ge (001) substrate is 1000 times lower than Mn
diﬀusion into samples without graphene (Dgr,direct ∼4 × 10−18 cm2/s, Dno‑gr ∼5 ×
10−15 cm2/s at 500 °C). Transferred graphene on Ge suppresses the Mn in Ge diﬀusion by a factor of 10 compared to no graphene
(Dgr,transfer ∼4 × 10−16 cm2/s). For both transferred and directly grown graphene, the low activation energy (Ea ∼0.1−0.5 eV)
suggests that Mn diﬀusion through graphene occurs primarily at graphene defects. This is further conﬁrmed as the diﬀusivity
prefactor, D0, scales with the defect density of the graphene sheet. Similar diﬀusion barrier performance is found on GaAs substrates;
however, it is not currently possible to grow graphene directly on GaAs. Our results highlight the importance of developing graphene
growth directly on functional substrates to avoid the damage induced by layer transfer and annealing.

1. INTRODUCTION
Graphene is a promising monolayer diﬀusion barrier for
applications such as oxidation resistance,1 metal contacts to
semiconductors,2,3 and semiconductor spintronics.4 Compared
to conventional diﬀusion barriers that typically need to be tens
of nanometers thick, graphene can remain eﬀective as a
diﬀusion barrier down to thicknesses of several atomic layers2
and in select cases a single atomic layer.3 This extreme thinness
is highly attractive for applications where a nearly electronically
transparent interface is desired, for example, spin injection via
tunneling.4 Moreover, recent reports of “remote epitaxy”
suggest that it is possible to synthesize epitaxial ﬁlms through a
monolayer graphene barrier,5−7 opening the possibility of
epitaxial metal/graphene/semiconductor heterostructures that
would otherwise not be stable due to signiﬁcant metal/
semiconductor interdiﬀusion.8
A fundamental challenge, however, is that graphene cannot
be synthesized directly on arbitrary substrates. While graphene
can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Ge and
noble metal surfaces (e.g., Cu, Ag, and Pt), the high synthesis
temperatures and catalytic reactions at the surface currently
preclude growth directly on technologically important
compound semiconductor substrates such as GaAs and InP.
The use of non-native substrates necessitates postsynthesis
large-area graphene layer transfer and annealing, which can
damage the graphene by introducing contaminants such as
oxides and polymer residues and creating tears, wrinkles, and
point defects on the larger length scales relevant to device
applications.9 Previous studies have explored the qualitative
impacts of defects on graphene diﬀusion barriers.2,10,11
However, the speciﬁc eﬀect of the layer transfer process,
elevated temperatures during growth, and a quantiﬁcation of
the diﬀusivity through graphene has not yet been reported.
Here, we quantify the eﬀectiveness of layer-transferred vs
directly grown graphene as a monolayer diﬀusion barrier for
Mn ﬁlms grown on GaAs and Ge substrates. The choice of Mn
on a semiconductor is motivated by applications in spintronics.
For example, the Mn-containing half-metallic ferromagnets
NiMnSb and Co2MnSi are promising materials for spin
injection into GaAs.12,13 Sample structures consisted of a
thin Mn ﬁlm (1.64 × 1016 atoms/cm2, ∼24 Å) grown by
molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on graphene-terminated Ge or
GaAs (001) substrates. We evaluate two graphene prepara-

substrate and (2) transferred graphene that is grown on a
sacriﬁcial Cu foil and then wet transferred to a Ge or GaAs
substrate. We show that the combination of graphene transfer
and pregrowth annealing creates tears and pinholes in the
graphene, as quantiﬁed by Raman spectroscopy and identiﬁed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). In situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements reveal that both transferred and directly
grown graphene suppress diﬀusion into the semiconductor
substrate. Directly grown graphene on Ge signiﬁcantly
outperforms the layer-transferred versions, decreasing the
diﬀusivity at 500 °C 2 orders of magnitude compared to the
layer-transferred version. We quantify the eﬀective diﬀusivities
and activation energies for Mn diﬀusion on graphene-
terminated Ge and GaAs and discuss mechanisms for diﬀusion
with and without tears and pinholes.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2.1. CVD Growth of Graphene on Ge (001) and Cu Foils. We
use two preparations of graphene: graphene that is grown by CVD
directly on Ge (001) and graphene that is grown by CVD on Cu foils
and then layer transferred onto Ge (001) or GaAs (001). For CVD
graphene growth on Ge (001), we followed growth conditions
described in refs 14 and 15. CVD graphene growth on Cu foils was
performed at 1050 °C using ultrahigh-purity CH4, as described in ref
7.
2.2. Graphene Transfer onto Ge (001) and GaAs (001). Our
graphene-transfer process is similar to other polymer-assisted wet
transfers reported in previous works.7,16 The graphene/Cu foils were
cut into 5 by 5 mm pieces and ﬂattened using cleaned glass slides.
Approximately, 300 nm of 495 K C2 PMMA (chlorobenzene base
solvent, 2% by wt., MicroChem) was spin-coated on the graphene/Cu
foil substrate at 2000 rpm for 2 min and left to cure at room
temperature for 24 h. Graphene on the backside of the Cu foil was
removed via reactive ion etching using 90 WO2 plasma at a pressure
of 100 mTorr for 30 s. The Cu foil was then etched by placing the
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/graphene/Cu foil stack on the
surface of an etch solution containing 1-part ammonium persulfate
(APS-100, Transene) and 3-parts H2O. After 16 h of etching at room
temperature, the ﬂoating PMMA/graphene membrane was scooped
up using a clean glass slide and sequentially transferred into ﬁve 5 min
water baths to rinse the etch residuals. Prior to scooping the graphene
with the GaAs (001) substrate, the native oxide is etched in a 10%
HCl bath for 30 s. GaAs is then rinsed in isopropanol and nitrogen-
dried. Prior to scooping with the Ge (001) substrate, the native oxide
is etched in a hot (90 °C) reverse-osmosis (RO) water bath for 15
min. Immediately after the etching process, the substrate is used to

Bscoop the PMMA/graphene membrane from the ﬁnal water bath. To
remove water at the graphene/substrate interface, samples were baked
in air at 50 °C for 5 min and then slowly ramped to 150 °C and baked
for another 10 min. PMMA was dissolved by submerging the sample
in an acetone bath at 80 °C for 3 h. Samples are then rinsed in
isopropanol and dried with nitrogen.
2.3. Graphene Surface Preparation and Manganese Film
Growth. Bare Ge substrates were sequentially degreased for 15 min
in acetone and 15 min in isopropanol baths and then etched in RO
water at 90 °C for 30 min. No solvent treatments were performed to
the bare GaAs substrates. All samples were indium-bonded to a
molybdenum sample holder to ensure good thermal contact. Samples
were outgassed in a high-vacuum load lock (p < 5 × 10−8 Torr) for at
least 1 h at 150 °C prior to transferring into the ultrahigh-vacuum
MBE chamber (p < 5 × 10−10 Torr).
In the MBE chamber, the graphene-terminated samples were
further outgassed at ∼300 °C to remove residual organic
contaminants. Select graphene samples were characterized by SEM,
AFM, and Raman spectroscopy after the ∼300 °C outgas (labeled as
“preanneal” in Figure 1). Following the ∼300 °C outgas, graphene
samples were annealed at roughly 600 °C to remove native oxides.
Removal of surface oxides was conﬁrmed via reﬂection high-energy
electron diﬀraction. For the bare GaAs substrate, a thick GaAs buﬀer
layer was grown to smoothen the surface before Mn growth. No
buﬀer layers were grown on the other samples.
Thin Mn ﬁlms (1.64 × 1016 atoms/cm2) were grown at room
temperature using an elemental eﬀusion cell. The thickness was
measured using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance that has been
calibrated through ex situ Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy.
2.4. In Situ Photoemission. Immediately following growth,
samples were transferred through an ultrahigh-vacuum manifold (p <
5 × 10−9 Torr) to a connected photoemission spectroscopy chamber.
XPS measurements were conducted using a nonmonochromated
Omicron DAR-400 dual-anode X-ray source (Al Kα, hν = 1486.6 eV)
and an Omicron EA125 hemispherical analyzer. The total energy
resolution of the analyzer in the experimental conﬁguration was
measured to be 1.08 eV using an Au standard. The photoemission
chamber pressure was maintained at <3 × 10−10 Torr during the
measurements.
At each annealing step, the samples were ramped from room
temperature to the desired anneal setpoint temperature over 5 min.
The sample was held at a temperature of ±10 °C for 5 min and then
rapidly cooled to room temperature. Sample temperature was
measured by a thermocouple attached to the sample manipulator,
roughly 1 cm away from the sample. The thermocouple was calibrated
using the melting point of indium and the arsenic desorption
temperature of As-capped GaAs. The sample was transferred
immediately following the cool down back into the photoemission
stage before beginning the next XPS measurement.
2.5. Raman Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Micros-
copy. Graphene was characterized using ﬁeld-emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, (Zeiss LEO 1530 Gemini). Raman
spectroscopy was performed using a 532 nm wavelength laser (Horiba
LabRAM HR Evolution Spectrometer). The laser power is ﬁxed at 10
mW, and a 300 gr/mm diﬀraction grating is used for every scan. This
results in a spectral resolution of 2.5 cm−1 and a spatial resolution of
0.5 μm. Each scan presented is an average spectrum consisting of 400
scans over a representative 100 μm2 area of the graphene surface.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 illustrates the diﬀerences between the directly grown
graphene versus graphene that has been layer transferred onto
Ge. We ﬁrst examine the samples after light outgassing at 300
°C to remove solvents and adsorbates but before full annealing
(labeled as “preanneal”, Figure 1). For directly grown graphene
on Ge, the primary feature observed by SEM is faceting of the
Ge (001) surface (Figure 1a, left), as has been observed
previously.17 In contrast, the layer-transferred graphene on Ge

Cdisplays a network of grain boundaries and wrinkles as labeled
by the yellow arrows (Figure 1b, left). The grain boundaries
originate from graphene growth on polycrystalline Cu foils
(Supporting Information, Figure S1). AFM measurements
conﬁrm the grain boundaries and wrinkles for transferred
graphene (Figure S2b, left). Neither layer transferred nor
directly grown graphene shows obvious signs of holes or tears
prior to annealing in SEM or AFM measurements. Raman
spectroscopy (Figure 1d) shows that the ID/IG integrated
intensity ratios for directly grown and layer-transferred
graphene on Ge before annealing are similar (0.3 and 0.5,
respectively), indicative of a similar defect density.18,19 Layer-
transferred graphene on GaAs (001) exhibits a qualitatively
similar surface morphology and Raman spectra as the graphene
transferred onto Ge (001) (Figure 1c, left).
After annealing in ultrahigh vacuum at 600 °C, which is
necessary to remove substrate native oxides prior to ﬁlm
deposition,20,21 we observe stark contrast between the two
diﬀerent graphene preparations. For directly grown graphene
on Ge, our Raman, SEM, and AFM measurements display
negligible diﬀerences before and after annealing (Figure 1a,
right). AFM measurements reveal faint wrinkles in the
graphene layer formed after annealing (Supporting Informa-
tion, Figure S2) but no obvious formation of tears (Figure 1a)
and negligible changes in the Raman ID/IG ratio (Figure 1d,
red curves). In contrast, for layer-transferred graphene, our
SEM and AFM measurements reveal holes and tears that
appear to originate at grain boundaries [green arrows in Figure
1b (right) and Supporting Information, Figure S2]. This
increase in defect density is further conﬁrmed through Raman
spectroscopy, where we observe a dramatic increase in the
Raman ID/IG ratio for transferred graphene after annealing
(Figure 1d, blue curves), indicating the formation of tears and
other defects. We observe a similar increase in the tear density
and Raman ID/IG ratio for transferred graphene on GaAs after
annealing (Figure 1c).
We hypothesize that the anneal-induced tears are created by
the desorption of native oxides that are trapped between the
substrate and layer-transferred graphene. Previous in situ XPS
measurements demonstrate that layer-transferred graphene on
III−V substrates contains oxides trapped at the graphene/III−
V interface.22 Desorption of these interfacial oxides creates
pinholes in the graphene. We expect transferred graphene/Ge
to behave similarly. In contrast, graphene that is directly grown
on Ge does not have these interfacial contaminants and thus
does not show an increased defect density after annealing.
We now measure the diﬀusion barrier performance for Mn
thin ﬁlms grown on the above graphene-terminated samples.
After loading the graphene/Ge samples into vacuum and
annealing at 600 C, Mn thin ﬁlms (1.64 × 1016 atoms/cm2,
∼24 Å) were grown by MBE at room temperature. After
growth, samples were transferred via an ultrahigh vacuum
manifold to a connected XPS chamber. In this way, we
measure clean the XPS spectra of samples that have not been
exposed to air. Further details are described in the
Experimental Section.
Figure 2c presents in situ photoemission spectra tracking the
evolution of the Mn surface composition for Mn ﬁlms grown
on Ge substrates, with and without a graphene barrier. Each
sample was subjected to a series of anneal steps at increasing
temperature up to 500 °C. To eliminate variations in sample
alignment, all spectra are normalized to the integrated Ge 3p
core-level intensity. For the Mn ﬁlm grown directly on Ge
(black curves), with increasing anneal temperature, the
intensity of the Mn 2p rapidly decreases, corresponding to a
decrease in the relative surface Mn composition. For Mn on
transferred graphene (blue curves) and on directly grown
graphene (red curves), the Mn 2p core-level decay is
suppressed.
To compare the relative changes in surface Mn concen-
tration, we ﬁt the Mn 2p and Ge 3p core levels to Doniach−
Sunjic23 and Voigt lineshapes, respectively, and plot the
relative change in Mn/Ge intensity ratio, R

temperature T and the denominator with subscript 0 refers to
the Mn 2p/Ge 3p intensity ratio as-grown, before additional
annealing. This normalization procedure cancels out the
instrumental sensitivity, alignment, and photoemission cross
section.
We ﬁnd that the directly grown graphene performs best as a
diﬀusion barrier, with RMn decreasing to only 0.7 after
annealing up to 500 °C, compared to RMn = 0.05 for the
sample without graphene. Transferred graphene also sup-
presses interdiﬀusion compared to the bare substrate. For the
sample without graphene, there is a distinct onset of
interdiﬀusion around 150 °C, at which point RMn rapidly
decreases. There is no distinct onset for the samples with
graphene barriers. Together, these results demonstrate that
both transferred and directly grown graphene are eﬀective
solid-state diﬀusion barriers for Mn in Ge and that directly
grown graphene is the most eﬀective.
We next estimate the temperature-dependent diﬀusion
length based on the relative changes in the Mn 2p/Ge 3p
intensity ratio, RMn. For a very thin Mn ﬁlm on a semi-inﬁnite
substrate, the solution to the diﬀusion equation is a half

where λ is the diﬀusion length and ntotal = 1.64 × 1016 atoms/
cm2 is the total areal density of Mn deposited. We deﬁne the
as-deposited initial condition such that the Mn concentration
at the surface (z = 0) is equal to the density of pure Mn, that is,
cMn(0, λ0) = c0 = 8.2 × 1022 atoms/cm3. This yields an initial
diﬀusion length of λ0 = 11 Å. For simplicity, we let the Ge
composition proﬁle be cGe(z) = c0 −cMn(z), assuming that
pure Mn, pure Ge, and the diﬀused Mn−Ge have
approximately the same atomic densities and layer spacings.
From these composition proﬁles, we calculate the expected
intensity ratios for Mn 2p and Ge 3p as a function of the
diﬀusion length. The intensity of the core level x is given by

measured RMn is uniquely deﬁned by the diﬀusion length λ
after each sequential anneal.
Figure 2e shows the estimated diﬀusion length, obtained by
ﬁtting the experimentally measured RMn to the calculated
intensity ratios from eqs 1 and 2. We ﬁnd that compared to the
bare Ge substrate, directly grown graphene on Ge suppresses
the diﬀusion length by a factor of just under 11 and layer-
transferred graphene suppresses the diﬀusion length by a factor
of 3.5 at a temperature of 500 °C.
In situ photoemission measurements for Mn on GaAs
substrates reveal the same behavior as the samples on Ge
(Figure 3). For the Mn directly grown on GaAs (Figure 3a,
black curves), in the as-grown spectrum, we observe a
secondary component at higher binding energy, indicative of
reactions or secondary phases between Mn and GaAs. This
reacted component grows with increased annealing. We
attribute these secondary components to the formation of
Mn2As and MnGa phases, as has been observed previously at
Mn/GaAs interfaces without graphene.25 Comparison of the
normalized Mn 2p intensity RMn and the estimated diﬀusion
length reveals that similar to Ge, transferred graphene
suppresses interdiﬀusion into GaAs.
We now use the diﬀusion length to estimate the diﬀusivity
via λ2 = Dt. Since each sample is subjected to a series of
anneals at increasing temperature, we approximate the
cumulative diﬀusion length squared after N anneal steps as a

Ecurve). A similar behavior is observed for transferred
graphene/GaAs compared to that for bare GaAs. To
benchmark the accuracy of our method, we ﬁnd that our
experimentally determined diﬀusivities for Mn on bare GaAs
(Figure 4b, ﬁlled black circles) are in good agreement with
previous experiments (open black circles).26−28
We now discuss the mechanisms for Mn diﬀusion based on
the experimentally determined Ea and D0. Our experimentally
determined activation energy of 0.8 eV for Mn diﬀusing into
bare GaAs and Ge agrees well with previous experiments and
DFT calculations for Mn interstitial diﬀusion into GaAs (0.7−
0.8 eV29). Substitutional diﬀusion is expected to exhibit a
higher activation energy of 2−3 eV.30
In comparison, Ea for Mn diﬀusion into graphene-
terminated substrates is considerably lower: 0.1 eV for directly
grown graphene on Ge and 0.2−0.5 eV for transferred
graphene on GaAs and Ge. We immediately rule out transverse
diﬀusion through pristine graphene since diﬀusion through
graphene in the absence of defects is expected to have a very
large activation energy barrier of Ea ∼12 eV.31 This is because
the eﬀective pore size of graphene is small (∼0.7 Å radius of a
carbon ring, less than half the radius of a Mn atom). Therefore,
we expect that Mn diﬀusion through graphene occurs primarily
through defect-mediated processes.
The range of measured activation energies suggests that
several mechanisms for Mn diﬀusion through graphene defects
may be possible. At high temperatures (T > 200 °C or 1000/T
< 2.1 K−1), we speculate that our extracted Ea is lower on
graphene-terminated substrates than on bare substrates due to
reactions being catalyzed at graphene defects since graphene
defects are known to be chemically active.2,32 At this point, we
do not have suﬃcient data to determine the mechanisms of
diﬀusion at lower temperatures, T < 200 °C (or 1000/T > 2.1
K−1; Figure 4, dotted lines). The range of measured activation
energies may also reﬂect a convolution of surface and bulk
diﬀusion, in which Mn adatoms ﬁrst diﬀuse laterally to reactive
pinhole sites before diﬀusing into the substrate (Figure 4c).
First-principles calculations suggest that the activation energy
for the lateral diﬀusion of Mn on graphene is 60 meV33 and Cu
on graphene is 10−20 meV,34 similar to the activation energies
extracted from our photoemission measurements (Table 1).
More detailed experiments with lateral and depth resolution, at
a broader range of temperatures, are needed to fully
understand the detailed diﬀusion mechanisms through
graphene.
While a low activation energy barrier favors a large
diﬀusivity, the origin of the dramatic decrease of diﬀusivity
for graphene-terminated samples is the reduction of the
prefactor D0. We interpret D0 to scale as an attempt rate for
diﬀusion. For Mn on bare GaAs and Ge substrates, the attempt
rates of 10−11 to 10−10 cm2/s are high because there are many
available sites for interstitial diﬀusion into the substrate. On the
other hand, attempt rates are lower on the graphene-
terminated substrates because Mn diﬀusion through graphene
requires a defect in the graphene. This rate is higher for layer-
transferred graphene (10−17 to 10−13 cm2/s) than that for
directly grown graphene (10−17 cm2/s) since the layer-
transferred graphene has a higher defect density as quantiﬁed
by our Raman, SEM, and AFM measurements (Figures 1 and
Supporting Information, S-2). Note that ﬁlm/substrate
interactions35 and doping36 can modify Raman intensity
ratios;37 therefore, it is diﬃcult to make direct comparisons
of gr/Ge and gr/GaAs defect densities based on the ID/IG ratio
(Figure 1d). Further experiments are required to correlate
speciﬁc defect types (e.g., tears, wrinkles, pinholes, and
vacancies) with speciﬁc values of the diﬀusivity.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that layer-transferred and directly grown
graphene suppresses Mn diﬀusion into semiconductor
substrates. The directly grown graphene displays superior
diﬀusion barrier performance due to a lower defect density, as
quantiﬁed by Raman spectroscopy and SEM after annealing
but before Mn ﬁlm growth. Translating these performance
enhancements to functional substrates at the wafer scale will
require directly grown graphene synthesis approaches on the
substrate of interest. For example, CVD approaches using small
molecules,38 activated precursors,39 or plasma-enhanced CVD
processes40−42 show promise for reducing the graphene
synthesis temperature and may be a route for graphene growth
directly on GaAs and other technologically important
compound semiconductors.
