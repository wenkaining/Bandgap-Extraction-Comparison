lobal warming and the decreasing availability of fossil fuels 
urge today’s society to transition to more sustainable energy 
sources. While there is enough solar and wind power to sat-
isfy our needs in terms of total energy1,2, the available power fluc-
tuates strongly and requires intermediate and long-term storage3,4. 
One viable option is storage of the intermittent electrical energy in 
the form of chemical fuels such as hydrogen (power-to-X). Clean 
hydrogen can be produced by alkaline electrolysers, which require 
constant and high current densities for stable operation5. In acidic 
environments, more powerful and flexible proton exchange mem-
brane electrolysers can be employed that allow for coupling with 
fluctuating energy sources such as wind and solar6,7. As the most 
widely used electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction 
(HER) is still platinum—an expensive and scarce metal that is also 
poisoned easily—research into alternative or modified highly effi-
cient and stable electrocatalysts under various conditions has been 
identified as a key goal in energy science8–10.
Strain effects have been discussed to be at the heart of enhanced 
intrinsic activities towards several catalytic reactions including the 
HER, as predicted and observed for example in Pd overlayers11–13. 
More recently, the scope of this concept has been widened and the 
direct strain control in substrate-induced strain effects or in core–
shell particles has been effectively used for the HER, as well as the 
oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction14–19.
Here, we report the time evolution of the electrocatalytic activity 
of the ABO2 delafossites PdCrO2, PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 for the HER 
in acidic medium, and show how inherent structural strain can be 
used to enhance the operando catalytic efficiency. Since their dis-
covery and the observation of their unusually high and anisotropic 
conductivity in 197120–22, these oxides have attracted renewed inter-
est recently for their unusual electronic properties23 and anisotropic 
thermopower24 and, most recently, for the discovery of hydrody-
namic electron flow occurring in nanostructured PdCoO2
25.
A common feature of the metallic Pd- and Pt-based delafossites 
is an inherently expanded hexagonal metal sublattice with extended 
nearest-neighbour distances on the A -site compared with the pure 
metals (2.830 Å in PdCoO2 and 2.923 Å in PdCrO2 versus 2.751 Å 
in face-centred cubic (fcc) Pd(111); and 2.823 Å in PtCoO2 versus 
2.775 Å in metallic Pt(111))20–23. This sublattice is separated by a 
layer of edge-sharing MO6 (M = Co, Cr) octahedra (see Fig. 1a), 
which gives rise to anisotropic transport properties. So far, these and 
other delafossite oxides have been reported as highly efficient elec-
trocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media26,27. 
Furthermore, copper- and silver-based delafossites have been 
reported as photocathodes due to their large band gap28–31. Apart 
from AgRhO2 and CuCrO2, the stability of these systems appears to 
be limited to basic, neutral or non-reductive conditions32,33.
In this work, we make use of the intrinsically strained metal sub-
lattices and study the hydrogen evolution activity of the delafossite 
oxides PdMO2 (M = Cr, Co) and PtCoO2, investigating the influence 
of strain on catalytic activity. For PdCoO2, our long-term studies 
reveal a gradual enhancement of the already excellent water reduc-
tion activity of the bulk material over time, putting the electrocata-
lytic activity of operando-modified PdCoO2 on par with that of the 
top-of-the-class HER electrocatalyst in acidic medium—platinum. 
We elucidate how the charge transfer properties and high specific 
activity per surface area evolve, and we attribute the observed 
changes to the strain-induced stabilization of operando-formed,

The rational design of hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts that can compete with platinum is an outstanding chal-
lenge in the process of designing viable power-to-gas technologies. Here, we introduce delafossites as a family of hydrogen 
evolution reaction electrocatalysts in acidic media. We show that, in PdCoO2, the inherently strained Pd metal sublattice acts 
as a pseudomorphic template for the growth of a tensile-strained Pd-rich capping layer under reductive conditions. The sur-
face modification ranges up to 400 nm and continuously improves the electrocatalytic activity by simultaneously increasing 
the exchange current density and by reducing the Tafel slope down to 38 mV dec−1, leading to overpotentials η10 < 15 mV. The 
improved activity is attributed to the operando stabilization of a β-PdHx phase with enhanced surface catalytic properties with 
respect to pure or nanostructured palladium. These findings illustrate how operando-induced electrodissolution can be used as 
a top-down design concept through the strain-stabilized formation of catalytically active phases.

catalytically highly active β-palladium hydride (PdHx; x = ~0.62–
0.67)34. Together with an apparent increase in exchange current 
density, these effects lead to a drastically reduced overpotential at 
10 mA cm−2
geo (η10) of <15 mV and a Tafel slope of 30–40 mV dec−1, 
enabling stable operation at current densities of 100 mA cm−2
geo with 
<100 mV of applied (uncorrected) potential.
Results
Electrochemical characterization. Polycrystalline powders of the 
delafossites PdCrO2, PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 were prepared accord-
ing to reported procedures (see Methods for details). The crystal 
structure of the isostructural compounds (space group: R3m
I
) was 
confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements (see 
Supplementary Fig. 1) and is displayed schematically for PdCoO2 
in Fig. 1a20,35. The crystallite sizes were in the range 1–3 µm for 
PdCrO2, 10–30 µm for PtCoO2 and up to 1 mm for PdCoO2, as 
evidenced by electron microscopy (see Fig. 2). These micro-
crystals were subsequently pressed into a carbon paste electrode  
(see Methods for details) to study their activity towards HER in 
acidic media. The analysis was performed in hydrogen-saturated 
1 M H2SO4 by means of cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiom-
etry and amperometry. The polarization curves in Fig. 1b–d show 
the uncorrected cathodic currents per geometric surface area  
(in mA cm−2
geo) for the first 1,000 cycles on all three materials, which 
all increased in efficiency in different ways. After correcting for the 
series resistance losses (current × resistance (IR) drop) extracted 
from impedance measurements before the respective cycles,  
the CVs can be fitted to the following Tafel equation:
η ¼ b log½j=j0
ð1Þ
where η is the overpotential with respect to the reversible hydro-
gen electrode (RHE), b is the Tafel slope (in mV dec−1), which pro-
vides insight into the electrocatalytic processes occurring on the 
surface, j is the current density and j0 is the exchange current den-
sity, which is a measure of the intrinsic activity per surface area36.
The activity of all delafossites was very high, requiring an over-
potential η10 of far less than 100 mV for all systems. PdCrO2 initially 
required an overpotential η10 of approximately 50 mV (Fig. 1b,e). 
Subsequently, the current density decreased and stabilized with 
increasing cycle number. PdCoO2 (Fig. 1c,e) initially also yielded an 
overpotential η10 of 50 mV versus the RHE for a similar loading, and 
kept improving during the first 1,000 cycles down to 12 ± 3 mV. In 
contrast, PtCoO2 initially showed a lower activity than the Pd-based 
materials and quickly improved towards comparable activities of 
PdCoO2 within 30–100 cycles. Afterwards, it stabilized at an over-
potential η10 of around 30–35 mV. Remarkably, the overpotentials of 
all of the materials were very low after some initial cycles, and the 
Co-based delafossites outperformed most catalysts, particularly all 
oxides, after just 30 cycles (η10 < 40 mV) in acidic media37–40.
To better understand the curious evolution of the overpoten-
tial over time, we discriminat between the effects arising from the 
intrinsic activity and those induced operando (that is, during the 
electrocatalytic process). In the first cycles, the cathodic currents 
were influenced by surface activation or hydrogen sorption, as is 
well known for Pt and Pd, respectively41,42. This was clearly visible 
in the first cycle of PdCrO2 (Fig. 1b), where the apparent high activ-
ity occurred already at the RHE potential before hydrogen satura-
tion at the surface was achieved. In the range of 10–1,000 cycles, 
the catalytic mechanism on the surface evolved with increasing 
cycle number and the currents tended to stabilize. Interestingly, 
the overpotential was also modified by the catalytic process itself, 
as reflected by the decreasing Tafel slopes for the Co-based mate-
rials (Fig. 1f). The values between 70 and 38 mV dec−1 suggest a 
mixture between a reaction rate limited by the discharge reaction 
of protons at the surface (128 mV dec−1; Volmer mechanism) and 
the Volmer–Tafel mechanism (38 mV dec−1), in which the recombi-
nation of adsorbed hydrogen is rate determining, as was observed 
after 1,000 cycles of PdCoO2. Pure Pd metal, which has a high Tafel 
slope of >100 mV dec−1 for current densities >1 mA cm−2, is limited 
by the Volmer mechanism, in contrast with the delafossites pre-
sented herein (see Supplementary Fig. 2)36,43,44. The observed evolu-
tion of the activity described by η10 in the delafossite oxides further 
appeared to be related to the activity of the catalysts per surface 
area, j0 (Fig. 1g), which changed as a function of time and paral-
leled the trends observed for the overpotentials shown in Fig. 1e.  
While j0 tended to slightly decrease for PdCrO2, it increased for 
both Co-containing materials, indicating an effective increase in the

intrinsic activity or catalytically active area, or both. The values for j0 
evolving with time were all ~1 mA cm−2 and are thus among the high-
est reported to date. For PdCoO2, a j0 value of up to 5.0 ± 1.2 mA cm−2 
is even superior to those observed for both bulk Pt and Pd (2.3 
and 0.9 mA cm−2, respectively; see Supplementary Fig. 2)36,37,45. 
To exclude possible artificial enhancement effects arising from metal 
nanoparticle redeposition from the counter electrode, additional 
reference experiments were performed on PdCoO2. Despite the use 
of a potentially poisoning C-rod counter electrode, these measure-
ments showed very similar development of the Tafel parameters  
(see Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 1).
To obtain an estimate of the real surface area, impedance 
measurements were performed to extract the double-layer 
capacitance, CDL (which is proportional to the electrochemical 
surface area (ECSA)), and pseudocapacitive contribution, CP (see 
Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 2). Since no refer-
ences for the operando-modified delafossites are available, due to 
their modified surface properties, the same capacitive response fac-
tors as for bulk Pd or Pt were assumed (see Supplementary Note 2). 
We then obtained ECSA-normalized j0,ECSA values of 0.14 mA cm−2 
for PdCrO2 and 0.20 mA cm−2 for PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 after 300 
cycles (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for details). These values are close 
to those of dealloyed Pd nanoparticles without normalization for 
real surface area (0.18 mA cm−2)46, and to the surface-normalized 
values of 0.14 and 0.22 mA cm−2 reported for tensile-strained Pd 
grown on Au or rough Pd surfaces, respectively47,48.
To provide insights into the origin of the currents observed 
in the electrocatalytic experiments, the evolution of hydrogen 
was investigated close to the surface by scanning electrochemi-
cal microscopy (SECM) measurements on PdCoO2 single crystals 
operando (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 3 for 
details). Although no site dependence could be mapped due to a tip-
limited resolution >10 µm, the probing electrode feedback clearly 
showed the presence of hydrogen near the sample surface (~10 µm) 
when the sample was held at different cathodic sample potentials 
under weakly acidic conditions. Cyclic voltammograms reflecting 
the reductive SECM tip HER current for different sample potentials 
showed a decrease when the PdCoO2 sample HER current became 
competitive, and an increase in the hydrogen oxidation current at 
oxidative tip potentials. Temporally, an increase in hydrogen pro-
duction at the sample could be evidenced by increasing proton 
reduction currents at the tip. This highlights the fact that pris-
tine samples are HER active and improve over time, even without 
cycling. Furthermore, a comparison of the charge passed through a 
pre-aged PdCoO2 single crystal (>1,000 cycles), referenced to a Pt 
wire, yielded stable Faradaic efficiencies towards hydrogen evolu-
tion of >90%. In contrast, a pure Pd wire had a Faradaic efficiency 
of only 6%, probably due to large amounts of H2 being incorpo-
rated into the Pd lattice, even after long coulometric measurements  
(see Supplementary Fig. 6)44,45.
Surface modification analysis. Next, to understand the origin of 
the observed increase in catalytic activity over time, the modifica-
tions on the surface of the delafossites were tracked by analysis of 
the electrolyte composition, by means of inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectrometry, after the electrocatalytic experi-
ments (see Supplementary Table 1). Almost no detectable amounts 
of Cr in the electrolyte suggested high stability of this element in the 
PdCrO2 surface (<0.08 at% of the Cr amount present in the elec-
trode), while PtCoO2 showed small amounts of Co in the electro-
lyte, corresponding to 0.24 ± 0.03 at% of the electrode element. No 
dissolved Pt was evidenced in all cases. In contrast, PdCoO2 showed 
increased amounts of Co in the electrolyte, indicating much faster 
dissolution of Co, which progressed at a rate two orders of magni-
tude faster than Cr dissolution49. After 1,000 cycles, 9.35 ± 0.9 at.% 
of the Co had leached out from PdCoO2.
Consequently, we expected the formation of a Pd-rich surface 
layer on PdCoO2, which would be approximately 310 nm thick after 
1,000 cycles (see Supplementary Note 4 for details). Indeed, direct 
evidence of surface transformation was obtained by optical micros-
copy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the surfaces of 
the delafossites after catalysis. While PdCrO2 did not show any 
obvious signs of corrosion (Fig. 2a,b), the surface of PtCoO2 was 
slightly modified, which was elucidated by a slight roughening and 
accumulation of heavier elements, as shown by the back-scattered 
electron detector image (Fig. 2c,d versus Fig. 2e,f). In contrast, the 
surface of PdCoO2 was strongly modified, as shown in Fig. 2g–l 
and mirrored by the significant Co dissolution and stronger change

in catalytic properties. Inspection under an optical microscope  
(Fig. 2g,h) revealed large-area surface modification and roughen-
ing. A more detailed SEM analysis of the surface (Fig. 2i versus 
Fig. 2j) showed the formation of a continuous capping layer with a 
higher concentration of heavy elements than the pristine, underly-
ing material. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps on 
the modified surface further underlined the enrichment of Pd in 
this topmost capping layer. The formation of cracks and nanoparti-
cles within the capping layer (Fig. 2j–l) suggested a release of strain 
still present in the remaining capping structure after Co and O were 
dissolved near the surface (vide infra). These cracks could also be 
related to potential dependent hydrogen loading and unloading 
into the catalysts during electrocatalytic cycling, which can result 
in dynamically modified lattice parameters50. Also, small amounts 
of Pd were found in the electrolyte after catalysis, which could  
be explained by partial detachment of the strained capping layer 
(see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 5)50.
To further investigate the surface modification, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the valence state of 
the respective components of all three materials before and after 
catalysis, as shown in Fig. 3. A detailed discussion including sur-
vey spectra and peak lists can be found in Supplementary Note 6, 
Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 2–5. In brief, the 
main elemental lines of all pristine delafossites corresponded well 
to the literature values. In the oxygen spectra (Fig. 3c,f,i), an O 1s 
signal at 531–532 eV was attributed to surface-adsorbed oxygen. 
After catalysis, the amplitude of the delafossite M–O interaction 
peak at 529 eV was slightly lowered relative to the surface O 1s 
peak in PdCrO2 (Fig. 3c), suggesting somewhat decreasing bind-
ing of Pd and Cr to O at the surface. For PdCoO2 (Fig. 3d–f) and 
PtCoO2 (Fig. 3g–i), the Co and M–O 1s signals completely disap-
peared after catalysis, with slightly slower kinetics for PtCoO2 (see 
Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10), underlining the formation of a Pd(0) 
or Pt(0) layer on the surface during catalysis, in agreement with 
the inductively coupled plasma measurements on Co dissolution. 
Summarizing these results, we can conclude that PdCrO2 remained 
largely unchanged over the cycling experiments, while PtCoO2 and 
PdCoO2 gradually lost Co and were eventually reduced, forming a 
metallic capping layer of the respective noble metal.
Capping structure and strain analysis. Having identified the 
nature of the surface corrosion process as the reductive formation 
of a Pd-rich capping layer on PdCoO2, we turned to the question 
of why this process led to the observed exceptionally high activ-
ity towards HER. To this end, we first used scanning transmis-
sion electron microscopy (STEM) to characterize the structure 
and elemental composition of the pre- and post-catalysis samples 
at high spatial resolution. STEM lamellae were prepared from a

PdCoO2 single crystal after short (5 min) and long (hours) chro-
noamperometric aging at −100 mV versus the RHE (see Fig. 2c–e 
and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 11), as well as after 100 and 1,000 
cycles (see Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13), which all led to the 
formation of a capping layer with increasing thickness. A cross-
sectioned lamella of a single crystal aged 5 min contained both 
the capping layer and the underlying material, as shown in Fig. 4 
(see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 5 for a lamella 
prepared after hours of aging, and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 
for 100 and 1,000 cycles). The Pd capping layer was ~30 nm thick 
and consisted of Pd nanocrystals of 2–10 nm in size (Fig. 4a–d). 
Elemental analysis of the capping layer by EDS spectrum imag-
ing51 showed that the cap consisted primarily of Pd (Fig. 4e), while 
the Co concentration was below the detection limit (<2%). O was 
only observed at the surface of the Pd capping layer. The concen-
tration profiles are summarized in the display element to the right 
of Fig. 4f. As shown in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13, 
the Pd fcc capping layer grew directly on the PdCoO2 surface, in 
direct contact with the electrolyte. There was a sharp transition 
between the PdCoO2 crystal and the Pd cap (Fig. 4b). The atomic-
resolution STEM high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image 
of PdCoO2 in Fig. 4c is overlaid by the crystal structure along the 
[11–20] zone axis. We observed a matched orientation of the whole 
capping volume with respect to the PdCoO2 substrate, suggesting 
substrate-templated directional growth of Pd(111) in the c direc-
tion of the bulk PdCoO2 (normal to the hexagonal Pd sublattice). 
Within the cap structure, twin variants of Pd nanocrystals were 
observed (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs. 9–11). Fast Fourier 
transformations of the respective cap (Pd fcc) and bulk (PdCoO2) 
regions revealed only a few degrees tilt or no tilt between Pd(111) 
and PdCoO2(0003), as shown in Supplementary Figs. 11–13. This 
lends further evidence that the capping layer grows via leaching of 
Co and O from the bulk material, while the hexagonal Pd lattice 
in PdCoO2 evolves into an fcc Pd lattice with minimal structural 
reorganization, as illustrated in Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 12a.  
To derive the lattice parameter of the Pd nanocrystals, STEM 
micrographs were calibrated using the lattice parameters of PdCoO2 
from XRD measurements. Compared with the sharp reflections of 
PdCoO2, Pd reflections were broader along the radial and azimuthal 
axes, corresponding to a broader range of strain and rotation among 
Pd nanocrystals. Analysis of all Pd {111} reflections evidenced an 
isotropic lattice parameter of 3.98 Å on average, which proved that 
the Pd fcc capping layer showed isotropic tensile strain, even for 
both twin variants (Supplementary Fig. 13). Further comparison 
with thicker capping layers, where the strain states over larger areas 
(400 × 200 nm2) were studied for meaningful statistical analysis, 
showed a slightly smaller but comparable isotropic lattice parameter 
of 3.95 Å on average for 70- and 400-nm-thick lamella, respectively, 
in both the surface and PdCoO2-bulk-near parts (Supplementary 
Figs. 12 and 13), with a broad distribution of strain values ranging 
from 0–4% (3.86–4.05 Å) at full width at half-maximum (FWHM) 
(see Supplementary Table 6). Regardless of the progression of elec-
trochemical etching and subsequent increase in the Pd capping 
layer thickness, the average lattice parameters still remained larger 
than those of bulk Pd crystals (3.89 Å)52 or those reported for Pd 
nanoparticles of a similar size (approximately 10 nm) that showed 
no lattice dilatation (see also Supplementary Fig. 14)53. Only below 
3 nm has a comparable lattice parameter been reported for pure Pd 
nanoparticles deposited on carbon54. A lattice constant of 3.98 Å in 
the capping layer corresponds to Pd nearest-neighbour distances of 
2.815 Å in the Pd fcc structure, which is very close to 2.83 Å in the 
Pd sublattice of PdCoO2 and significantly differs from unstrained 
Pd (2.75 Å). This further underlines the relevance of lattice strain in 
the substrate material, PdCoO2, which is transduced to the strained 
capping layer.
The observations made on PdCoO2 in Fig. 4 agree with induc-
tively coupled plasma measurements of dissolved Co in the electro-
lyte and the XPS data (Fig. 3) but further suggest that the continuous 
dissolution of Co and O creates a significantly strained Pd-rich cap-
ping layer, where the strain is transmitted by the pseudomorphic 
growth of Pd(111) on the hexagonal Pd sublattice in PdCoO2.
Pd nanoparticle reference measurements. Since the particle size 
and density of surface states of Pd nanocrystals in the capping layer 
(2–10 nm) differ from those of bulk Pd, which can affect the catalytic 
activity53,55, we studied the electrochemical activity of Pd nanopar-
ticles of comparable size (1–10 nm; Sciventions) to gauge the effect 
of the particle morphology and strain on the catalytic activity  
(see Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). Rietveld-refined XRD mea-
surements of the dried reference nanoparticles revealed an average

lattice constant of 3.90 ± 0.02 Å (see Supplementary Fig. 14), which 
fit the reported values for bulk Pd (3.89 Å) and Pd nanostructures 
with a size of 8–10 nm (ref. 53). The lattice constant of the nanopar-
ticles was thus 2% smaller than for the nanocrystals in the Pd cap-
ping layer (3.98 Å). Since a comparable surface coverage and active 
surface area were difficult to achieve, the catalytic properties of both 
bulk Pd and the nanoparticles are best characterized by their Tafel 
slope, which is only sensitive to the underlying catalytic process and 
independent of the actual effective surface area36. Both the nanopar-
ticles and the bulk Pd showed a similar Tafel slope of ~105 mV dec−1 
(Supplementary Figs. 15 and 2), consistent with the Pd literature 
value of 103 mV dec−1 (ref. 43), which relates the surface catalytic pro-
cess to a rate-limiting Volmer (discharge) reaction. These values were 
much larger than the values found for surface-modified PdCoO2 in 
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 (38 and 30 mV dec−1, respectively),  
suggesting a rate-limiting Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel 
mechanism (38 and 30 mV dec−1, respectively)36,56. The intrinsic cat-
alytic mechanism of the strained Pd capping layer is thus different 
from pure Pd, regardless of particle size or morphology.
Discussion
To rationalize the observed tensile strain-induced activity increase 
in PdCoO2, we first considered the effect of strain as expected from 
classical d-band theory, which predicts a correlation between the 
position of the metal d-band centre and the HER activity47. The 
relative energies of the metal d band and the antibonding hydrogen 
σ* orbital directly determine their overlap, and hence the bonding 
strength of the H-adsorbate to the metal surface, ΔGH
57. Following 
Sabatier’s principle, the catalyst–substrate interaction should be nei-
ther too strong nor too weak, such that both adsorption of the sub-
strate and desorption of the product are facile. Hence, ΔGH is used 
as the most relevant descriptor of the intrinsic activity for HER, 
given by a turnover frequency or j0 resulting in a volcano plot, with 
optimal catalyst–substrate interactions at the top of the volcano36,58. 
Tensile lattice strain in Pd tends to flatten out the d bands while 
upshifting the band centre towards the Fermi level, leading to stron-
ger overlap with the hydrogen σ* orbital and, thus, stronger metal–
H bonds12,59. In fact, growth of a pseudomorphic Pd layer on a single 
crystalline substrate with a larger lattice constant has been shown to 
increase ΔGH and thus move tensile-strained Pd away from the top 
of the volcano while decreasing the exchange current density13,47. 
Interestingly, we observed the opposite trend, both enhancing j0 
and reducing the Tafel slope. An increase in activity may partially 
be due to increased porosity, and hence increased surface area and 
the formation of grain boundaries, which influence the strain (and 
vice versa) on twinned Pd nanoparticles marginally by 0.3%53. 
However, such structural modifications typically contribute to the 
number of active sites, hence increasing j0, rather than modifying 
the calatytic mechanism (Tafel slope) in the absence of substantial 
strain effects53,60–62.
The observed change in the Tafel slope by a factor of almost 3 
with respect to bulk Pd suggests that a more fundamental change 
in the material's surface properties is at play. Indeed, tensile strain 
positively affects the hydrogen adsorption capacity of Pd and has 
been described to modify the potential of hydrogen adsorption in 
Pd47,63–65. In contrast, the different lattice parameters between hydro-
gen-poor α-Pd and the hydrogen-rich β phase (sharp transition and 
discontinuous lattice parameter transition from 3.89–4.02 Å) kinet-
ically hinder a phase transformation66–68. Since our expanded Pd fcc 
lattice intrinsically showed stable lattice parameters (as probed by 
transmission electron microscopy after prolonged ex  situ sample 
storage) close to those of β-PdHx (3.98 and 4.02 Å, respectively)68,69, 
incorporation of hydrogen is expected to be more facile63. This con-
jecture rationalizes the corresponding findings on the Tafel slopes, 
which indeed showed β-PdHx-like behaviour (30–38 mV dec−1 
Tafel slope)45,56. To investigate the possible operando formation of 
a hydride phase, faster cyclic voltammetry measurements (25 and 
100 mV s−1) were recorded after 1,000 cycles (Supplementary Fig. 16).  
With increasing scan rate, a stronger capacitive contribution was 
observed. This was most prominent for PdCoO2, as evidenced 
by the separation of the forward and backward scans around the 
open circuit potential, and the open circuit potential shifted to 
more cathodic potentials for this material (Supplementary Fig. 16;  
100 mV s−1 scans). In accordance with the impedance data pre-
sented in Supplementary Fig. 4, this indicates that the capping layer 
is active for hydrogen adsorption—a well-known phenomenon 
in Pd metal that forms interstitial hydrides (PdHx)42,44,45. Since the 
sorption effects are very fast (~1 s), the transition to β-PdHx can 
occur almost immediately once a strained Pd capping layer has been 
formed under reductive conditions. Similar findings were recently 
reported on strained, sorption-active Pd overlayers obtained by 
chronoamperometry on PdCoO2
70.
In summary, we investigated the delafossite oxides PdCrO2, 
PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 for HER activity in acidic media. In their pris-
tine form, these materials outperform most reported electrocata-
lysts with respect to their overpotentials required for 10 mA cm−2
geo 
(71 ± 15 mV for PdCrO2, 54 ± 12 mV for PdCoO2 and 82 ± 3 mV 
for PtCoO2 in the first cycles). The very high activity for HER 
originates from a superior intrinsic surface activity, translating 
into exchange current densities on the order of mA cm−2 (initially, 
1.9 ± 0.8 mA cm−2 for PdCrO2, 2.0 ± 0.3 mA cm−2 for PdCoO2 and 
0.57 ± 0.12 mA cm−2 for PtCoO2), which are orders of magnitude 
higher than most HER catalysts besides Pt. This property is espe-
cially beneficial for HER at small overpotentials, where the effect 
of activity increase by the Tafel slope does not yet come into play. 
While PdCrO2 is relatively stable under acid HER conditions, the 
surfaces of PtCoO2, and especially PdCoO2, corrode over time via 
the reductive dissolution of Co and O at the surface near region. 
The resulting Pd- or Pt-enriched capping layers show significantly 
enhanced activities compared with the bulk materials: j0 increases 
by a factor of 2.5 and 3.5 for PdCoO2 and PtCoO2, while the Tafel 
slopes decrease from 76 ± 13 to 38 ± 3 mV dec−1 and from 65 ± 3 to 
50 ± 2 mV dec−1, respectively.
In the case of PdCoO2, the tensile strain, which is present in the 
noble metal sublattice of all of these delafossites, is translated to 
the Pd fcc capping layer, which grows directly on the underlying 
bulk material in the form of an isotropically strained β-PdHx phase 
(+2% strain on average; 0 to +4% at FWHM; see Supplementary 
Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 6). The substrate-templated strain 
increases the hydrogen adsorption energy, as predicted by d-band 
theory, and lowers the energetic barrier for the formation of a 
β-PdHx phase, which otherwise requires a significant lattice expan-
sion (+3.3%). This phase transformation entails a change in HER 
mechanism, shifting the surface catalytic process away from the 
rate-limiting Volmer reaction found in Pd towards the more effi-
cient Volmer–Tafel or Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The result-
ing material has an overpotential of 12 ± 3 mV for 10 mA cm−2
geo 
only, outperforming even bulk Pt.
The strain engineering presented here points towards a more 
general design principle for the rational activity enhancement in 
electrocatalysts with inherently strained metal sublattices. It fur-
ther suggests that phase transformations, stabilized by strain, may 
be key players in determining both metal–substrate interactions 
and intrinsic catalytic activity, and as such, strain-induced phase 
changes may complement classical d-band theory as a model to  
predict catalytic performance.
Methods
Synthesis of PdCrO2, PdCoO2 and PtCoO2. Our synthesis of PdCrO2 was 
based on a method described in the literature20. First, an LiCrO2 precursor was 
prepared from Li2CO3 (Acros; 99+%) and Cr2O3 (Fisher Scientific; extra pure) at 
1,100 °C. The obtained homogeneous grey powder (2 eq.) was subsequently ground

together with metallic Pd (1 eq.; Alfa Aesar; 99.95%) powder and PdCl2 (1 eq.; Alfa 
Aesar; 99.9%). Then, the mixture was heated for 24 h at 800 °C under an argon 
atmosphere. For removal of the LiCl side phase, the powder was washed twice 
with H2O and once with ethanol and dried at 60 °C. The synthesis of micrometre-
sized PdCoO2, which was used for the electrochemical measurements in the main 
text, was based on a procedure described in the literature71. In brief, well-mixed 
stoichiometric powder of PdCl2 (1 eq.; Alfa Aesar; 99.9%) and CoO (2 eq.; Alfa 
Aesar; 99.995%) were heated to 1,000 °C in an evacuated quartz ampoule to obtain 
PdCoO2. CoCl2 was removed by dissolving in water or in hot ethanol. The obtained 
PdCoO2 crystals were subsequently used as seed crystals to increase the size in a 
second or third step. The synthesis of up to millimetre-sized PdCoO2 was based 
on a modified version of a procedure described in the literature72. A mixture 
of 194 mg PdCl2 (1 eq.; Alfa Aesar) and 164 mg CoO (2.2 eq.; Alfa Aesar) were 
ground, pelletized and reacted in a corundum crucible in an evacuated quartz 
ampoule. The reactants were heated to 700 °C at 3 °C min−1, held at Tmax for 40 h and 
cooled at 3 °C min−1 to room temperature. A 10% excess of CoO was necessary to 
balance the losses due to a reaction between the crucible wall and the purple spinel 
CoAl2O4. After washing the product with ethanol to remove CoCl2, the reaction 
yielded metallic crystalline platelets. For the growth of larger, flat crystals of up to 
1 mm, some seed crystals were added to the mixture. The addition of 10–20 mg 
TeCl4 somewhat inhibited growth along the plane, yielding higher, bulkier crystals 
with a reduced aspect ratio. PtCoO2 crystals were synthesized following a similar 
route35. Well-mixed stoichiometric powders of PtCl2 (1 eq.; Alfa Aesar; 99.9%) and 
CoO (2 eq.; Alfa Aesar; 99.995%) were heated up to 700 or 800 °C in an evacuated 
quartz tube to obtain small PtCoO2 crystals. The byproduct CoCl2 can be removed 
by leaching with water or hot ethanol. Unlike in the case of PdCoO2, using seed 
crystals did not lead to millimetre-sized crystals.
Sample and electrode preparation. Electrochemical measurements were 
performed in 1 M H2SO4 (pH = 0) using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode with 
saturated KCl (+0.197 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode), and a Pt wire or 
large-area Pt plate (>10 cm2) as the counter electrode. The delafossite working 
electrodes were prepared in two different ways. For PdCoO2 only, large single 
crystals were glued with Ag paste to a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate, which 
was in contact with a Cu cable. The contacts were sealed by Scotch-Weld DP410 
epoxy. Remnants of the Ag paste around the crystals were covered with nail 
polish, which was proven, through tests, to be inert beforehand. In all other cases, 
the microcrystals were too small to be connected directly and thus measured on 
carbon paste electrodes. For this purpose, 1.5±0.1 mg of the respective material 
was deposited on the surface of the electrode area and pressed gently using carbon 
paper to ensure adhesion. The carbon paste electrodes consisted of a Teflon block 
with a 0.2 cm2 area filled with carbon paste (for each, 2.5 g graphite was mixed  
with 0.9 ml paraffin oil) that formed a conductive and flexible but inactive substrate 
for the electrochemical investigations. The mass loading was determined using a 
Quartz crystal microbalance.
Electrochemical measurements. The electrocatalytic measurements were 
performed in a home-made, closed glass reactor or beaker. The electrolyte was 
purged with >99% pure H2 for at least 20 min before every measurement through a 
porous glass frit. This was to remove dissolved oxygen and to saturate the solution 
with H2 in order to provide a well-defined redox potential that was consistent with 
long-term working conditions. The RHE potential for the respective electrolytes 
was measured under the same conditions using a Pt wire as the working electrode 
and re-evaluated during the cycling process to avoid fluctuations of the reference 
electrode in the mV region. For Faradaic efficiency measurements, the sealed 
reactor was purged with Argon before the measurement until no hydrogen or 
oxygen was found in the head space (see ‘Product analysis’). The head space was 
then sampled with a gas chromatograph (see ‘Product analysis’). The respective 
results were referenced against measurements for which two platinum wires were 
used as the working electrode and counter electrode. All measurements were 
recorded using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat and the IviumSoft software. 
To correct for the series resistance to construct the Tafel plots, impedance 
measurements were recorded close to the RHE (overpotential: 10 mV; current 
density: usually ~1 mA cm−2; 10 mV a.c. amplitude) and the series resistance was 
extracted by fitting to a Randles circuit in the high-frequency region. All values 
obtained before the respective Tafel measurement cycles were very similar, so the 
average value of every sample resistance was used. To account for the IR drop, the 
overpotential with respect to the calibration point with two Pt wires was corrected 
by subtracting I × R (current multiplied by series resistance). The Tafel slope was 
extracted from the linear region above 1 mA cm−2 using the data from both the 
forward and backward scans to exclude for possible surface capacitance effects.  
In all cases, from cycle 10 onwards, the forward and backward scans were overlaid, 
so that capacitive contributions could be excluded. The values provided are 
averages, and their respective errors originate from different samples that were 
measured in the same way. At least three measurements were performed for the 
data shown in the main text, after qualitative tests had been performed beforehand.
SECM measurements. The SECM measurements were performed with a 
SECM M470 from Bio-Logic, which was controlled by the Bio-Logic M470 
software. PdCoO2 microcrystals were washed in concentrated HNO3 before the 
measurements, to remove any possible Pd-rich surface layer that might enhance 
catalytic activity. Subsequently, the sample was glued to an inactive Au-coated 
substrate using Ag paste, which was sealed with nail polish. This way, the  
sample potential could be controlled by contacting the Au-covered substrate.  
The sample and substrates were placed in a Teflon cell equipped with an Ag/AgCl  
reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The electrolyte 
employed contained 10 mM H2SO4 and 20 mM Na2SO4 exposed to air. Before the 
measurements, the feedback electrode was polished, to ensure a clean Pt tip,  
and pre-cleaned by applying +0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl until the current stabilized.
SEM and focused ion beam. SEM measurements were performed with a Merlin 
SEM from Zeiss at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV. For transmission electron 
microscopy lamella preparation and imaging, a Zeiss Crossbeam 1540 EsB focused 
ion beam was used.
Product analysis. The dissolved and gaseous products of the electrochemical 
cycling were analysed by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectroscopy, to analyse the composition of the liquid phase, as well as by gas 
chromatography for the reactor head space. The product distribution in the head 
space of the glass reactors was analysed using an S + H Trace GC Ultra, which 
was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The gas chromatography was 
calibrated for Faradaic efficiency measurements with a platinum wire within the 
same reactor.
STEM characterization. STEM was performed on a Titan Themis microscope 
operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The aberration correction on the 
probe-forming lenses enabled the focus of the electron probe down to a size of 
~1 Å, at a 24-mrad convergence semiangle. STEM images were recorded using 
the HAADF detector, with collection semiangles between 73 and 352 mrad. EDS 
spectrum images were recorded using a windowless, four-quadrant silicon-drift 
detector (Super-X) with a solid angle of >0.7 sr. Multivariate analysis on the EDS 
spectrum image data was performed to reduce the noise51. Then, the elemental 
concentrations were quantified using the Cliff–Lorimer formula. To reach the 
highest precision for the determination of lattice constants in the Pd cap layer, the 
instrument was calibrated in situ. The interplanar spacing was calibrated according 
to PdCoO2 (0,0,0,12) and (1,0,−1,−1) interplanar spacings, using the lattice 
parameters from XRD and literature values. Both interplanar spacings yielded 
comparable results (0.35% relative difference). The following results were analysed 
and plotted using the XRD calibration shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
XPS. XPS analysis was performed with a Thermo VG Theta Probe 300 system 
using monochromatic incident Al Kα radiation (hν = 1,486.68 eV; spot size: 400 μm; 
base pressure: <10−7 Pa; average detection angle: 53° with respect to the sample 
surface). Spectral decomposition of the as-measured spectra was performed by 
subtraction of a Shirley-type inelastic background over the concerned binding 
energy range for each spectral region, and subsequent, constrained, linear-least-
squares fitting with one or more symmetrical (mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian) peak 
components (while taking the same Gaussian–Lorentzian fraction and FWHM for 
each component in the fitted spectrum). A flood gun was used to reduce the effect 
of surface charging. This may have led to small measurement errors up to 1 eV.  
To eliminate small systematic deviations, the binding energy of adventitious carbon 
was set to 283.8 eV. All other peaks were referenced to the literature, taking into 
account all element lines73.
