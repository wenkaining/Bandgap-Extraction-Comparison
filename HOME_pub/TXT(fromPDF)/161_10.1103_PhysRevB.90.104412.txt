We have carried out high magnetic ﬁeld studies of single-crystalline Li2MnO3, a honeycomb lattice
antiferromagnet. Its magnetic phase diagram was mapped out using magnetization measurements at applied
ﬁelds up to 35 T. Our results show that it undergoes two successive meta-magnetic transitions around 9 T ﬁelds
applied perpendicular to the ab plane (along the c∗axis). These phase transitions are completely absent in the
magnetization measured with the ﬁeld applied along the ab plane. In order to understand this magnetic phase
diagram, we developed a mean-ﬁeld model starting from the correct N´eel-type magnetic structure, consistent
with our single crystal neutron diffraction data at zero ﬁeld. Our model calculations succeeded in explaining the
two meta-magnetic transitions that arise when Li2MnO3 enters two different spin-ﬂop phases from the zero ﬁeld
N´eel phase.

I. INTRODUCTION
The honeycomb lattice has the smallest number of (three)
nearest neighbors that are possible for two-dimensional (2D)
systems. Materials with the honeycomb lattice structure have
attracted considerable interest over the years in the condensed
matter community, not least for the discovery of massless
Dirac fermions in graphene [1,2]. At the same time, a
honeycomb lattice consisting of magnetic ions are the focus
of some interesting ideas such as the Kitaev model [3],
wherein frustrated, directional anisotropic nearest neighbor
interactions yield a spin liquid ground state from which exotic
quasiparticles called anyons may emerge. Moreover, these
may serve as the basis for fault-tolerant quantum computers
[4]. Another interesting quantum spin liquid phase was also
reported for the Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice [5],
while a topological insulating state has been discussed in cases
where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is sufﬁciently strong, such
as Na2IrO3 [6,7].
Honeycomb lattice compounds containing Ir4+ ions (such
as Li2IrO3 and Na2IrO3), with a large SOC leading to an
effective total angular momentum Jeff = 1/2 [8–12], have
drawn both theoretical and experimental interests in recent
years, as they are seen to be probable test beds for the Kitaev
model. Nevertheless, these A2IrO3 compounds (with A = Li
and Na) differ from the ideal Kitaev model in that isotropic
Heisenberg exchange interactions, arising mainly from direct
exchange between nearest neighbor Ir ions, compete with the
directional anisotropic Kitaev interactions. The ground state
of such a Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model may be one of two
*jgpark10@snu.ac.kr
spin-liquid or four long-range ordered phases depending on the
relative strengths of the Kitaev and the Heisenberg interactions
[13], while the A2IrO3 systems were identiﬁed to be long-range
ordered zigzag-type antiferromagnets (AFMs) [14,15].
In order to understand better the physics of the honeycomb
lattice at a strong SOC limit, it can be a useful and, at the same
time, an interesting exercise to investigate honeycomb lattice
materials at a weak SOC limit. This is the approach we adopted
here by examining thoroughly one such example, Li2MnO3,
which also belongs to the “213” honeycomb structure family
of compounds [16] with the general formula A2T MO3 [17].
It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Due to its
interesting electrochemical activity [18], Li2MnO3 has been
widely studied for applications in Li batteries. Below the N´eel
temperature, TN = 36.5 K, Li2MnO3 exhibits an antiferromag-
netic ordering of the magnetic moments of Mn4+ ions [19].
As shown in Fig. 1(a), it has an alternate stacking of a layer of
Li(1)O6 octahedron occupying the center of a honeycomblike
structure formed by MnO6 edge sharing octahedrons and
another layer of Li(2)O6 and Li(3)O6 edge sharing octahe-
drons. The Mn4+ ions in Li2MnO3 occupying the centers
of MnO6 octahedrons set up a modiﬁed honeycomb lattice
network (in the top and bottom ab planes) which fairly mimics
the 2D-honeycomb lattice structure of graphene. Therefore,
both Mn-O-Mn superexchange and Mn-Mn Heisenberg direct
exchange interactions are simultaneously possible in the ab
plane of Li2MnO3 [see Fig. 1(b)]. Because the MnO6 layers
are well separated by the LiO6 octahedral layer, Li2MnO3
exhibits magnetic properties that are quasi-2D in nature. The
antiferromagnetic ordering of a Li2MnO3 single crystal and
some of its physical properties have already been reported
[20]. In this paper we present our experimental investigations
on the magnetic spin structure and magnetic ﬁeld (H) induced

Li2MnO3 single crystal measured up to 35 T. The experimental
results are compared with the results of mean-ﬁeld model
calculations based on a simple Heisenberg Hamiltonian with
a single ion anisotropy term.
II. EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
The Li2MnO3 single crystals were grown by a two-step
ﬂux method [20]. In the ﬁrst step, polycrystalline Li2MnO3
powder was prepared from Li2CO3 (99.997%) and MnO2
(99.99%). The stoichiometrically mixed starting materials
(with 10 mol % of excess Li2CO3) were pressed into a pellet
and placed in an alumina crucible for heat treatments. A high
temperature solid state reaction was carried out by heating the
pellet to 1027 ◦C at the rate of 100 ◦C/h and dwelling for 48 h.
Thereafter the polycrystalline Li2MnO3 sample was cooled
to room temperature at the rate of 60 ◦C/h. The sample was
examined for phase purity and crystallinity using a table-top
x-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Miniﬂex II). In the second step,
polycrystalline Li2MnO3 powder was mixed in a plastic bottle
with the ﬂux (Li2CO3 premixed with ﬁnely ground B2O3)
in the molar ratio of 1:(2.76:2.39), respectively. This mixture
was transferred to a platinum (Pt) crucible and closed using a
suitable Pt lid. The Li2MnO3 single crystals were grown in the
Pt crucible using the following heating proﬁle: (i) heating from
room temperature (RT) to 1092 ◦C at the rate of 100 ◦C/h,
(ii) dwelling at 1092 ◦C for 10 h, (iii) cooling to 720 ◦C at the
rate of 2 ◦C/h, (iv) dwelling at 720 ◦C for a short period of
10 min, and (v) natural cooling to RT (by turning the furnace
off).
Single crystal neutron diffraction (ND) data of Li2MnO3 at
10 K were collected using a four circle diffractometer (FCD)
having a Ge (3 1 1) monochromator and with neutron beam
of wavelength λn = 1.8343 ˚A (HANARO reactor, Korea).
The ND data were ﬁtted using the FullProf program for
different probable magnetic structure models [21,22]. High
ﬁeld magnetization at different temperatures was measured
using the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL),
Florida (USA), with applied ﬁelds up to 35 T. Additional
detailed temperature-dependent magnetization measurements
were carried out up to 14 T using the vibrating sample mag-
netometer (VSM) option of a physical property measurement
system (PPMS), Quantum Design. We also performed mean-
ﬁeld model calculations for the magnetization of a Li2MnO3
single crystal using the McPhase software suite [23].
III. RESULTS
A. Magnetic structure of Li2MnO3
As stated in the Introduction, the antiferromagnetic struc-
ture of Li2MnO3 has already been reported by Lee et al.
[20]. However, following a recent report [24] that presents a
contradicting Cx-type AFM model structure that is claimed to
ﬁt the muon-spin rotation and relaxation (μ+SR) experimental
data, we were prompted to reinvestigate the magnetic structure
of Li2MnO3 using the single crystal ND data: We measured
320 magnetic Bragg peaks and used 221 independent peaks
in our analysis. We attempted to ﬁt the experimental ND
data (collected at 10 K) using the following magnetic model
structures: Fx, Fy, Fxz (Fz), Cx, Cy, and Cxz (Cz)-type AFMs.
Here the symbols F and C denote, respectively, ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic arrangements (interlayer coupling) of
magnetic moments in the ab plane with AFM interlayer
coupling between any two successive ab planes along the c
axis. The direction of the magnetic moments are indicated by
the symbols x, y, z, and xz corresponding to the crystallographic
a, b, c axes and the ac plane of Li2MnO3, respectively. The Fy,
Fxz, Cy, and Cxz magnetic model structures have, respectively,
the 1g, 3g, 4u, and 2u symmetry [20]. With the Cxz-type
AFM spin structure, we obtained the best agreement between
calculated structure factor (F 2
calc) and observed structure factor
(F 2
obs) of Li2MnO3. A schematic drawing of the Cxz-type AFM
spin structure is shown in Fig. 2 together with our ﬁtting results
for all other models for reference. Thus, we again conﬁrm that
the magnetic structure of Li2MnO3 is the Cxz-type AFM with
the 2u symmetry.
In Li2MnO3, in addition to the nearest neighbor AFM
coupling in the ab plane, the magnetic moments have anti-
ferromagnetic (interlayer) coupling along the c axis which
doubles the c-axis length of the magnetic unit cell with respect
to that of the crystallographic (or chemical) unit cell. The
reﬁned magnetic moment per Mn4+ ion [μord ≈2.29(1)μB]
has 0.67(3), 0, and 2.43(1) μB as the components along
the a, b, and c axes of the unit cell, respectively. Since
the magnetic structure requires a strong nearest neighbor
(J1) antiferromagnetic interaction and the nearest neighbor
Mn-Mn distance is close (2.8 ˚A), it is likely that the
direct exchange interaction dominates over the probable Mn-
O-Mn superexchange interaction which may be weak and
ferromagnetic, due to the Mn-O-Mn bond angle (96°) being
close to 90° [25].

sured at different temperatures with external magnetic ﬁelds

sharp, nonlinear increase with increasing H. No such features
were observed with H ∥ab plane (H  c∗) at any temperature,
as shown in Fig. 3(b), indicative of spin-ﬂop transitions
[26,27]. Accordingly we call the corresponding transition
ﬁelds spin-ﬂop ﬁelds, HSF1 and HSF2, respectively. As seen
from Fig. 3(a), the values of HSF1 and HSF2 increase with T
up to TN. Figure 3(c) shows an expanded view of M measured
at different temperatures for both increasing and decreasing
H  ab plane (H ∥c∗), illustrating the hysteretic behavior
of the SF transitions between HSF1 and HSF2. Interestingly, M
measured at 2, 5, and 10 K show two clear hysteresis loops,
with one that is closer to the HSF2 enclosing a relatively lower
area than the other that is closer to HSF1. The hysteresis loops
in the M vs H data indicate ﬁrst-order phase transitions [25].
Figure 4 shows the temperature dependent magnetization of
a Li2MnO3 single crystal measured using ﬁeld-cooled warm-
ing protocol with various constant magnetic ﬁelds applied
perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane (i.e., parallel and
perpendicular to the c∗axis). The M vs T curve measured
at H = 0.03 T shows a broad maximum around 50 K and a
kink at TN ≈36.5 K, which is more clearly seen for H ∥c∗
than for H  c∗. As the applied external magnetic ﬁeld is
increased, TN gradually decreases. Below TN, a minimum is
observed in the magnetization for H||c∗> 8.5 T and it shifts
to higher temperatures with increasing ﬁeld until H > 11 T,
where no clear (or sharp) minimum can be seen. At higher
ﬁelds, for example H = 14 T, the changes in magnetization
corresponding to both H ∥c∗and H  c∗appear to be
very similar. The minima in M are due to the SF transitions
corresponding to the speciﬁc values of H  ab plane (i.e.,
H ∥c∗), because these occur only for H applied (nearly)
parallel/antiparallel to the direction of the magnetic moments
(μ) of an antiferromagnet with low anisotropy [27] and not for
H  μ. We note here that, in principle, the SF transitions can
be either ﬁrst order or second order [28].

single crystal. The data points are derived from the experimental
magnetization measured at either ﬁxed temperatures (▲and ▼
symbols) or ﬁelds (■and ⋆symbols) while sweeping the other
parameter. (The lines connecting the data points are guides to the
eyes.) The phase diagram constructed from our mean-ﬁeld model
calculations (shaded area) is shown as the background for the phase
diagram of experimental data. The magnetic spin structures of the
ordered AFM (obtained from the analysis of experimental single
crystal neutron diffraction data), spin ﬂop (SF), and intermediate SF
phases (obtained in the mean-ﬁeld analysis) are also shown. The
inset shows an expanded view of the phase diagrams with a trend
of merging ﬁrst-order HSF1 and HSF2 boundary lines and joining the
second-order PM-AFM/SF phase boundary line.
C. Magnetic phase diagram of Li2MnO3
As shown in Fig. 5, we construct a magnetic phase diagram
based on the experimental results: the variation of TN with
H (
symbol), and the SF transition ﬁelds (HSF1 and HSF2)
obtained from M vs H hysteresis measurements (▲and ▼
symbols) and the M vs T curves at different ﬁxed H ∥c∗(■
and ⋆symbols). The transition from the paramagnetic (PM)
phase to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is a second-order
phase transition whose transition temperature (TN) decreases
with increasing H. For T ≪TN, the AFM phase is separated
from the SF phase by two ﬁrst-order phase boundary lines
(indicated by ▲, ▼, ■, and ⋆symbols). The lines connecting
those data points are guides to the eyes. The inset of Fig. 5
(an expanded view of the phase diagram) shows the trend of
merging ﬁrst-order HSF1 and HSF2 boundary lines and joining
the second-order PM-AFM/SF phase boundary line. The
merging point [(10 < Ht < 11 T), T ≈TN(Ht)] is a tricritical
point in the H-T diagram of Li2MnO3 which connects the
PM, AFM, and SF phases. While the high ﬁeld SF phase
should have magnetic moments in the ab plane, the structure of
the intermediate phase (at HSF1 < H < HSF2) was unclear,
leading us to perform a mean-ﬁeld analysis.
D. Mean-ﬁeld analysis and the spin-ﬂop transition of Li2MnO3
The essential features of the observed SF transitions
and some other physical properties of Li2MnO3 may be
described by a spin S = 3/2 Heisenberg model with weak
easy axis anisotropy (along the c∗axis), using the following

where the summations run over nearest (n.), next-nearest (n.n.),
and next-next-nearest (n.n.n.) neighbor (ith and jth) Mn ions
in the ab plane, and nearest neighbors along the c direction
(n.c.) with associated exchange parameters J1, J2, J3, and
Jc, respectively [as shown in Fig. 1(b)], and K is the single
ion anisotropy parameter. As a ﬁrst step, a single spin-ﬂop
transition can be produced by a simpliﬁed model with only
nonzero J1 and K, which may be uniquely deﬁned by the
N´eel temperature and the critical ﬁeld value. But, the observed
two spin-ﬂop transitions require an additional, small, nonzero
Jc. While the interlayer interaction (Jc) is necessary for the
Cxz-type AFM spin structure it also stabilizes an intermediate
ﬁeld structure, wherein only moments on the alternate ab
planes have ﬂopped, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The magnitude of
Jc determines the difference between the spin-ﬂop ﬁelds (HSF2
−HSF1), and thus may be ﬁxed by the experimental results.
Since the next- and next-next-nearest neighbor intralayer
interactions (J2 and J3) and the interlayer interaction (Jc)
likely share similar Mn-O-Li-O-Mn superexchange pathways
that are separated by almost the same distances, they should, a
priori, be of similar magnitude. Therefore, we have ﬁxed the
values of J2 and J3 at twice the magnitude of Jc. Unfortunately
this produces a large change in the magnetization at the
spin-ﬂop transition that is calculated to be approximately twice
the measured values. In order to reduce this and to match with
the experimentally observed change in the magnetization, we
need unphysically larger values of J2 or J3.
Given the above constraints, we found that the fol-
lowing set of exchange and anisotropy constants explains
our data: J1 = −0.84 meV,J2 = J3 = −0.02 meV,Jc = −
0.01 meV, and K = −0.067 meV. The calculated magnetiza-
tion is shown as dashed lines (MFCs) in Figs. 3(a)–3(c) and
4, and the calculated magnetic phase diagram is given by the
background in Fig. 5. The spin-ﬂop transitions are calculated
to be ﬁrst order at low temperatures, which is consistent with
the experimental observations, and apparently merging at Tࣈ
16 K. Above this temperature, as a function of increasing ﬁeld,
the moments rotate smoothly from being perpendicular to the
ab plane to parallel to the ab plane, reminiscent of a liquid-gas
critical point. However, although the agreement between
the theoretical calculations and the experimental results are
reasonably good, there are clear disagreements too. A most
noticeable case is that the calculated magnetization is bigger
than the experimental ﬁeld dependence of the magnetization
data shown in Fig. 3. We have tested several alternative models
by varying values of J and K to resolve this discrepancy
before coming to a conclusion that the magnetic moment
of Mn ions may as well be effectively smaller in the real
material than the spin-only ionic value (3 μB). In fact, the
ordered moment determined by the ND reﬁnements is not
3 μB but 2.3 μB. This is strong evidence that supports
our idea. Moreover, short-ranged ﬂuctuations, often present
in two-dimensional spin systems, can reduce the effective
spin value too, which, in principle, cannot be accounted for
mean-ﬁeld calculations. Therefore, we repeated the calcu-
lations using the following set of parameters for a spin S
= 1 model: J1 = −1.55 meV, J2 = J3 = −0.02 meV,Jc =
−0.025 meV, and K = −0.109 meV. The results of the
MFCs using S = 1 are shown by the dashed-symbol lines
in Fig. 3, which exhibits signiﬁcant improvement over that
of MFCs using S = 3/2. [See also calculated M(T ) results
in Fig. 4.] However, we note that the overall phase diagram
remains almost unchanged when compared to that for the S =
3/2 case. The magnetic structures presented in Fig. 5 are the
results of our mean-ﬁeld calculations, and that corresponding
to the low-ﬁeld region in the H-T phase diagram is indeed
consistent with our analysis of the experimental data as shown
in Figs. 1 and 2.
IV. DISCUSSIONS
It is well known that the SF occurs if an external magnetic
ﬁeld of sufﬁcient strength is applied parallel to one of the
two sublattice magnetic moments of an antiferromagnet with
a small easy axis anisotropy [26,27]. The whole process of
SF is an act of reducing the energy of the system which,
otherwise, is higher if one of the AFM sublattice’s moments
point antiparallel to a sufﬁciently strong H. The spin-ﬂop
transition in a Li2MnO3 single crystal occurs in two steps.
In ﬁrst step, when an external magnetic ﬁeld of strength
HSF1 < H < HSF2 is present, only the spins of the alternate
ab planes ﬂop, because the spin ﬂop occurs against the
single ion anisotropy (SIA) term (K) which adds additional
energy if the spins in all the ab planes ﬂop for the same
strength of H. Eventually, the interlayer antiferromagnetic
exchange interaction (Jc) is weakened in the presence of a
strong magnetic ﬁeld. In the second step, when H is increased
further to H ⩾HSF2(<HFM), the spins of the other alternate
ab planes also ﬂop because this reduces the total energy of
the system (even though it would add a little energy due to
K). Here HFM is a possible (hypothetical) ﬁeld of unknown
strength, such that for H ⩾HFM ≫HSF2, all the spins in
all the ab planes ﬂip to align parallel to H and establish a
ﬁeld-induced ferromagnetic (FM) phase. Inspecting the high
ﬁeld magnetization data shown in Fig. 3(a), we estimate HFM
to be in the range of 70–100 T. For concreteness, the transition
ﬁelds above which a ferromagnetically saturated structure is
obtained in the mean ﬁeld calculation are 65 T for the S = 3
2
model and 90 T for S = 1.
In fact, it is interesting to note that a FM spin structure in
a honeycomb lattice system (even though a classical ground
state) is another possible magnetic phase of the HK model
[13,29] that is widely studied at present. It may be possible
to observe a ﬁeld-induced FM phase in a honeycomb lattice
system (e.g., Li2MnO3 or a similar one) at extremely high
magnetic ﬁelds. We observe that the search for honeycomb
lattice systems with such ﬁeld-induced FM phase or FM
ground state may lead to the emergence of new applications of
magnetism in a honeycomb lattice. Perhaps this is achievable
in some new materials with similar structure or materials
that offer honeycomb lattice for magnetic ions and have
strong single ion anisotropy. A modiﬁed Kitaev Hamiltonian,
104412-5K. BALAMURUGAN et al.
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 104412 (2014)
introduced by Baskaran et al., has been shown to be exactly
solvable for all half-odd-integer spins and commented as “it
is equivalent to an exponentially large number of copies of
spin-1/2 Kitaev Hamiltonians” [30]. This modiﬁed spin-S
Kitaev Hamiltonian may be thought to replace the original
Kitaev interaction terms of the currently considered HK model,
so that the modiﬁed HK model would be more general and may
be applicable to any real honeycomb lattice materials with high
spins (S > 1/2) also, such as Li2MnO3.
By our high ﬁeld magnetization studies of a Li2MnO3 single
crystal and the mean-ﬁeld model calculations, we found that
the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction (Jc) along the c
axis shows distinguishable features in the magnetization and
SF transition. This ﬁnding is important since the interlayer
coupling is mostly neglected in theoretical studies of the mag-
netic phase diagram of honeycomb lattice systems. Overall, we
foundthat it is essential tocomprehendtheﬁeld-inducedphase,
which may well be relevant for other magnetic honeycomb
lattice systems. Furthermore, besides the fact that the spins of
Mn4+ ions in Li2MnO3 can be treated effectively as classical
spins, its N´eel-type AFM spin structure may be thought of as
one of the classical ground states of the HK model with Kitaev
interaction of negligible or effectively zero strength relative
to the strength of isotropic Heisenberg interaction. This is
justiﬁable because in the HK model reported by Chaloupka
et al., the N´eel-type AFM phase exists for a wide range of “ϕ”
(−34◦< ϕ < 88◦), where ϕ is a phase angle determined by
the relative strength of the Kitaev term (2K) with respect
to the Heisenberg term (J) : φ = cos−1(
J
√
K2+J2 ) [13]. Our
analysis suggests that the Kitaev term should be very small
for Li2MnO3 compared with the Heisenberg term. Thus,
the phase angle (ϕ) is almost zero for Li2MnO3, which
produces the N´eel phase according to the theoretical results
in Refs. [13] and [29], which is in good agreement with our
experimental results. What is particularly interesting about
our data regarding the general phase diagram of the HK
model is the newly discovered ﬁeld-induced spin-ﬂop phases
and the ferromagnetic (FM) phase. First of all, there is no
theoretical prediction available at the moment for the HK
Hamiltonian plus a Zeeman term so we cannot make a direct
comparison with our data. However, it is intriguing that in
all theoretical phase diagrams of Refs. [13] and [29] the
magnetic structure we found for the spin-ﬂop phase is not
found to be stable. Second, our high ﬁeld data demonstrate
that one can adiabatically move from the N´eel phase to the FM
phase. Therefore, it will be highly interesting to examine the
thermodynamics of the HK Hamiltonian plus a Zeeman term
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. Thus far we believe that our
experimental works demonstrated that there is more for future
developments, which could offer much better understandings
on the magnetism of honeycomb lattice systems with any
spin S.
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
In summary, we have investigated a Li2MnO3 single crystal
as a test bed for the physics of magnetism in honeycomb
lattice at the weak SOC limit as it offers a honeycomb lattice
for Mn4+ ions with spin S = 3/2. Li2MnO3 has a classical
N´eel ordered Cxz-type antiferromagnetic spin structure (2u
symmetry). The reﬁned resultant magnetic moment per Mn4+
ion is μordࣈ2.29(1) μB, reduced from the spin-only ionic
value (3 μB) probably because of the two-dimensional nature
of the honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, we have studied high
ﬁeld magnetization of a Li2MnO3 single crystal for magnetic
ﬁelds up to 35 T applied both parallel and perpendicular to
the ab planes. Li2MnO3 is seen to exhibit two successive
magnetic ﬁeld induced spin-ﬂop phase transitions at T < TN.
A magnetic phase diagram of a Li2MnO3 single crystal
has been constructed using the high ﬁeld- and temperature-
dependent magnetization data. The spin-ﬂop phase transition
and the other magnetization properties of a Li2MnO3 single
crystal can be well described by a honeycomb lattice system
with an effective spin S = 1 model based on a simple
Heisenberg exchange interaction Hamiltonian with a single
ion anisotropy term. In the mean-ﬁeld analysis, the spin-ﬂop
transition has been found to occur in two successive ﬁrst-
order phase transitions at lower temperatures; surprisingly,
the interlayer coupling plays an essential role in the spin-ﬂop
transition. This agrees with the two hysteresis loops observed
in our M vs H data.
