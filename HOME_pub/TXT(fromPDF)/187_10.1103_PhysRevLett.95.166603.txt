The interaction of the electron spin with local elastic twists due to transverse phonons is studied. The
universal dependence of the spin-relaxation rate on the strength and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is
obtained in terms of the electron gyromagnetic tensor and macroscopic elastic constants of the solid. The
theory contains no unknown parameters and it can be easily tested in experiment. At high magnetic ﬁeld it
provides a parameter-free lower bound on the electron spin relaxation in quantum dots.

The relaxation of the electron spin in solids is a funda-
mental problem that has important applications. Among
them are electron spin resonance and quantum computing.
In a semiconductor quantum dot the relaxation time for the
electron spin is determined by its interaction with phonons,
nuclear spins, impurities, etc. While impurities and nuclear
spins can, in principle, be eliminated, the interaction with
phonons cannot. Thus, spin-phonon interactions provide
the most fundamental upper bound on the lifetime of
electron spin states. The existing methods of computing
electron spin-phonon rates in semiconductors rely upon
phenomenological models of spin-orbit interaction; see,
e.g., Refs. [1–10]. These models contain unknown con-
stants that must be obtained from experiment. In the mean-
time, as was noticed more than 50 years ago by Elliot [11]
(see also Ref. [12]), the spin-orbit coupling in semicon-
ductors determines the difference of the electron g factor
from the free electron value of g0  2:0023. The question
then arises whether the effect of the spin-orbit coupling on
spin-phonon relaxation can be expressed via the difference
between the electron gyromagnetic tensor g (;  
x; y; z) and the vacuum tensor g0. Since g can be
measured independently, this would enable one to compare
the computed relaxation rates with experiment without any
ﬁtting parameters. In this Letter we show that this, indeed,
can
be
done
under
certain
reasonable
simplifying
assumptions.
The Zeeman interaction of the electron with an external
magnetic ﬁeld, B, is given by the Hamiltonian
^H Z  BgsB;
(1)
where B is the Bohr magneton and s  =2 is the di-
mensionless electron spin, with  being Pauli matrices.
One can choose the axes of the coordinate system along the
principal axes of the tensor g. Then g is diagonal,
g  g;
(2)
represented by three numbers, gx, gy, and gz, that can be
directly measured. Perturbation of Eq. (1) by phonons has
been studied in the past [3,4,6] by writing all terms of the
expansion of g on the strain tensor, u, permitted by
symmetry. This gives spin-phonon interaction of the form
AuB with unknown coefﬁcients A. To
avoid this uncertainty, we limit our consideration to local
rotations generated by transverse phonons. The argument
for doing this is threefold. First, the rate of the transition
accompanied by the emission or absorption of a phonon is
inversely proportional to the ﬁfth power of the sound
velocity [13]. Since the velocity of the transverse sound
is always smaller than the velocity of the longitudinal
sound [14], the transverse phonons must dominate the
transitions. Second, for a dot that is sufﬁciently rigid to
permit only tiny local rotations as a whole under an arbi-
trary elastic deformation, the emission or absorption of a
quantum of the elastic twist will be the only spin-phonon
relaxation mode. Third, we notice that interaction of the
electron spin with a local elastic twist generated by a
transverse phonon does not contain any unknown con-
stants. Consequently, it gives a parameter-free lower bound
on the electron spin-relaxation rate.
The angle of the local rotation of the crystal lattice in the
presence of the deformation, ur, is given by [14]
  1
2 r  u;
(3)
and the local angular velocity is  _. The analysis of the
effect of the rotation on the electron spin can be done in the
coordinate frame that is rigidly coupled to the crystal
lattice. In that coordinate frame the effect of the rotation
is twofold. First, it results in the opposite rotation of the
external magnetic ﬁeld felt by the spin. The correspond-
ing perturbation of the magnetic ﬁeld is given by B 
B  . Second, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame
acquires a kinematic term @s   _. The spin-phonon
interaction in the lattice frame (marked by prime) is then
given by

For the theory to be valid, !0 of Eq. (23) should not
exceed !D, otherwise there will be no acoustic phonons
responsible for the discussed spin-phonon relaxation
mechanism. If g are of order unity, this is equivalent to
the condition that the factor BB=@vt in Eq. (36), which
has the dimensionality of the wave vector, is less than the
Debye wave vector, kD  !D=vt, for transverse phonons.
This condition is almost always satisﬁed in the experimen-
tally accessible ﬁeld range. At @!0  kBT, the coth factor

A nice property of the spin-relaxation mechanism
studied above is its universal dependence on the strength

166603-3relaxation at high ﬁelds. For example, for   5 g=cm3
and vt  2  105 cm=s, it gives   3  104 s1 FTn at
B  10 T. The dependence of the rate on the direction of
the ﬁeld, FTn, is entirely determined by the difference
between principal values of the tensor g. Highly aniso-
tropic g has been theoretically predicted in two-
dimensional systems [15] and experimentally detected in
GaAs quantum wells [16]. In the mK temperature range,
the spin-relaxation times of order 100 s have been ob-
served [17] in GaAs electron quantum dots in the ﬁeld of
order 10 T.
It should be noted that low-temperature spin-relaxation
rates,  / B=vl5 due to longitudinal phonons and  /
B=vt5 due to transverse phonons, have been known be-
fore (see, e.g., Ref. [5], and references therein). They have
been obtained within models that employ various types of
spin-orbit interaction for an electron characterized by a
single scalar g factor. Comparison with our results is
difﬁcult because these models are speciﬁc to a 2D GaAs
quantum dot and, in addition, they contain poorly known
phenomenological constants. On the contrary, the spin-
relaxation rate due to local rotations, which is given by
Eqs. (36)–(39), does not contain any unknown interaction
constants, nor does it depend on the material or dimension-
ality of the dot or on any speciﬁcs of the spin-orbit and
spin-phonon interaction (such as, e.g., the model of inter-
action of the electron spin with ‘‘piezophonons’’ assumed
for GaAs in Refs. [5,9]). In our theory all poorly known
mechanisms of spin-orbit interaction are absorbed into the
anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor. The latter can be
measured directly, thus providing the possibility of a de-
tailed comparison between theory and experiment for the
proposed mechanism of relaxation. Note also that B=vt5
is large compared to B=vl5 due to the condition vt < vl.
Consequently, parameter-independent effects of local ro-
tations should be the dominant source of relaxation of the
electron spin at high ﬁelds.
In conclusion, we have studied electron spin relaxation
in quantum dots due to local rotations generated by trans-
verse phonons. This is an unavoidable relaxation channel
that occurs when the electron gyromagnetic tensor g is
anisotropic. It must dominate spin relaxation at high mag-
netic ﬁelds. The advantage of our theory is that it expresses
the effect of unknown spin-orbit interactions on electron
spin relaxation in terms of the tensor g alone. The
corresponding relaxation rate has universal dependence
on the strength and direction of the ﬁeld with respect to
the principal axes of g. The important feature of the
proposed mechanism is that it does not involve any un-
known constants of the quantum dot and is entirely deter-
mined by the three principal values of g, which can be
independently measured. This allows a simple experimen-
tal test of the proposed theory.
