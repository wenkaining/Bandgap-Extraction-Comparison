As silicon is the basis of conventional electronics, so strontium tita-
nate (SrTiO3) is the foundation of the emerging field of oxide elec-
tronics1,2. SrTiO3 is the preferred template for the creation of exotic,
two-dimensional(2D)phasesofelectronmatteratoxideinterfaces3–5
that have metal–insulator transitions6,7, superconductivity8,9 or large
negative magnetoresistance10. However, the physical nature of the
electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs),
which is crucial to understanding their remarkable properties11,12,
remains elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the
vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3 (including the non-doped insu-
lating material) independently of bulk carrier densities over more
than seven decades. This 2DEG is confined within a region of about
five unit cells and has a sheet carrier density of
0.33 electrons per
square lattice parameter. The electronic structure consists of mul-
tiple subbands of heavy and light electrons. The similarity of this
2DEG to those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures6,8,13 and
field-effect transistors9,14 suggests that different forms of electron
confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same
2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the
electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices and a novel
means of generating 2DEGs at the surfaces of transition-metal oxides.
In the cubic phase, stoichiometric SrTiO3 has an empty t2g conduc-
tion manifold composed of three dispersive, three-dimensional (3D)
bands that are degenerate at the C point15. As schematically shown in
Fig. 1a, its band structure along one direction, say ky, consists of a
weaklydispersive (heavy-mass) bandand a pair of degenerate, strongly
dispersive (light-mass) bands. They arise respectively from the small
and large overlaps, along the y axis, of neighbouring titanium 3dxz, 3dxy
and 3dyz orbitals, as depicted in Fig. 1b for the 3dxy orbitals. Thus, the
dxy-like band will be light in the x–y plane and heavy along the z axis,
whereas the dyz band will be heavy along x and light in the y–z plane,
and the dxz band will be heavy along y and light in the x–z plane. The
resulting three Fermi surface sheets, projected on the x–y plane of the
sample surface, are shown in Fig. 1c for several bulk dopings.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful
technique for probing the electronic structure of materials. Previous
work using ARPES addressed the bulk electronic structure of doped
SrTiO3, revealing dispersing quasiparticle peaks and in-gap features,
and discussing possible polaronic effects near the Fermi energy, EF (refs
16–19).Asweshallsee,ourARPES datadonotconformtotheexpected
lightly doped bulk band picture, but reveal that a novel 2DEG with a
complex subband structure, shown schematically in Fig. 1e, is realized
at the low-temperature vacuum-cleaved surface of this material.
Crucial to our discoveries is the comparison of samples with very dif-
ferent bulk carrier densities of n3D,1013cm23 (essentially non-doped),
n3D <1018cm–3(lowdoping)andn3D< 1020cm23(highdoping),deter-
minedbybulk-sensitivetechniques(SupplementaryInformation,section
II). The large difference in doping is apparent even by inspection of the
samples (Fig. 2a–c): whereas the non-doped sample is transparent, the
highly doped sample is black and shiny.
Our first observation (Fig. 2d) is that even for the transparent, non-
doped sample (Fig. 2a), for which no bulk bands at EF are expected, the
cleaved surface yields intense, strongly dispersive bands across the
Fermi level. They correspond to a large density of mobile carriers
(see below), ensuring that, despite the electron emission, there is no
charging of the surface of this otherwise highly insulating sample in the
bulk. Equally notable is the fact (Fig. 2d–f) that for all the bulk dopings
studied, the electronic states around EF, and in particular the
bandwidths (EF minus the band bottom) and Fermi momenta, kF, of
the observed bands, are essentially identical. All these observations
contrast sharply with the large differences that would be expected from
electron-doping in the bulk (Fig. 1c), where the 3D density of carriers
scales as kF
3. The immediate conclusion is that the observed bands
correspond to 2D states (see also Supplementary Information, section
III).
The spectra in Fig. 2d–f, measured around C102 and C012 (points
such as B in Fig. 2j), clearly show two strongly dispersing bands,
termedupper and lower parabolic bands. In Fig. 2g–i, twoother weakly
dispersing bands, termed upper and lower shallow bands, are revealed
either by rotating the light polarization to be at right angles with
respect to the measurement direction, as illustrated for the non-doped
sample in Fig. 2g, or by measuring around a C point at a larger emis-
sion angle in a different Brillouin zone (C112, or point C in Fig. 2j), as
shown for the low-doped sample in Fig. 2h, i. We note furthermore,
from Fig. 2d, g, that the changes in light polarization affect the two
strongly dispersing parabolic bands differently, completely suppres-
sing the upper parabolic band in Fig. 2g, whereas the increase in
emission angle (compare Fig. 2e with Fig. 2h, i) enhances in the same
asymmetric way the negative-k intensities of the two shallow bands
and weakens the parabolic bands. These dichroic effects, which are due
to dipole transition selection rules17, unambiguously show that the two
parabolic bands have different symmetries, which are also different
from a third symmetry common to the two shallow subbands (see also
Supplementary Information,sectionIV). This means that theobserved
2D bands are organized by their orbital symmetries.

©2011their symmetry characters, discussed further below. We note that this
band structure agrees with the one depicted in Fig. 1e.
We now quantitatively analyse the observed band structure. The
upper and lower parabolic bands have bandwidthsof 210 and 100 meV
and Fermi momenta of 0.21 and 0.13 A˚ 21 (best seen in Fig. 3), respec-
tively. Thus, they correspond to light carriers with effective masses
my* < 0.7me along ky (me is the free electron mass). The upper shallow
band (Figs 2g, h and 3) has a bandwidth of 40 meV and a Fermi
momentum of kF < 0.3–0.4 A˚ 21, corresponding to heavy carriers with
my* < 10me–20me. The lower shallow band (Figs 2i and 3) disperses
from about 2160 meV at C to about 2120 meV at the Brillouin zone
boundary, and is thus fully occupied. All the above figures differ by less
than 10% across all the studied dopings.
As shown in Fig. 4, the resulting Fermi surface consists of a circle of
radius 0.21 A˚ 21 and two ellipsoids, along kx and ky, with semi-axes of
0.13 and 0.3–0.4 A˚ 21, respectively. From the area, AF, enclosed by each
Fermi surface, the corresponding 2D carrier density is n2D 5 AF/2p2.
Accounting for the three bands that cross EF, we find 0.33 6 0.03
electrons per a2 (or about 23 1014 cm22), where a is the cubic lattice
parameter.
We now rationalize the observed electronic states as the subbands of
a 2DEG confined within a few unit cells at the surface of SrTiO3. To
this end, we consider a potential, V0, at the surface that confines the
electronic motion along z (Fig. 1d, inset). This lowers the energy of the
bands by about V0, similar to the ‘band bending’ in semiconductor
heterostructures, and produces an energy splitting between the differ-
ent eigenstates that is inversely proportional to their effective masses
along z (mz*). The resulting subband structure, depicted in Fig. 1d,
consists on a single dxy-like band and two dxz/dyz bands that are degen-
erate at C. As the dxy band has a very large mz*, the attractive confining
potential will merely pull it below EF (its energy-split eigenstates will
have a negligible separation). Thus, we identify this band with the
lower parabolic band in our spectra of Fig. 2, and denote it E1(dxy).
By contrast, the dxz and dyz subbands, which are light along z, will show
large energy splittings. They are noted En(dxz/yz) (n 5 1, 2, …) in
Fig. 1d.
Other effects beyond this simplified analysis, such as spin–orbit
coupling (which has been reported at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface20)
and/or the low-temperature tetragonal and possibly orthorhombic dis-
tortions21,22, canliftthe degeneracy between the dxz and dyzsubbands, as
illustrated in Fig. 1e. This would induce a coupling, resulting in hybrid-
ization between the light and heavy subbands, as indeed evidenced by
our data for the lower parabolic band and the shallow bands (Fig. 3,
linear vertical polarization). Another possibility would be a surface
reconstruction,althoughthisisnotsuggestedbyourdata,whichfollows

©2011band folding. Resolving the detailed origin of such a degeneracy lift,
which isnot relevanttothediscoveries reported here, willrequire future
investigations.Hence, weidentify the lower shallowband and the upper
parabolic band in our spectra (Fig. 2) with the components of the split
doublet E1(dxz) and E1(dyz), respectively. From the data, the doublet
splittingisD < 60meV.Wefinallyidentifytheuppershallowbandwith
E2(dxz). Given that the bottom of this band is at 240meV, its upper
partner, E2(dyz), would occur at about 120meV and cannot be
observed.
This subband hierarchy respects the symmetry considerations
previously deduced from the effects of light polarization and emission
angle, rendering additional support to the picture of a confined 2DEG.
To characterize this 2DEG quantitatively, we use a simple schematic
model. We assume that the surface has a homogeneous, positive
charge density, generating a confining electric field, F, inside the solid
and, thus, a triangular wedge potential of depth V0 at the surface
(z 5 0) and value V(z) 5 2V0 1 eFz (e, elementary charge) along z,
as depicted in the inset of Fig. 1d. The details of the calculations are
presented in Supplementary Information (section VI). From the
experimental splitting, E2(dxz) 2 E1(dxz) 5 120 meV, between the first
two subbands of the dxz orbitals, and their light mass, mz* < 0.7me,
along z, we deduce a strong confining field F < 83 MV m21. From
E1(dxy), the confining potential is estimated to be V0 < 2260meV.
The deduced values of V0 and F, and the measured effective masses
and doublet splitting of 60 meV between the dxz and dyz subbands,
suffice for the calculation of all the observed subband energies. The
width, L, of the confined 2DEG results from the spatial extension of the
highest occupied state, E2(dxz), or, independently, from the approximate
expression eFL< E2(dxz) 2 E1(dxz) (Fig. 1d, inset), yielding consistent
valuesintherangeL < 14.5–18 A˚,or,4–5unitcells.Additionally,from
the confining field, F, and the polarizability of the medium, we calculate
an induced surface charge density of ,0.25 electrons per a2, consistent
with the experimental value.
The band bending due to confinement should induce an energy
downshift of the oxygen 2p valence band of about V0, creating a gap
with respect to EF that is larger than the optical gap. This effect,

©2011observed in our data (Supplementary Information, section V), was
previously reported and studied in ref. 17, where it was demonstrated
that when the cleaved surface of SrTiO3 is exposed to oxygen, the
oxygen 2p valence band shifts by about 200 meV towards EF and the
quasiparticle peak at EF, which corresponds to our 2DEG, disappears.
Surface oxygen vacancies therefore seem to be the most reasonable
candidates to explain the origin of the 2DEG observed in our experi-
ments. In fact, cleaving (or fracturing) is likely to produce a massive
removal of surface oxygen, much larger than and basically independ-
ent of the bulk concentration of vacancies, providing two dopant elec-
trons per created vacancy. These two electrons will delocalize within
the potential wedge created by the positively charged layer of surface
vacancies. We note that fracturing this almost cubic oxide system
necessitates overcoming the strong binding electric forces between
atoms, which is equivalent to inducing a ‘mechanical dielectric break-
down’. According to our data analysis, the large electric field generated
at the surface of SrTiO3 is of the order of typical dielectric breakdown
fields23, and is thus compatible with a cleaved surface in this material.
To give additional support to our picture and data analyses, we
performed ab initio calculations including oxygen vacancies at the sur-
face. The results, presented in the Supplementary Information (section
VII),areconsistentwiththeabovesimplifiedwedge-potentialmodelfor
the two types (TiO2 and SrO) of possible surface termination.
Strikingly, the sheet carrier density, the confinement size, the con-
fining field, F, and potential, V0, and the presence of both mobile and
quasi-localized carriers in this novel electron gas at the surface of
SrTiO3 compare well with the characteristics of other 2DEGs at dif-
ferent types of SrTiO3 interface6,8,9,12,13,24–27. Furthermore, our experi-
ments directly show the emergence, at the surface of SrTiO3, of a
metallic subband structure where the titanium 3dxy states of light
carriers become the first available levels. This situation is similar to
that reported in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces28. These remarkable con-
sistencies suggest that all these 2DEGs may be understood on a com-
mon basis. In particular, we note that fundamentally different electron
confinement mechanisms, such as the electric field created by a polar
LaAlO3 layer6, the direct application of an electric field9 or the charge
leakage between a Mott insulator and a band insulator11, would recre-
ate a 2DEG confined within a nanometric layer of SrTiO3 with a
subband electronic structure similar in nature to that revealed by
our measurements.
Our discoveries demonstrate that a highly mobile 2DEG can be read-
ily obtainedwithoutany elaborate interfacepreparation atthesurface of
SrTiO3, even in the case of the non-doped 3 eV bandgap insulator. This
2DEG is thus decoupled from thesea ofbulkelectrons,and constitutes a
model system for fundamental and applied research in oxide surfaces/
interfaces. An exciting perspective is that other hard-to-cleave complex
oxides with multifunctional behaviour, such as multiferroics, ferroelec-
trics or manganites, might realize similar 2DEGs that inherit the func-
tionalities of the bulk material. Candidates to study in this regard would
be other titanates, such as the ferroelectric BaTiO3 or the Mott–
Hubbard insulator LaTiO3. The properties of such 2DEGs might be
tailored by surface doping with either electron-donor or -acceptor
species, something that is not always feasible in the bulk, opening a
window to explore new phenomena. This simple approach has been
applied successfully to tune the density of states in, for example, the
surface states of topological insulators29. Our discoveries also raise the
appealingpossibilitythat oxygen vacancies may beinduced to aggregate
orself-organizeatthesurfacesorinterfacesofSrTiO3orotheroxides—a
situation that might be at the origin of the reversible patterning of
conducting nano-lines in LaAlO3/SrTiO3
2,7,30. More generally, we
suggest that the nano-engineering of atomic vacancies at the
surfaces of transition-metal oxides could provide model systems for
low-dimensional, confined electron gases, opening a new avenue in
correlated-electron surface science.
METHODS SUMMARY
High-quality, singlecrystals ofSrTiO3 doped with oxygenvacancies(except forthe
non-doped sample) were measured throughout this work. The ARPES experi-
ments were done at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (University of
Wisconsin-Madison) and at the Synchrotron SOLEIL (France), using different
photon energies, intensities, polarizations and measurement geometries. In all
cases, the angular and energy resolutions were 0.25u and 20 meV, respectively.
The samples were fractured in situ along the c axis below 20 K at a pressure lower
than 63 10211 torr. Using calibrated photodiodes, we checked that the beam
intensity per unit area at the same photon energy differs by at least one decade
between the two synchrotrons. As the observed 2DEG is identical in both cases,
this indicates that its subbands are not significantly populated by photo-carrier
injection. The results have been reproduced in at least two samples for each bulk
doping. The methods associated with this work are detailed in Methods and
Supplementary Information.

geometry used (Supplementary Information, section IV), Fermi surface sheets
of different orbital characters are more intense in different Brillouin zones.

Sample preparation and measurement technique. High-quality, single crystals
of SrTiO3 were doped with oxygen vacancies by high temperature treatmentin low
oxygen pressure, except for the non-doped sample, which was a bare SrTiO3
substrate measured without any previous preparation. The bulk carrier concen-
trations were deduced from Hall and resistivity measurements (Supplementary
Information, section II).
The ARPES experiments were done at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC,
University of Wisconsin-Madison) and at the Synchrotron SOLEIL (France),
using 47 eV (SRC) and 45 eV (SOLEIL) linearly polarized photons, a Scienta
2002 detector with horizontal slits for the highly doped sample (SRC), and a
Scienta R4000 with vertical slits for the low-doped (SRC) and non-doped
(SOLEIL) samples. The above photon energies, close to resonant photoemission
at the titanium 3p–3d edge, yield intense quasiparticle peaks in SrTiO3 (ref. 17).
The momentum and energy resolutions were 0.25u and 20 meV, respectively. The
mean diameter of the incident photon beam was less than 50 mm at the
Synchrotron SOLEIL and about 300 mm at the SRC. We checked, using calibrated
photodiodes, that the photon beam intensity per unit area at the above photon
energies differs by at least one order of magnitude between SOLEIL and the SRC.
As the observed subbands are the same in both cases, this indicates that the 2DEG
is the intrinsic stable state of the ultrahigh-vacuum fractured surface of SrTiO3,
and that its subbands are not significantly populated by photo-carrier injection.
The samples were fractured in situ along the c axis at 20 K (SRC) or 10 K
(SOLEIL), at a pressure lower than 63 10211torr. After fracturing, one narrow,
highly emitting region was selected and kept fixed for each set of measurements.
Supplementary Information (section I) presentsdetails of the fracturing procedure
and a discussion of the surface terminations in relation to the data shown here.
The Fermi momenta and bandwidths were determined from the peak positions
of the momentum distribution curves at E 5 0 and the energy distribution curves
at k 5 0, respectively.
The results have been reproduced in at least two samples for each bulk doping.
Measurement geometries. The sample’s surface defines the x–y plane. The crys-
tals were oriented using Laue diffraction and mounted with the (010) axis along
the angle-resolved direction of the detector, defining the ky direction. The photon
energyfixes the radius ofthek-space hemisphere for the measurements, whichwas
,3.8A˚ 21 (or about 0.7p/a above C002) for SrTiO3 at photon energies around
47 eV (refs 17, 18). The data in Figs 2d, g and 3 were collected from B-like points
slightly above C102, with the photon polarization along y (LV) in Fig. 2d and in the
x–z plane (LH) in Fig. 2h. The data in Figs 2e, f correspond to B-like points slightly
above C012 and those in Figs 2h, i correspond to C-like points slightly below C112.
For these points, the photon polarization is not parallel to any of the sample’s
symmetry directions or planes, and the spectra have different symmetry mixtures.
The data in Fig. 4 were collected with LH photon polarization. Supplementary
Information (section IV) discusses further the measurement geometries and their
corresponding dipole selection rules.
