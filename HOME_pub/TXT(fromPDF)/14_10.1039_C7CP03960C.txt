The van der Waals heterostructures of allotropes of phosphorene (a- and b-P) with MoSe2 (H-, T-, ZT-
and SO-MoSe2) are investigated in the framework of state-of-the-art density functional theory. The
semiconducting heterostructures, b-P/H-MoSe2 and a-P/H-MoSe2, form anti-type structures with type I
and type II band alignments, respectively, whose bands are tunable with an external electric field.
a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2 form ohmic semiconductor–metal contacts while the Schottky barrier
in b-P/T-MoSe2 can be reduced to zero by an external electric field to form ohmic contacts which is
useful to realize high-performance devices. Simulated STM images of the given heterostructures reveal
that a-P can be used as a capping layer to differentiate between various allotropes of underlying MoSe2.
The dielectric response of the considered heterostructures is highly anisotropic in terms of lateral and
vertical polarization. The tunable electronic and dielectric response of van der Waals phosphorene/MoSe2
heterostructures may find potential applications in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Phosphorene with its semiconducting nature is a newly
included member in the family of two dimensional (2D) materials
and is a potential candidate for nano- and opto-electronic
applications due to its exceptional properties such as strong
structural anisotropy, high mechanical strength, large lateral
flexibility and high conductivity.1,2 Black phosphorene (a-P)
exhibits a puckered structure,3 whereas blue phosphorene
(b-P) possesses a graphene-like honeycomb structure of phos-
phorous atoms.4 Both a- and b-P are semiconductors with a
band gap of B1 eV and B2 eV, respectively.4,5 Transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) are another family of 2D materials6
with tunable electronic and dielectric properties.7–9 The mono-
layers of TMDs are triatomic, in which the metal atoms are
sandwiched between two atomic planes of chalcogen atoms.
MoS2 is a prototype material which is the most explored among
the TMDs.10
Monolayer MoSe2 is also emerging as a novel contender in
electronic applications similar to MoS2 with the fabrication of
few-layer MoSe2 based FETs having Ni and Ti electrode contacts
possessing a field-eﬀect mobility of 150–200 cm2 V1 s1 and a
current on/off ratio up to 106.11,12 The layered crystal structure
of MoSe2 is found to exhibit two phases i.e., the trigonal
prismatic phase (H-MoSe2) and octahedral coordinated phase
(T-MoSe2), with 3 atoms in a hexagonal unit cell. The Se atoms
lie directly above one another in H-MoSe2, while they are
displaced in the case of T-MoSe2. Another stable allotrope of
MoSe2 can be formed by repeating square octagon pairs in a
square unit cell, which consists of 12 atoms per unit cell.13
The absence of dangling bonds in 2D materials makes it
possible to reassemble the layers of these materials to form van
der Waals heterostructures.14–17 This layer by layer structure
formed by the combination of two or more different materials
preserves the properties of these materials without much
degradation and in addition exhibits some unusual phenomena
too.18,19 The phosphorene based heterostructures have been
used to develop novel devices for nanoelectronic applications
in the recent past, e.g. STM images of h-BN/phosphorene hetero-
structures with h-BN as a capping layer are useful to distinguish
between different structural phases of phosphorene;20 phos-
phorene/MoS2 acts as a CMOS inverter21 with possible use as a
channel material for electronic applications;22 phosphorene/
graphene heterostructures display potential applications as
electrode materials for batteries;23 metal/black-phosphorene
heterostructures such as Zn/BP and In/BP form Schottky con-
tacts while Cu/BP forms ohmic contacts24 in devices. Similarly,
heterostructures based on MoSe2 are also found to be suitable
for device applications such as the MoSe2/graphene heterostruc-
tures that show rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers

between MoSe2 and graphene which depicts their possible
applications in optoelectronics;25 black phosphorene/MoSe2
heterostructures show potential applications in p–n diodes and
logic devices;26 etc.
In the present work, we construct novel commensurable
heterostructures of black and blue phosphorene with various
phases of monolayer MoSe2 which show variable electronic
structures due to the influence of an external electric field.
Mechanical properties and simulated STM images of the given
heterostructures are also investigated. The obtained dielectric
response is highly dependent on the direction of polarization.
2. Computational methods
The SIESTA simulation package has been used to perform all
the calculations.27 The fully separable Kleinman and Bylander
form of the norm-conserving Troullier Martin pseudopotential
has been used to treat the electron–ion interactions.28 The van
der Waals (vdW)-DRSLL functional has been employed in the
present work to treat the exchange and correlation energies.29
The Kohn Sham orbitals are expanded as a linear combination
of numerical pseudo atomic orbitals using a split-valence double
zeta basis set with polarization functions (DZP). Throughout
geometry optimization, the confinement energy of the numerical
pseudo-atomic orbitals is taken as 0.01 Ry. Minimization of
energy was carried out using the standard conjugate-gradient
(CG) technique. Structures were relaxed until the forces on each
atom were less than 0.01 eV Å1. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme is
used to sample the Brillouin zone with a 10  10  1 mesh for
the calculations based on hetero-bilayers and a 30  30  1
mesh for homo-bilayers. The spacing of the real space used to
calculate the Hartree exchange and correlation contribution of
the total energy and Hamiltonian was 450 Ry. A vacuum region
of about 20 Å perpendicular to the 2D plane has been used in
calculations to prevent the superficial interactions between the
periodic images. The dielectric properties have been investigated
by calculating the dipolar transition matrix elements between
the occupied and unoccupied single-electron eigenstates by
means of first order time-dependent perturbation theory as
implemented in SIESTA.27 The static dielectric constant (es)
was calculated as the value of the real part of the dielectric
function at zero frequency, while electron energy loss spectra
(EELS) were obtained from dielectric functions (e1 and e2) using
the formula:

3. Results and discussion
The commensurable vertical heterostructures of two phosphorene
allotropes, namely a-P and b-P, are constructed with four phases
of MoSe2, namely hexagonal (H-MoSe2), tetragonal (T-MoSe2),
distorted tetragonal (ZT-MoSe2) and square octagon (SO-MoSe2)
(Fig. 1). Note that the ZT-phase of MoSe2 is the distorted phase
which is obtained after full structural optimization of the
rectangular unit cell of T-MoSe2 (Fig. S1 of the ESI†), which is
found to be stable in previous studies on MoS2.30 Our calcula-
tions reveal that ZT-MoSe2 is energetically favorable over
T-MoSe2 with an energy diﬀerence of 0.17 eV per atom.
The supercells of the vertical heterostructures are chosen so
that the lattice mismatch between the layers gets minimized
e.g., a-P/H-MoSe2 consists of 1  5 unit cells of a-P stacked
vertically over 1  4 unit cells of H-MoSe2, which leads to a
minimum lattice mismatch of 3.2%. The lattice mismatch in
the other heterostructures is calculated as 1.16%, 6.7%, 1.08%
and 0.98% for a-P/ZT-MoSe2, a-P/SO-MoSe2, b-P/H-MoSe2 and
b-P/T-MoSe2, respectively. The equilibrium interlayer distance
is obtained as 3.8 Å, 3.6 Å, 3.7 Å, 3.8 Å and 3.5 Å for a-P/H-MoSe2,
a-P/ZT-MoSe2, a-P/SO-MoSe2, b-P/H-MoSe2 and b-P/T-MoSe2,
respectively. The binding energy per atom in these heterostruc-
tures is calculated to be a few meV (B40 meV) which shows weak
van der Waals interactions in the considered heterostructures.
Note that the binding energy is obtained as EB = |E  (E1  E2)|/N,
where E is the total energy of the heterostructures, E1 and E2 are
the energies of the isolated individual layers of the heterostruc-
tures and N is the number of atoms in the heterostructures.
3.1
Electronic structure
a-P displays a direct band gap of 1.12 eV while b-P has an
indirect band gap of 2.05 eV (Table 1). H-MoSe2 is a semicon-
ductor with a direct band gap of about 1.13 eV while T-MoSe2,
ZT-MoSe2 and SO-MoSe2 are zero band gap materials. Note that
the standard Kohn–Sham band gap underestimates the funda-
mental gap due to the approximate nature of the exchange–
correlation functional. The band gap calculated with quasiparticle
GW calculations in other reports31–33 is E1.0 eV higher than that
of the Kohn–Sham value for monolayer black phosphorene and
MoSe2. Therefore, it should be noted that the results presented
here represent the qualitative picture of the electronic band
structure. ZT-MoSe2 and SO-MoSe2 have been found to exhibit a
Dirac-cone like feature at the Fermi level which arises due to the
4p orbitals of Se in ZT-MoSe2 and 4d-orbitals of Mo in the case of
SO-MoSe2 (Fig. S2 of the ESI†).
We found that a-P/H-MoSe2 and b-P/H-MoSe2 are semicon-
ductors with a band gap of 0.7 eV and 1.1 eV, respectively, the
former exhibiting an indirect gap while the latter has a direct
band gap. In a-P/H-MoSe2, the valance band maximum (VBM)
is mainly contributed by the 3p orbitals of P atoms whereas the
conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly composed of the
4d-orbitals of Mo. In the case of b-P/H-MoSe2, both the VBM
and CBM are mainly contributed by the 4d-orbitals of Mo
(Fig. 2). On the other hand, the rest of the three hetero-
structures i.e., a-P/ZT-MoSe2, a-P/SO-MoSe2 and b-P/T-MoSe2,
are found to be zero-gap materials (Fig. 2). On comparing the
electronic structure of a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2 with
their monolayer counterparts, the Dirac-cone like feature is
found to remain intact at the Fermi level while the P-bands
shift upward. In b-P/T-MoSe2, the bands at the Fermi level,
which arise due to T-MoSe2, remain unaltered but the b-P
bands show downward shift (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 of ESI†). In all
the heterostructures, the majority of the contribution to the

total density of states around the Fermi level comes from the
4d, 4p and 3p orbitals of Mo, Se and P, respectively (Fig. S3 of
the ESI†). In order to gain further insight into the electronic
structure, the charge density diﬀerence profile was obtained,
which shows the accumulation of charge in the van der Waals
gap that leads to reduction of the energy gap due to interlayer
interactions (Fig. 2) as compared to the higher band gap in the
constituent semiconducting monolayers. Note that the charge
density diﬀerence is calculated as Dr = r  (r1  r2), where r is
the charge density of the heterostructure, and r1 and r2 are the
charge densities of the isolated monolayers.
3.2
Band alignment
We found that p-type phosphorene and n-type H-MoSe2 form
an anti-type heterostructure with type I and type II band
alignments for b-P/H-MoSe2 and a-P/H-MoSe2, respectively
(Fig. 3). The type II heterostructures are ideal for solar energy
conversion and optoelectronic applications since the free elec-
trons and holes get instinctively separated.22 There is a small
amount of band bending as one moves from the region where
the phosphorene and MoSe2 layers are stacked to the region
where only pristine phosphorene is present. Note that band
bending is obtained as the diﬀerence between the work
functions of the composed system (W) and the pristine layer
(Ws): DEF = W  Ws. The magnitude of band bending in
a-P/H-MoSe2 is found to be 0.17 eV for a-P and 0.11 eV for
H-MoSe2 while its magnitude in b-P/H-MoSe2 is found to be
0.07 eV and 0.43 eV for b-P and H-MoSe2, respectively. Similarly,
the values of band bending for the phosphorene layer in
a-P/ZT-MoSe2, a-P/SO-MoSe2 and b-P/T-MoSe2 are 0.53 eV,
0.60 eV and 0.62 eV, respectively (Fig. 3). Since DEF 4 0 for
a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2, electrons will be transferred
from phosphorene to MoSe2 making it a p-type channel while for
b-P/T-MoSe2 the semiconductor–metal contact is n-type due to
negative band bending. Note that when two layers with different
work functions come in contact with each other, the charge
redistribution and band bending occur to equalize the work func-
tions between the layers. Also in the case of vertical heterostructures,
the weak interlayer coupling results in the change in band positions
of the constituent monolayers in the heterostructures.
It is important here to discuss the Schottky Barrier Height
(SBH) for the semiconductor–metal heterostructures if we
consider MoSe2 as a metal contact and phosphorene as the
channel material for device applications. The Schottky barrier
in a semiconductor–metal junction is the excitation energy
of electrons from the metal to semiconductor or vice versa.

For p-type semiconductors, the Schottky barrier is defined as
the difference between the Fermi level and the valance band
edge of the semiconductor and for n-type materials it is the
difference between the conduction band edge of the semicon-
ductor and the Fermi level. In a-P/ZT-MoSe2, a-P/SO-MoSe2 and
b-P/T-MoSe2, the SBH is calculated as 0 eV, 0 eV and 0.5 eV,
respectively.
Hence,
two
of
the
heterostructures
namely
a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2 result in an ohmic contact.
Hence, all three of our semiconductor–metal contacts owning a
very low Schottky barrier height, if employed for practical
applications, can be proved to greatly enhance the drive current
of the device. The Schottky Barrier is p-type for a-P/ZT-MoSe2
and a-P/SO-MoSe2 since the valance band is closer to the Dirac
point while it is n-type for b-P/T-MoSe2 (Fig. 2).
3.3
Eﬀect of the external electric field
Upon applying a perpendicular electric field in the range
1 V Å1, the semiconducting heterostructures show reduction
in the band gap, however, change in the band gap depends
strongly on the polarity of the field e.g. a positive field reduces
the bandgap sharply leading to a transition from semiconductor to
metal at E> = 0.5 V Å1 in a-P/H-MoSe2 while a negative field firstly
increases the band gap to a maximum value at E> = 0.2 V Å1 and
then decreases it continuously to a minimum (Fig. 4). Similarly,
b-P/H-MoSe2 shows asymmetric behavior in band gap variation
with respect to the polarity of the applied external electric field
that results in direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. The change
in bandgap upon applying an external electric field is the result
of charge redistribution in the van der Waals gap as shown for
a-P/H-MoSe2 in Fig. 5. The asymmetric behavior of the bandgap
with an electric field in the case of semiconducting heterostruc-
tures can be attributed to the counterbalance of the external
electric field with the internal electric field arising due to the
diﬀerence in electronegativity and structural arrangements of
the atoms in the two layers of the heterostructure. The evolution
of bands as a function of applied electric field is given in Fig. 5
and Fig S4 of the ESI.†
In the case of metallic heterostructures, the tuning of the
Schottky barrier height (SBH) with an applied electric field can
be achieved. Particularly, upon applying a positive electric field
in a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2, the semiconductor–metal
contact remains ohmic but the Dirac cone moves energetically
below the valence band edge of a-P making the SHB negative
while for negative fields, the Dirac cone remains at the Fermi
level but the Schottky barrier changes from p-type to n-type
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S4 of the ESI†). In the case of b-P/T-MoSe2,
however, the positive field turns the barrier from n-type to
p-type as the valence band edge of b-P becomes closer to the
Fermi level while negative fields of around 1.0 V Å1 reduce
the barrier height to zero causing the given heterostructure to
possess ohmic contact. Obtaining zero or even very low SBH in
device contacts is one of the most crucial tasks for realizing
high-performance nano-material-based FETs.34,35
The change in the electronic structure with an applied field
can be quantified in terms of charge density diﬀerence profiles.

layer appears to be depleted of charge which clearly depicts
electron transfer from phosphorene to the MoSe2 layer.
Similarly, upon applying a negative field, electrons (holes)
tend to move from MoSe2 (phosphorene) to phosphorene
(MoSe2) (Fig. 5).

In the case of hexagonally symmetric systems, a and b are
equal in the harmonic range. Therefore, the in-plane stiﬀness
and Poisson’s ratio of H-MoSe2, T-MoSe2 and blue-P are the
same along the x and y directions. Also for the squared
symmetric SO-MoSe2, it is the same in both directions. On
the other hand, the anisotropy in ZT-MoSe2 and black-P struc-
tures along the x and y directions leads to diﬀerent in-plane
stiﬀness and Poisson’s ratio along the x and y directions
(Table 1). A strong bond (i.e., with smaller bond length) and
higher bond density leads to higher in-plane stiﬀness. But the
average bond lengths along the x and y directions in all the
considered MoSe2 phases are almost the same and also the Mo
atoms in all the structures are six fold coordinated. Hence
the diﬀerence in in-plane stiﬀness of these phases may be
attributed to the diﬀerent structural arrangements of Mo-Se
units in diﬀerent phases. SO-MoSe2 and b-P are found to be the
most and least flexible layers with the smallest (B46 N m1)
and highest (B277 N m1) values of in plane stiﬀness, respec-
tively. Also, the highest values of Poisson’s ratio for SO-MoSe2
(0.63) suggests its ease in expansion without breaking.
The in-plane stiﬀness and Poisson’s ratio of the considered
heterostructures are also depicted in Table 1. The in-plane stiﬀ-
ness values of the considered heterostructures follow the trend
b-P/H-MoSe2 4 b-P/T-MoSe2 4 a-P/ZT-MoSe2 4 a-P/H-MoSe2 4
a-P/SO-MoSe2. Hence, a-P/SO-MoSe2 with the lowest in-plane
stiﬀness and the highest Poisson’s ratio among all the hetero-
structures may find application in flexible van der Waals device
fabrication.
3.5
Simulated STM images
First principles calculations have been well known to simulate
the STM images by applying a small bias voltage Vbias between
the STM tip and the sample20,38–40 which yields a tunneling
current with density j(r) proportional to the local density of
states (LDOS) at the centre of the curvature of the tip at (r),
approximated by Tersoff and Hamann.41 The LDOS is inte-
grated from (EF–eV) to EF and the s-waves with constant density
of states describe the tip states. A positive (negative) bias
voltage indicates tunneling from the occupied states of the
sample to the tip (tip to unoccupied states of the sample).
The WSxM code42 has been employed here to obtain the STM
images derived from LDOS in constant current (CC) mode.
STM images of a-P containing heterostructures are simulated
at 0.5 V while for b-P based heterostructures images are
obtained at higher bias i.e. 1.5 V due to the higher energy
gap in the constituent monolayer of phosphorene, so as to get a
better understanding of the electronic states near the Fermi
level. Simulated STM images of the constituent monolayers are
clearly distinguishable due to the different atomic arrangement
in the given structures (Fig. 6). Bright colors in all the STM
images indicate the atoms nearest to the STM tip i.e., the top
most atoms. In the case of a-P, for forward bias, the electron
density is large over the P atoms while for reverse bias the
electron density is localized over the covalent bonds between
the pair of P atoms. This means that an antibonding character
is visible for positive bias while bonding character is visible for
negative bias. In the case of b-P, under forward as well as
reverse bias the contribution to electronic density is only from
upper P atoms (Fig. 6 and Fig. S5 of the ESI†). A similar
explanation is applicable for understanding the electronic
density distribution of other structures as well.
On comparing the STM images of the heterostructures with
that of the corresponding monolayers, we observe that in
addition to possessing the antibonding character of phosphorous
in a-P based heterostructures, the features of MoSe2 are clearly
depicted. Therefore, a-P can be potentially used as a capping layer
to diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent allotropes of MoSe2. On the
other hand, no diﬀerence in STM images was obtained for b-P
based heterostructures (Fig. 6 and Fig. S5 of the ESI†), hence b-P
cannot be used as a capping layer to diﬀerentiate between
diﬀerent MoSe2 allotropes.
3.6
Dielectric properties
Now we calculate the dielectric response of the given hetero-
structures and their constituent monolayers (Fig. 7 and Fig. S6
of the ESI†). The dielectric functions are found to be highly
anisotropic in the low energy range and become isotropic in the
high energy range. The structure peaks in the imaginary part of
the dielectric function (e2) are associated with the interband
transitions in the corresponding electronic structure. Note that
there are multiple interband transitions due to diﬀerent band
numbers and diﬀerent Brillouin zone directions that might
correspond to a particular structure peak in the imaginary part
of the dielectric function. For example, a-P and b-P possess two
prominent structure peaks, one at B4 eV corresponding to
lateral polarization and the other at B6 eV due to the vertical
polarization
which
corresponds
to
interband
transition
between the bands separated by B4 eV and B6 eV across the

Fermi level in the corresponding electronic structure which falls
in the ultraviolet region (3.2 eV to 12 eV). The energy of the
structure peaks remains nearly the same for the homobilayers as
well but the intensity increases (Fig. S6 of the ESI†). The higher
intensity in the case of homobilayers is attributed to the avail-
ability of an increased number of allowed bands for interband
transition. In the case of heterostructures also, the interband
transition is found to occur in the ultraviolet region and the
prominent feature is mainly due to phosphorene (Fig. 7).
The structure peaks in electron energy loss spectra (EELS)
depict the plasmonic excitations. Low energy plasmonic struc-
tures (p-plasmons) are related to the excitation of weak p-electrons
while high energy plasmonic features (p + s plasmons) are
associated with both weak p- and strong s-electrons.43 For
example, a-P exhibits two plasmonic features, one at lower energy
o8 eV and the other at energy 48 eV (Fig. 7). Note that five
valence electrons in a phosphorous atom gives rise to sp3 hybri-
dization, three of the electrons form covalent bonds with three

other atoms and the remaining two electrons occupy a lone pair.
Similarly, other monolayers considered in the study also exhibit
two types of plasmonic features. EELS of the homobilayer case
also exhibits two plasmonic peaks which get blue shifted with
respect to their monolayer counterparts (Fig. S6 of the ESI†).
In the case of heterostructures, the EELS of a-P/H-MoSe2,
a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2 depict high energy plasmonic
features corresponding to p- and s-electrons while the EELS of
b-P/H-MoSe2 and b-P/T-MoSe2 exhibit both high and low energy
plasmonic features (Fig. 7). The calculated values of static
dielectric constant (es) show the highly anisotropic response
of the given monolayers and heterostructures e.g. the value of es
for a-P is 3.7 and 2.2 for lateral and vertical polarization,
respectively, while these are 7.6 and 4.2 for a-P/H-MoSe2
heterostructures. The value of es in semiconducting monolayers
and heterostructures shows the inverse trend in comparison
with the corresponding band gap which can be attributed to the
two-band relationship es  1 þ

4. Summary
In summary, first principles calculations have been employed
to investigate various properties of phosphorene/MoSe2 hetero-
structures. The commensurate phosphorene based heterostruc-
tures are found to be semiconducting and metallic in nature.
a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2 are found to form ohmic con-
tacts whereas b-P/H-MoSe2 exhibits metallic features. An external

electric field induces semiconductor-to-metal transition in
a-P/H-MoSe2 while direct-to-indirect bandgap transition occurs
in b-P/H-MoSe2. In the case of a-P/ZT-MoSe2 and a-P/SO-MoSe2,
a positive field makes the Schottky barrier height negative while
a negative field changes the barrier from p-type to n-type. In
b-P/T-MoSe2, a positive field changes the barrier from n-type to
p-type while a negative field changes the contact to ohmic. The
mechanical response of the given heterostructures reveals that
a-P/SO-MoSe2 can be potentially used as a material for flexible
nanoelectronics. Simulated STM images of the given hetero-
structures depict that a-P can be used as a capping layer to
distinguish various allotropes of MoSe2. The dielectric response of
the considered heterostructures is found to be highly anisotropic.
Our results demonstrate that the considered structures have great
potential to be used as novel materials for nano-electronic device
applications based on van der Waals heterostructures.
