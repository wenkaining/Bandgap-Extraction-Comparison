The magnetic ground state of the antiferromagnet Kondo lattice compound Ce8Pd24Ga has been investigated
using neutron powder diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and zero-ﬁeld muon spin relaxation measure-
ments. The neutron diffraction analysis, below TN (3.660.2 K), reveals a commensurate type-C antiferromag-
netic structure with the ordered state magnetic moment of ;0.36mB /Ce-atom along the cubic ^111& directions.
The analysis of the inelastic neutron scattering data based on the crystal ﬁeld ~CF! model reveals a doublet
ground state with a ground state moment of 1.29mB /Ce-atom. The observed magnetic moment from neutron
diffraction, which is small compared to the expected value from CF analysis, is attributed to screening of the
local Ce moment by the Kondo effect. This is supported by the observed Kondo-type resistivity and a small
change in the entropy of Ce8Pd24Ga at TN . The zero-ﬁeld muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a sharp increase
below TN indicating ordering of Ce moments, in agreement with the neutron diffraction data. The present
studies reveal that the physical properties of Ce8Pd24Ga are governed by the on-site Kondo compensation, the
moment stabilizing intersite RKKY interaction and the crystal ﬁeld effect.

I. INTRODUCTION
Studies of Ce-based heavy fermion compounds are of fun-
damental importance for understanding their complex mag-
netic and transport properties. A number of recent discover-
ies have led to the resurgence of interest in the properties of
the binary compounds which crystallize in the well known
cubic Cu3Au-type structure.1–4 Among these, CeIn3 and
CePd3 exhibit interesting properties. CeIn3 shows antiferro-
magnetic ordering with TN510 K at ambient pressure, and
becomes superconducting with TC50.175 K at a pressure of
2.55 GPa.1 On the other hand CePd3 is a canonical interme-
diate valence compound which has been extensively investi-
gated using many experimental techniques.5–8 Despite of a
low carrier density, 0.3 electrons per formula unit, the low
temperature properties of CePd3 are consistent with a simple
Fermi-liquid ground state.9 The commonality between CeIn3
and CePd3 is the presence of a broad peak in the resistivity,
at 70 and 150 K, respectively, indicating the onset of a co-
herent Kondo lattice ground state.
In heavy fermion compounds the stability of the magnetic
ordered state depends on a delicate balance between the
long-range intermoment coupling driven by the Ruderman-
Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida ~RKKY! interaction and the on-site
Kondo hybridization between the 4f electrons and the con-
duction electrons.10,11 The strength of both the RKKY and
Kondo interactions depends on the coupling parameter ~rJ !,
TRKKY;(rJ )2 and TK;exp(21/urJ u), where J is the ex-
change parameter and r is the density of states of the con-
duction electrons at the Fermi level. In the strong coupling
limit, the so-called intermediate valence state as found in
CePd3 , the ground state is nonmagnetic. In this case both
charge and spin ﬂuctuations play an important role in the
physical properties of the materials. For the medium to weak
coupling limit, known as the heavy fermion regime, there
can be a variety of interesting ground states, including re-
duced moment modulated antiferromagnetism, a zero tem-
perature quantum critical point, unconventional supercon-
ductivity, and anomalous ferromagnetism. In this case the
physical properties are governed by the spin ﬂuctuations
only. The coupling strength is generally related to the num-
ber of holes in the s-p or d-like outer shells of a given ligand
and to its distance with respect to the Ce ions.12,13 By de-
creasing the number of these holes it is possible to dehybrid-
ize the 4f states leading to a dramatic change in the magnetic
and transport properties of the material. Such a dehybridiza-
tion effect in CePd3 has been observed when the compound
was alloyed with an appropriate ligand or by introduction of
small atoms such as B, Si or Ge at the interstitial site in the
Cu3Au unit cell.14–18 The interstitial impurities cause a dra-
matic cross-over from archetypal intermediate valence be-
havior in CePd3 to local moment character as seen through
resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and inelastic neutron scat-
tering studies.14–18
The crystal structure, magnetic and transport properties of
Ce8Pd24Ga have been investigated by various groups.3,19–22
This compound is closely related to CePd3 as the title com-
pound may also be written CePd3Ga0.125. Our recent high
resolution neutron powder diffraction study at 300 K on
Ce8Pd24Ga revealed that the crystal structure is composed of
distorted perovskite and Cu3Au subcells arranged with the
perovskite like units centered on the corners of the cube.21 In
the present work we have investigated the magnetic ground
state of Ce8Pd24Ga using neutron powder diffraction and
muon spin relaxation ~mSR! measurements below and above
TN . The results of our inelastic neutron scattering data21 are
discussed in the context of the studies presented here.

67 134419-1constituent elements with purity 99.9% on a water-cooled
copper hearth under high purity argon atmosphere. The ingot
was turned over and remelted several times to ensure homo-
geneity. The neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering
and muon measurements were carried out at the ISIS pulsed
neutron and muon source at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
UK. Temperature dependent lattice parameters were mea-
sured between 4 and 300 K using the high resolution neutron
powder diffractometer ~HRPD!. The magnetic structure was
investigated as low as 1.9 K using the medium resolution
neutron diffractometer ROTAX that views a cold methane
moderator making the instrument suitable for magnetic struc-
ture studies. For both the ROTAX and HRPD diffraction
experiments polycrystalline sample material was ﬁlled into a
cylindrical vanadium sample container of 11-mm diameter ~a
ﬂat plate type Al-sample holder was used for HRPD! and
mounted in a standard ‘‘orange-type’’ He cryostat. Both
HRPD and ROTAX are equipped with three detector banks,
each of which provides neutron diffraction data in a distinct
d spacing and resolution range. Inelastic neutron scattering
measurements were carried out using the time-of-ﬂight spec-
trometer HET using an incident neutron energy of 40 meV.
The Ce8Pd24Ga sample was cooled down to the lowest pos-
sible temperature of about 17 K in a closed-cycle refrigera-
tor. Zero ﬁeld m1SR measurements were carried on the
MuSR spectrometer between 1.5 and 6 K in a standard He-
cryostat. The sample was mounted on an Al-sample holder
with a silver mask. The neutron and mSR measurements
were performed on the same sample of Ce8Pd24Ga.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Neutron diffraction
The neutron powder diffraction studies show that down to
the lowest temperature of 1.9 K Ce8Pd24Ga crystallizes in the
cubic structure with space group Pm-3m ~no. 221!, in agree-
ment
with
our
previous
room
temperature
structural
analysis.21 It is to be noted that the unit-cell of Ce8Pd24Ga is
obtained by doubling the unit-cell of CePd3 in all three cubic
directions. The reﬁnement of the site occupancies shows that
the Ce and Pd sites are fully occupied, while the Ga site is
only 78~4!% occupied. A detailed description of the crystal
structure reﬁnement and the crystallographic parameters at
300 K was given earlier.21 Figure 1 shows the temperature
dependence of the cubic lattice parameter obtained from
Rietveld analysis. The lattice parameter decreases linearly
with temperature from 300 K and becomes nearly tempera-
ture independent at low temperatures ~below 15 K!, a typical
behavior expected for a system with thermally excited
phonons. The temperature dependence of the lattice param-
eter was analyzed using an Einstein expression of the form
a(T)5a01k/@exp(qE/T)21#, where a0 is the lattice param-
eter at 0 K, k is the Einstein constant, and qE is an effective
Einstein temperature. The solid line in Fig. 1 shows the re-
sultant ﬁt. The ﬁtted parameters are: a058.3669(1) Å, k
50.0170(2) Å, and qE5157(5) K. The Einstein model
yields a reasonable ﬁt to the data over the entire temperature
range suggesting that the electronic contribution to the tem-
perature dependence of the lattice parameter is small. We
have
estimated
the
Gru¨neisen
parameter

for
Ce8Pd24Ga, using the above values of k and qE , and taking
a typical value of the bulk modulus ;1 Mbar.
Figure 2 shows the ROTAX forward scattering neutron
powder diffraction pattern of Ce8Pd24Ga collected at 1.9 K.
At this temperature extra pure magnetic reﬂections with
small intensities, such as ~110! at a d spacing of 5.95 Å, are
observed in addition to the nuclear reﬂections. There are also
additional small magnetic intensities observed on top of
nuclear peaks, such as ~211! ~see the inset of Fig. 2!. These
additional magnetic Bragg intensities are assumed to arise
from the antiferromagnetic ordering of Ce31 moments at 1.9
K, in agreement with the heat capacity and resistivity
measurements.20,21 The observed magnetic reﬂections can be
indexed on the basis of the crystallographic unit cell of
Ce8Pd24Ga, i.e., with the wave vector q5(0,0,0). It is im-
portant to note that the same magnetic peaks can be indexed
with respect to a smaller cubic CePd3-type unit cell with a
propagation vector @ 1

134419-2type-C antiferromagnetic structure of a primitive cubic lat-
tice earlier.23 In the Ce8Pd24Ga setting the Ce atoms occupy
site 8g, site symmetry 3m, that leads to the admissible mag-
netic site symmetry 3m8 restricting the Ce moments to di-
rections along the threefold axis along ^111&.24 The corre-
sponding magnetic space group is Pm3m8,25 corresponding
to a triple-q structure model in terms of the @ 1
2, 1
2, 0# propa-
gation vector, thus preserving the cubic symmetry. This non-
collinear model, which has magnetic moments oriented
along symmetry-equivalent ^111& directions, represents the
highest possible symmetry for the magnetic structure for ﬁt-
ting the magnetic intensities with one structure parameter
only, i.e., the magnetic moment magnitude of the Ce31 ions.
This magnetic structure cannot be discriminated by the dif-
fraction experiments from other models of lower symmetry,
e.g., a single-q structure. The restriction of the number of
variable parameters was a main consideration for the model
setup in view of the very weak observed magnetic powder
diffraction intensities. The proposed structure takes into ac-
count the averaging of magnetic intensities over magnetic
domains. The magnetic moment reﬁnement of Ce8Pd24Ga
was performed with the program GSAS,26 using diffraction
patterns from the three banks in a Rietveld reﬁnement. The
magnetic form factor of Ce31 was calculated in dipole ap-
proximation using analytical approximations as tabulated in
the Ref. 27. The resultant Rietveld ﬁt of the forward scatter-
ing bank data is shown in Fig. 2. The reﬁned moment value
is 0.36(2)mB /Ce-atom. A schematic representation of the
magnetic structure of Ce8Pd24Ga is displayed in Fig. 3. The
magnetic moment magnitude as a function of temperature is
plotted in Fig. 4. The magnetic moment of the Ce ion is
saturated at low temperatures and almost constant at about
0.36mB /Ce-atom between 1.9 and 3 K, rapidly dropping off
to zero as the transition temperature is approached. Moment
values of 0.2mB , corresponding to moment components of
0.1mB along the cubic axes, are close to the detection limit of
the powder diffraction experiment. Figure 4 also compares
the temperature variation of the magnetic moment with a
phenomenological power-law behavior28 m(T);(12td)b,
where t5T/TN with TN53.6 K, where b50.43 is taken

and where a value of d510 ensures saturation of the mag-
netic moment curve below 3 K. The slightly higher value of
TN53.6 K obtained for the neutron diffraction sample of
Ce8Pd24Ga ~mass '20 g!, compared to TN53.1 K reported
through the heat capacity and resistivity measurements ~mass
'5 g!,20,21 may be due to different Ga site occupancies in the
different samples.
B. Inelastic neutron scattering
Figure 5~a! shows the magnetic inelastic response from
Ce8Pd24Ga measured on HET at 17 K. The phonon scattering
has been subtracted using a standard scaling method.21,29 We
observed two well-deﬁned crystal ﬁeld ~CF! excitations at
energies of 3.2 and 12.8 meV, corresponding to transitions
from the ground state doublet to the two excited CF doublets.
It is noteworthy that the inelastic response of CePd3 does not
show any sign of CF excitations, instead it exhibits a gap
type response below 20 meV ~i.e., no magnetic scattering!
and a broad q-independent peak centered at 65 meV with a
linewidth of 68 meV.29,30 This is a typical response observed
in valence-ﬂuctuating systems, in which the strong hybrid-
ization between localized 4f electrons and conduction elec-
trons is present.31 The presence of well deﬁned CF excita-
tions
in
Ce8Pd24Ga
indicates
that
the
strength
of
hybridization has reduced considerably. This is further sup-
ported by the dramatic reduction in Kondo temperature from
150 K for CePd3 to 5.8 K for Ce8Pd24Ga. The point symme-
try of the Ce site in Ce8Pd24Ga is trigonal, 3m. This gives
two additional terms in the cubic CF Hamiltonian of the

direction in Ce8Pd24Ga, which is in agreement with the neu-
tron diffraction analysis.
C. Zero ﬁeld muon spin relaxation
The zero ﬁeld muon spin relaxation is a unique technique
and has played an important role to investigate dynamical
ﬂuctuations and static inhomogeneities in reduced moment
heavy fermion systems.33 In order to shed more light on the
nature of the magnetic ground state in Ce8Pd24Ga, zero ﬁeld
mSR measurements have been carried out on a polycrystal-
line sample below and above TN . Figure 6 shows zero ﬁeld
mSR spectra from Ce8Pd24Ga measured at various tempera-
tures. The zero ﬁeld mSR spectra show a very small depolar-
ization rate in the paramagnetic state, while below 3.8 K an
onset of strong muon depolarization is observed, which is in
agreement with the antiferromagnetic ordering observed by
neutron diffraction. Surprisingly, even well below the mag-
netic ordering temperature there is no clear sign of a coherent
oscillation in the zero ﬁeld mSR spectra that would give
evidence of a muon spin precession around a static internal
magnetic ﬁeld. A very similar situation has been observed for
the antiferromagnet YbCu3Al2 (TN52 K) and ferromagnetic
CePdSb (TC517.5 K).34,35 This might suggest that the aver-
age dipolar ﬁeld, experienced by the muon spins at the muon
stopping site, is equal to zero in Ce8Pd24Ga. In this scenario
the sharp increase of the muon depolarization rate observed
below TN in Ce8Pd24Ga could be understood as a result of
the distribution of internal ﬁelds with zero mean at the muon
site.
In the paramagnetic state the zero ﬁeld mSR spectra are
well described using a product of a temperature-independent
Kubo-Toyabe ~KT! function, arising from the Ga and Pd
nuclear moments, and an exponential relaxing function
~ERF!, exp(2l1t), representing the additional muon depolar-
ization due to ﬂuctuating electronic 4f-magnetic moments.
The dynamic relaxation rate l1 is related to the interaction
amplitude and to the rate of the spin ﬂuctuations. In our
analysis, we have also added a small time and temperature
independent background contribution (abg50.026, estimated
from the spectra at 1.6 K! arising from muon stopping in the
silver mask. Fits to data collected at temperatures above TN
yield good agreement between observed and calculated spec-

sKT50.0306 ms21. The comparison of this value for sKT
with the calculated value from the second moment of the
internal nuclear dipole ﬁeld distribution across the unit cell
of Ce8Pd24Ga indicates that the muons are localized at the ~0,

does not ﬁt the data collected below TN . Data modeling with
various forms of alternative, single component muon spin
relaxation functions did not result in satisfactory ﬁts of the
data below TN . The spectra could be best ﬁtted over the
entire temperature range by adding a second component to
the product of KT and ERF for the temperature regime below

additonal second term. The ﬁrst and third terms are also used
for ﬁtting above TN whereas the second term contributes
below TN only. The functional form of the second term has
been suggested for a muon stopping site of high symmetry in
an antiferromagnetic matrix.36 At such a site the mean ﬁeld is
zero. From the neutron powder diffraction experiments it fol-
lows that 22~4!% of the Ga site is vacant in Ce8Pd24Ga;
hence one expect a different value of moment for the Ce
atoms around this vacant site, which justiﬁes to use the sec-
ond term and, hence, the two components model in our
analysis. In the analysis, the values of total asymmetry, a
5a11a2, abg and sKT were kept ﬁxed. The temperature
dependent relaxation rates l1 and l2 and asymmetries, a1
and a2 , obtained from the ﬁts are displayed in Figs. 7~a! and
7~b!. Below TN l2 increases sharply on cooling, while l1
shows a very weak temperature dependence @Fig. 7~a!#. On
the other hand, the asymmetry a2 decreases sharply when the
temperature is raised towards TN , accompanied by a com-
pensation rise of a1 @Fig. 7~b!#. These two types of compo-
nents in the muon depolarization rate have been also ob-
served in antiferromagnetic CeAl2 and the heavy fermion
YbBiPt.33 The presence of two components has been attrib-
uted to two types of domains in these materials. In
Ce8Pd24Ga the fast depolarization rate (l2) is associated
with the magnetic ordered domain, while the slow depolar-
ization rate (l1) is associated with the paramagnetic domain.
The asymmetry ~or amplitudes! of the fast component (a2)
represents the magnetic volume fraction, and the asymmetry
of the slowly damped component (a1) reﬂects the paramag-
netic volume fraction. The volume fractions of magnetic and
paramagnetic domains at 3.1 K ~1.6 K! are 77% ~88%! and
23% ~12%!, respectively. These values agree with the frac-
tional occupancy of the Ga site ~78%! obtained from the high
resolution neutron powder diffraction measurements. This in-
dicates that the Ce ions adjacent to Ga vacancies remain
paramagnetic below TN .
The temperature dependence of l2 has been modeled us-
ing the same functional power-law term that was plotted with
the ordered magnetic moment in Fig. 4, namely, l2(T);(1
2td)b @Fig. 7~a!#, yielding TN53.51(1) K, b50.429(1),
and d52.05(2). The value of TN obtained from the muon
data is in agreement with that obtained from the neutron
diffraction study. The phenomenological parameter of d
52.05, reﬂecting spin-wave excitations,28 is very close to 2
predicted for a cubic antiferromagnetic system.37 We do not
clearly understand at present the disagreement with the much
higher value of d510 employed to obtain a saturated or-
dered magnetic moment below 3 K ~Fig. 4!. One of the rea-
sons could be a few data points with a large errors near TN in
the diffraction data.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, we have investigated the antiferro-
magnetic Kondo lattice compound Ce8Pd24Ga using neutron
diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and zero-ﬁeld muon
spin relaxation measurements. The chemical formula of the
title compound can also be written as CePd3Ga0.125 in order
to make a direct comparison with CePd3 . The present study
reveals that the physical properties of CePd3 change strongly
with the incorporation of the Ga atom into the cubic cell. The
change of the physical properties could be attributed to the
dehybridization of Ce-4f and Pd-4d electrons as a result of
the shorter bond length ~2.453 Å! between Pd-Ga atoms, that
produces a strong overlap between the p-electrons of the Ga
and d electrons of the Pd, and hence the strong dehybridiza-
tion in Ce8Pd24Ga. The effect of dehybridization is clearly
seen through the drastic change in the Kondo temperature
(TK), 150 K for CePd3 and 5.8 K for Ce8Pd24Ga.21 The

134419-5observation of the magnetic ordering in Ce8Pd24Ga is con-
sistent with the prediction by Doniach’s phase diagram,
which reveals that with reducing the hybridization ~or the
coupling constant, rI!, the Kondo temperature decreases and
the magnetic ordering temperature increases. Furthermore,
the observation of well deﬁned crystal ﬁeld excitations in
Ce8Pd24Ga indicates that the Ce ions are in the localized
state.
The neutron diffraction study of Ce8Pd24Ga shows that
the
Ce
magnetic
moment
in
the
order
state
is
;0.36mB /Ce-atom, compared with the predicted CF ground
state moment 1.29mB /Ce-atom from the crystal ﬁeld eigen-
state, which clearly indicates the reduced moment magnetic
ordering. The study of reduced moment magnetic ordering in
Ce-, Yb-, and U-based heavy fermion compounds is an ac-
tive area of research in the ﬁeld of heavy fermion systems.
This type of reduced moment antiferromagnetic ordering has
been observed in Ce(Ni0.65Pd0.25)2Ge2 , with an estimated
ordered state moment of 0.55mB /Ce-atom, and in the heavy
fermion antiferromagnetic superconductor UPt3 (Tc50.5 K
and TN55 K), with an estimated ordered state moment of
0.02mB /U-atom.38,39 The presence of the Kondo effect in
Ce8Pd24Ga has been conﬁrmed through the temperature
dependence resistivity, the scaling behavior of the magne-
toresistance, and the observed small entropy change, 16.4
J mole21 K21
compared
with
the
8RLn(2)
546.1 J mole21 K21 expected from a doublet CF ground
state.20,21 Therefore, the origin of the reduced moment order-
ing in Ce8Pd24Ga is attributed to the screening of the local
4f-moment by the conduction electrons by forming a Kondo
singlet state. The energy gain due to the singlet formation is
KBTK . It should be noted that below 8 K Ce8Pd24Ga shows
an onset of the coherence in the resistivity, i.e., Kondo lattice
behavior, implying the importance of interactions between
the magnetic ions of the lattice. In this scenario, while gain-
ing the energy through the singlet formation, the system is
also losing the magnetic interaction energy between the sites.
This implies that the singlet formation should not be fully
complete when the intersite interaction is sufﬁciently strong,
and hence the system orders magnetically with a reduced
magnetic moment. This is because the fully Kondo compen-
sation of the 4f-moments would lead to an overall loss of
energy instead of an energy gain. Thus, the Kondo compen-
sation model explains the reduced moment magnetic order-
ing in Ce8Pd24Ga.
