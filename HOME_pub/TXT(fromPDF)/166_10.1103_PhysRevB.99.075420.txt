Crossing from the repulsive to the attractive Casimir force is analyzed for two Au and two Si half spaces
with boundary Chern-Simons layers. Boundary quantum Hall layers in external magnetic ﬁeld lead to Casimir
repulsion at nanoscales. We discuss features that make systems with boundary quantum Hall layers unique for
precise force measurements.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Casimir effect [1] is a quantum interaction effect
between macroscopic objects [2–14]. Chern-Simons terms
[15] were intensively studied in quantum ﬁeld theory [16–19];
Chern-Simons action violates P and T discrete symmetries.
Various aspects of the Casimir interaction due to the pres-
ence of Chern-Simons terms were studied in literature. The
Casimir force between parallel lines with Dirichlet boundary
conditions was calculated within 2+1 Abelian electrodynam-
ics with the Chern-Simons term in [20]. In 2+1 dimensions
the constant of the Chern-Simons term has a dimension of
mass, and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics pos-
sesses a massive spin-1 excitation. In the 3+1 dimensions
case considered in this paper the Chern-Simons term constant
a is dimensionless. In [21,22] rigid nonpenetrable boundary
conditions modiﬁed by the Chern-Simons term were intro-
duced. The boundary conditions in [21,22] do not describe
Hall conductivity at the boundary; however, they may lead to
the Casimir repulsion [22].
The Casimir interaction of two ﬂat Chern-Simons layers
in vacuum was considered in [23,24]. The Casimir-Polder
potential of a neutral anisotropic atom in the presence of
a ﬂat Chern-Simons layer was found in [25]. Charge-parity
violating effects due to a Chern-Simons layer interacting
with an atom were considered in [26]; novel possibilities for
electron electric dipole moment search in the presence of a
Chern-Simons layer were proposed.
In topological insulators the standard electromagnetic en-
ergy density of a Lagrangian is supplemented by a term
proportional to θ⃗E ⃗H in a low-energy effective ﬁeld theory ap-
proach; the parameter θ is the topological magnetoelectric po-
larizability. The action term with θ⃗E ⃗H can be integrated over
a volume of the topological insulator into a Chern-Simons
term at the boundary. A consistent description of the bulk
and the boundary of the topological insulator is possible only
when there is a time-reversal breaking perturbation at the
boundary to gap surface states; a magnetic layer coating of the
boundary of small thickness l ≪1 μm should be used to gap
surface states. The parameter a of the Chern-Simons action
*maraval@mail.ru; v.marachevsky@spbu.ru
is quantized in this case as a = αθ/(2π), θ = (2m + 1)π,
α is the QED ﬁne-structure constant, and m is an integer
number [27]. Casimir interaction of two topological insulators
modeled by a dielectric function in the bulk was studied
in [28,29]. A Green’s function approach was used in [30]
to study interaction of the topological insulator boundary in
vacuum with two perfectly conducting planes. According to
[31] the Casimir force between topological insulators may
drastically differ from results [32,33] so that no Casimir
repulsion is present if one includes the parity anomaly term in
the conductivity. Topological magnetoelectric effect has not
yet been observed in experiments.
There exists a different possibility: it is natural to perform
Casimir force measurements with standard quantum Hall
layers as Chern-Simons boundary layers. Suppose one puts
the system in a constant external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to the layers. The constant a of the Chern-Simons action is
uniquely deﬁned by the plateau of the quantum Hall effect
in terms of QED ﬁne-structure constant α ≃1/137 and an
integer or a fractional number n characterizing this plateau
as a = αn [34]. The plateau is deﬁned by a given number n
depending on the magnitude of the external magnetic ﬁeld
speciﬁc for concrete material of the layer. Without an external
electric ﬁeld parallel to the quantum Hall layer there are no
spatial components of the Hall current in the boundary layer,
so it is reasonable to perform Casimir force measurements in
this regime.
The total force in the Casimir experiments typically con-
sists of two parts: the Casimir and the electrostatic contribu-
tions [35,36]. The difference in the theoretical and experimen-
tal determination of the force may be a signal of long-range
forces beyond electromagnetism measured in experiment.
Long-range interactions beyond electromagnetism arise due
to the exchange of light scalar particles predicted in many
extensions of the standard model leading to Yukawa-type po-
tentials [37], Yukawa-type potentials in the extra-dimensional
theories with a low-energy compactiﬁcation scale [38,39],
power-type potentials [40,41], and axion exchange potential
[42]. In the interaction range above a few micrometers the
strongest constraints on potentials of long-range interactions
follow from Cavendish-type experiments [43–46]; at shorter
separations the strongest constraints on Yukawa-type poten-
tials and axion-to-nucleon coupling constants were obtained

from various Casimir effect experiments [12,35,47–49]. An
increase of precision in experimental determination of the
Casimir forces should allow detection of long-range interac-
tions beyond the standard model or at least improvement of
constraints on potentials of long-range interactions. Quantum
Hall boundary layers offer a novel possibility to perform
measurements at different values of the parameter n so that
the Casimir force can be changed without modifying the bulk
material. The possibility to perform force measurements at a
given separation with a variable parameter of the system is a
natural way to increase the precision of force determination.
We proceed as follows. In Sec. II we start from the Casimir
energy of two dielectric half spaces with Chern-Simons layers
at plane-parallel boundaries separated by a vacuum slit L.
The Casimir energy is derived in a scattering formalism
[11,50–56]. We study Casimir forces for Au and Si half
spaces with Chern-Simons boundary layers, crossing from the
repulsive to the attractive Casimir force is analyzed, and ratios
to Lifshitz force [3] are evaluated. We study Au and Si because
these materials are frequently used in the Casimir effect exper-
iments. The results of the paper are directly applicable to two
dielectric half spaces with quantum Hall boundary layers in a
constant external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the layers.
In the Appendix a diffraction problem for a Chern-Simons
layer at the boundary of dielectric half space characterized by
a permittivity ε(ω) is solved, and reﬂection and transmission
coefﬁcients for diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave
are derived. We use units ¯h = c = 1.

Consider two Au half spaces separated by a vacuum slit
with Chern-Simons boundary layers satisfying the condition
a ≡a1 = a2. At large separations the Casimir force is attrac-
tive. At short separations there exists a range of parameters a
and distances with a repulsive Casimir force. It is instructive
to plot the position of the energy minimum separating regions

interaction between two dielectric/metal half spaces separated
by a vacuum slit. To evaluate the Casimir force in the non-
retarded limit one should use optical data for frequency dis-
persion of the dielectric permittivity on the whole frequency
axis. This is the reason why the simple Drude model of Au and
even the six-oscillator model of Au cannot be used for precise
calculations of the Casimir forces at these separations. The
energy plot with Chern-Simons parameters a1 = a2 = 0.565
(corresponding to a maximum value L0 = 3.65 nm in Fig. 1)
is shown in Fig. 2. The change of the force from repulsive to
attractive behavior takes place at the distance L0 = 3.65 nm in
this case.
For dielectric permittivity of intrinsic Si we used the model

It is also instructive to plot the ratio of the Casimir force
with Chern-Simons layers at the boundaries of two half spaces
F to the Lifshitz force Fs [3] (the force between two dielectric
half spaces separated by a distance L). These ratios for Au
and Si are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively; the transition
between repulsive and attractive regimes of the Casimir force
due to Chern-Simons boundary layers is clearly seen. Note
that the ratio of the forces quickly decreases at L0 < L ≲
20 nm for Au and L0 < L ≲30 nm for Si systems.

attractive retarded L−4 to attractive nonretarded L−3 behavior
for dielectrics (metals) at distances of the order L ∼10 nm.
On the other hand, the force between two Chern-Simons
layers in vacuum has L−4 behavior at all separations and
thus dominates the total force at separations of the order L ≲
10 nm. For an interval a ∈[0, a0], where a0 ≈1.032 502, and
the condition a ≡a1 = a2, the Casimir force between two
Chern-Simons layers in vacuum is always repulsive [23,24].
As a result, the sum of the Lifshitz force and the force
between two Chern-Simons layers in vacuum effectively leads
to Casimir repulsion at short separations.
For a1 = −a2 the force is always attractive; the ratios of the
Casimir force with Chern-Simons layers at the boundaries of
two half spaces F to the Lifshitz force Fs are plotted in Figs. 7
and 8 for Au and Si, respectively. The attractive Casimir force
in this case is due to a theorem that opposites obtained by
mirror images of each other attract when they are separated
by a vacuum slit [60].
Chern-Simons constants of the layers at z = 0 and z = L
will be equal (a ≡a1 = a2) in a constant external magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the layers if one uses quantum Hall
layers at the boundaries of dielectric half spaces. Quantum
Hall layers are effectively described by Chern-Simons terms
at plateaus of the quantum Hall effect with Chern-Simons
constants a = αn, where α is a QED ﬁne-structure constant,
and n is an integer or a fractional number corresponding to an
integer or fractional quantum Hall effect. It is reasonable to
put an external electric ﬁeld parallel to the layers equal to zero
to avoid spatial components of Hall currents in the boundary
layers. Quantum Hall layers will lead to Casimir repulsion at
nanoscales for a ≲1 for Au and Si. An essential decrease of
the Casimir force due to the presence of boundary quantum
Hall layers in comparison with Lifshitz force should be seen
at separations L ≲20 nm for Au and L ≲30 nm for Si half
spaces.

As follows from Fig. 1 for Au bulk and Fig. 3 for Si bulk,
for n ⩽78 one has to increase n to obtain the Casimir energy
minimum at larger L0. Integer quantum Hall effect yields a
plateau with n = 10 with zero longitudinal conductivity in
most quantum Hall effect measurements, a ≃0.073 in this
case, which corresponds to energy minimum at separation
L0 ≃0.5 nm for Si bulk as follows from Fig. 3. To obtain
higher values of L0 there exist three options. The ﬁrst one
is to obtain Hall plateaus with zero longitudinal conductivity
at higher values of n. The maximum value L0 = 6.39 nm
for Si bulk in Fig. 3 corresponds to a = 0.567 and n = 78.
Another possibility is to change the dielectric permittivity of
bulk materials so that L0 increases for a given a. The third

option is to change the bulk geometry and have less material
in the bulk, which will move L0 to higher values for a given
a. A combination of these three options should ﬁnally lead to
the Casimir repulsion in the laboratory. The second and third
options require further theoretical analysis of available bulk
materials and geometries to understand an effective way to
increase L0 at a given Hall conductivity.
The Casimir force between two half spaces with quan-
tum Hall boundary layers can be evaluated with high pre-
cision: Hall conductivities are deﬁned by plateaus of the
quantum Hall effect, and frequency-dependent dielectric per-
mittivities of bulk half spaces can be extracted from the
tabulated optical data [58]. The availability of the additional
parameter n in the result for the Casimir force enables a
comparison of the theory and experiments at different plateaus
of the quantum Hall effect with the same bulk material at a
given separation; due to this feature it is natural to expect an
increase of precision in the determination of the Casimir force.
III. CONCLUSIONS
Casimir forces for two dielectric half spaces with Chern-
Simons boundary layers separated by a vacuum slit L have
remarkable properties. For equal Chern-Simons terms the
Casimir energy has a minimum at L = L0 for an interval of
constants a of Chern-Simons terms; the Casimir force for
such systems is repulsive at short separations and attractive at
large separations. We have shown that for Au half spaces with
Chern-Simons boundary layers the minimum of the Casimir
energy can be achieved at separation L0 = 3.65 nm, and for
Si half spaces with Chern-Simons boundary layers at L0 =
6.39 nm.
It is natural to consider experimental implementation of
Chern-Simons layers as quantum Hall layers in the presence
of a constant external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the
layers and a zero external electric ﬁeld parallel to the layers.
Knowledge of the Chern-Simons constant a = αn at each
plateau of the quantum Hall effect (characterized by an integer
or a fractional number n) enables a precise evaluation of the
Casimir force at plateaus of quantum Hall effect.
There are several features that make systems with Chern-
Simons boundary layers unique for force measurements: de-
crease of the Casimir force in comparison to the Lifshitz force
for two dielectric half spaces [3] at separations approaching
the minimum of the Casimir energy, precise evaluation of
the Casimir force from ﬁrst principles, and the possibility
of changing plateaus in the quantum Hall effect regime by
external magnetic ﬁeld resulting in a change of the force at a
given separation.
The geometry of two half spaces with plane-parallel
boundaries separated by a vacuum slit L is the simplest ge-
ometry where novel features due to Chern-Simons boundary
layers occur. By changing the geometry of the system and bulk
materials one can increase separations at which the Casimir
energy minimum occurs.
