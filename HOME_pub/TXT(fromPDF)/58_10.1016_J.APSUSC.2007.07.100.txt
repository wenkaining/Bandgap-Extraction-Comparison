Abstract
We have studied Pb thin ﬁlms as a function of the thickness up to 60 monolayers (MLs) using ab initio ﬁrst principles and model calculations.
Magic heights corresponding to a modulated oscillatory pattern of the energy of Pb(1 1 1) ﬁlms have been measured up to about 30 MLs. We
demonstrate that this behaviour continues even for higher thickness due to an extra second modulation pattern in the energetics of the metal ﬁlm as
a function of the number of atomic layers. The origin of this second modulation is the nesting of two close values of the Fermi wavelength in the
(1 1 1) direction.

1. Introduction
Quantum size effects (QSEs) are a key issue to understand
the physical properties of nanostructures. They show up in the
stability of clusters or nanowires, which is favored for some
values of their radius, so-called ‘‘magic’’ [1,2]. This behaviour
has been shown to affect also the growth of islands or thin ﬁlms
over surfaces. In particular, these effects are very strong for
Pb(1 1 1) ﬁlms, which can form wide ﬂat ﬁlms of preferred
thickness. Monitoring the growth of Pb nanoislands over
Cu(1 1 1) [3] or Si(1 1 1) [4] with different experimental
techniques (such as He atom scattering (HAS) [5], scanning
tunnelling microscopy (STM) [3], photoemission and surface
X-ray diffraction) has revealed the preference of Pb for bilayer
growth [6].
The origin of the ‘‘magic’’ height selection is easy to
understand qualitatively with a simple picture of electrons
conﬁned in a potential well [7]: valence electrons ﬁll
paraboloidal subbands and, as the thickness of the slab is
increased new quantum well states are occupied, producing
oscillations in the energy and related physical properties with
periodicity lF=2 (lF is the Fermi wavelength of electrons in Pb).
When the interlayer spacing (d) of Pb in the (1 1 1) direction is
considered, the approximate relation d  3lF=4 gives rise to a
beat pattern superimposed to the oscillations [8,6] with an even–
odd change in the magic number of atomic layers at the beats.
The energy minima can be related to the magic or more stable
thicknesses measured in the experiments. A quantitative
description of the measured magic sizes, on the other hand,
requires more sophisticated models. In some studies the support
has been included to provide an accurate description of the
experiments [8–10]. There are several theoretical works devoted
to the study of QSEs in thin ﬁlms within the density functional
theory (DFT). In this paper, we explore larger sizes (up to
60 MLs) of Pb thin ﬁlms than considered in the literature by
usingabinitio calculations, which include the atomic structureof
Pb ﬁlms. We ﬁnd a second extra modulation of the oscillations in
the energetics of the thin ﬁlms and explore the origin of this new
modulation and its effect on the stability at higher coverages than
measured up to now.
2. Ab initio ﬁrst principles calculations
We have analized the stability of free-standing Pb(1 1 1)
ﬁlms as a function of the number of monolayers (N), up to
N ¼ 60 ML, taking into account the atomic structure. As the
stability is given by the energy of the slabs, we have calculated
ﬁrst the total energy as a function of N. In this study, we are not

doi:10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.07.100interested in the quantitative agreement with the experiments,
but on the amplitude and the general trend of the oscillations for
thicker ﬁlms than studied up to now (N > 30). Previous jellium
calculations [8] studied the effect of the support, but in that
approach only one value of the Fermi wavevector is involved,
i.e., a spherical Fermi surface is assumed. The support can
introduce a shift of these oscillations but this is not the topic of
our work. The key of ab initio calculations is that they provide a
more realistic description of the Fermi surface.
Our calculations have been performed with the VASP code
[11] by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[12] for the exchange-correlation potential and the projector
augmented-wave method (PAW) [13]. Convergence of the
energies
versus
plane-wave
cutoff
(237 eV),
k-mesh
(22  22), and vacuum (10 ML) have been chosen to get
high accuracy. These values are in agreement with ref. [14].
Previous ab initio calculations for a small number of layers
included the lattice relaxation [15], but we have considered
bulk distances between atoms. This relaxation would affect
only the position of the ﬁrst beat, and it is not so important for
the present study.
To analyze the stability we have calculated the second
derivative of the energy versus the number of monolayers. The
results are shown in Fig. 1 with continuous line. Notice the
minus sign, so that the minima correspond to stable ﬁlms, as in
previous jellium calculations. With the aim of comparing with
the 1=D2 damping of the oscillations reported by jellium
calculations [16], we have multiplied the second derivative of
the energy times the square of the slab thickness. First of all we
observe modulated oscillations, like ‘‘packets’’, with a period
of about 8 ML. Between these ‘‘packets’’ there are beats with
an even–odd slip in the magic thickness. This trend is similar to
the jellium results reported in the literature. For N < 10 ML
there are slight differences, the ﬁrst beat is moved upwards. The
interface properties with the substrate and the relaxation effects
also can affect at these coverages, but we are not interested in
that region [8,9]. For larger coverages we observe a stronger
damping in the ab initio result than the inverse square law
observed for jellium. In addition, the distance between beats
changes. This is more evident for N > 30 ML, and around 40
ML the period decreases to about 6.4 ML.
3. Comparison with analytical models
Jellium model calculations assume one value of the Fermi
wavelength, close to 7.5 a0 for Pb(1 1 1). Within that model,
the energy oscillations times the square effective thickness
(Deff) of the ﬁlm can be ﬁtted to a simple sinusoidal expression
which reproduces the beat pattern:
soscD2
eff ¼ sin ½2kFðdN þ d0Þ
(1)
where d0 is a surface shift that accounts for the charge spill-out
at the surfaces, d the interlayer spacing, and N is the number of
layers.
Our ab initio results could not be ﬁtted with expression (1),
i.e., using one value of kF in the whole thickness range, but we
succeeded to ﬁt nicely the ab initio values with a superposition
of two sinusoidal expressions for two very close values of kF.
We tried the following analytical description of Fig. 1:
A1sin ½2kF1ðdN þ d0Þ þ A1sin ½2kF2ðdN þ d0Þ
(2)
where kF1 and kF2 are two close Fermi wavevectors in the
(1 1 1) direction and A1 and A2 are their corresponding weights.
The ﬁt to such expression using lF1 ¼ 7:47a0, lF1 ¼ 7:54a0,
A1 ¼ 0:72 and A2 ¼ 1:28 is really good. The result is an extra
modulation over the ﬁrst modulation, which gives the ‘‘pack-
ets’’ and ﬁrst beats described by one value of kF. This second
modulation produces an extra second quantum beat, respon-
sible for the stability at coverages over 30 MLs. The values of
kF used for the ﬁtting to the analytical expression (2) are very
close to the values reported in the literature. The second Fermi
wavelength arises because the section of the Fermi surface for
Pb is not circular but has a butterﬂy shape [3,17], as shown in
the inset of Fig. 2. In a different context, the deviation of the
Fermi surface from the spherical shape has been found to affect
the magnetic interlayer coupling in multilayers, being impor-
tant for distances as long as 100 MLs [18].
The values of the nesting wavelengths underlying the
oscillations obtained with ab initio calculations are extracted
from their Fourier transform, plotted in Fig. 2 with continuous
line. In the same plot we show the peaks corresponding to the
analytical expressions that assume one (dotted line) and two
(dashed line) Fermi wavevectors given by Eqs. (1) and (2),
respectively. We notice that both beat frequencies for the
analytical model of Eq. (2) have merged into a broad peak in the
ab initio calculations. In part, this is due to the actual window of
layer sizes.
In the inset of Fig. 2, the behaviour of the oscillations with
one kF (circular section of Fermi surface) is shown as compared
to the two kF nesting behaviour, corresponding to the butterﬂy
like section of the Fermi surface. The one kF case produces a
modulated oscillating structure, but the two kF plot gives a more
rich pattern with a second modulation. In that sketch, two kF

30values with the same weight have been considered, so that the
second quantum beat is clearly distinguished, and it is not
accompanied by a slip from even to odd at that beat. This sketch
explains already the origin and the trend of the ab initio results
displayed in Fig. 1, but is not exactly the same, due to the
different weights of the wavevectors.
4. Conclusions
We have shown that there are new features (a second
modulation structure) in the quantum oscillations of Pb thin
ﬁlms at high coverages (N > 30 ML), about the borderline of
the thickness explored by experiments up to now. We have
obtained a good description of the energy oscillations obtained
with ab initio calculations (N < 60 ML) using sinusoidal
expressions with two similar nesting Fermi wavelengths. The
agreement is not good in the whole thickness range studied
when only one value of the Fermi wavelength is considered.
The second modulation of the energy oscillations would
account for the magic stability of thin ﬁlms at high coverages.
Anyway, more experiments would be helpful at higher
coverages (N > 30 ML) in order to check this effect.
