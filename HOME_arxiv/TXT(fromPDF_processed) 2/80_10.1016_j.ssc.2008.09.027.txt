Singh Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831-6114 (Dated: October 30, 2018) We report ﬁrst principles calculations of the phonon dispersions of PbTe both for its observed structure and under compression.
At the experimental lattice parameter we ﬁnd a near instability of the optic branch at the zone center, in accord with experimental observations.
This hardens quickly towards the zone boundary.
There is also a very strong volume dependence of this mode, which is rapidly driven away from an instability by compression.
These results are discussed in relation to the thermal conductivity of the material.
PACS numbers: 63.20.dk,63.20.Ry,64.70.kg I. INTRODUCTION The thermoelectric performance of a material is quan- tiﬁed using a dimensionless, temperature dependent ﬁg- ure of merit, ZT = σS2T/κ, where σ is the electrical con- ductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity, and S is the ther- mopower.
Thus it is clear that high thermoelectric per- formance is generally found in materials with low thermal conductivity, and in fact various strategies for lowering thermal conductivity based on phonon scattering have been employed.
[1, 2, 3, 4] These include alloying to pro- duce mass disorder as in SiGe, the use of materials with large complex unit cells, and the use of materials with rattling ions, such as ﬁlled clathrate materials.
[4] In this regard rocksalt structure PbTe is a remarkable thermo- electric material.
It is based on a small, high symmetry unit cell, has high coordination of both atomic species (6- fold), and contains no obvious rattling ion.
Nonetheless, n-type PbTe has high values of ZT above room temper- ature and as such was used in spacecraft power genera- tors.
[5, 6] It also has low thermal conductivity, reported as 2.3 W/(m K) at ambient temperature.
[7] More re- cently, a family of so-called LAST compounds based on intergrowths of PbTe and AgxSbTe2 have been shown to have values of ZT well above unity, [8] and additionally quantum dot systems based on PbTe have also shown high values of ZT .
[9] Thermal properties of materials in general rest on the phonon dispersions.
While electronic and related prop- erties of PbTe has been rather extensively studied using ﬁrst principles methods, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] the phonon dispersions have not been reported.
The purpose of this paper is to report these dispersions, as obtained within density functional theory. II.
APPROACH The calculations reported here were done within the framework of density functional theory primarily using the local density approximation.
The quantum espresso code was used with norm conserving pseudopotentials to obtain the phonon dispersions via linear response.
[15] Convergence tests were performed to determine the needed planewave basis cut-oﬀand zone sampling.
The results shown used a planewave basis set with a 60 Ry cutoﬀand an 6x6x6 special k-points Brillouin zone sam- pling.
We performed convergence tests with a 75 Ry cutoﬀand an 8x8x8 special k-points Brillouin zone sam- pling but found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in phonon fre- quencies.
In addition, some calculations were done with the linearized augmented planewave (LAPW) method in- cluding local orbitals.
[16] These provide a check for the pseudopotential results.
Calculations were performed as a function of lattice parameter.
The calculated LAPW LDA lattice parameter is 6.39˚A, which is slightly more than 1% smaller than the experimental room tempera- ture lattice parameter of 6.464˚A, [17] and within 1% of the 120K value of 6.438˚A.
[18] For comparison the cal- culated LAPW lattice parameter within the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof [19] is 6.57˚A, which as is sometimes that case for ma- terials with heavy elements [20] is further from experi- ment than the LDA.
We therefore use the LDA, and per- form calculations as a function of lattice parameter.
As- suming that PbTe behaves like other materials with soft phonons, comparison with experiment should be done for the phonon dispersions calculated at the experimen- tal lattice parameter. [21]2 III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our main results are the phonon dispersions, which are given in Fig. 1.
As may be seen, PbTe is near a zone center phonon instability, associated with the transverse optic (TO) mode.
This is an inversion center breaking phonon, and would lead to a ferroelectric ground state if it were actually unstable.
This is not a surprising result and in particular is in accord with experimental stud- ies of NaCl structure group IV tellurides.
The related materials SnTe and GeTe are in fact ferroelectric, with rhombohedral ground states corresponding to freezing in of the soft TO mode with displacements along a [111] direction.
[22, 23, 24] The ferroelectricity of GeTe has been studied in de- tail using ﬁrst principles calculations by Rabe and co- workers, [25, 26, 27] who showed quantitative agreement between the predictions of LDA calculations and exper- iment.
Bussmann-Holder used model calculations to in- vestigate the phase diagrams of various alloys including PbTe-SnTe and PbTe-GeTe and made arguements for the nearness of PbTe to ferroelectricity.
[28] In fact it was known that PbTe shows a dielectric constant that increases at low T as well as a TO phonon mode that decreases in frequency as the temperature is lowered, [23, 29] although the detailed T dependence is compli- cated by a doping level dependence.
In any case, Burhard and co-workers [29] obtained obtained a very soft fre- quency of 17.5 cm−1 from optical measurements on PbTe ﬁlms.
This value is consistent with the very low value of 12 cm−1 that we obtain at the reported experimental lat- tice parameter.
This diﬀerence of ∼5 cm−1 is well within the usual errors of LDA calculations.
Comparing the two panels of Fig. 1, one may note a strong volume dependence of the TO phonon frequency around the zone center.
This frequency at Γ is plotted as a function of lattice parameter in Fig. 2.
As may be seen there is a very strong volume dependence to the soft TO mode.
Compressing the lattice parameter to 6.40 ˚A, which is less than 0.6% smaller than the 120K value, more than doubles the TO frequency from 12 cm−1 to 27 cm−1.
The LO mode on the other hand shows a quite ordinary, modest volume dependence.
While such strong volume dependences of soft mode phonon frequen- cies are unusual they have been noted before in complex oxide ferroelectrics, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BaTiO3 and KNbO3.
[21, 30, 31] The present results show that there is a similar behavior in PbTe in spite of the much simpler structure of this material in comparison with the oxide ferroelectrics.
Returning to the issue of the thermoelectric properties of PbTe, the material clearly does not involve alloying with diﬀerent mass ions or a large complex unit cell to lower thermal conductivity.
Furthermore, the acoustic modes are not anomalously soft.
One mechanism that has been discussed in the context of thermoelectric ma- terials is the use of so-called rattlers.
These are loosely bound atoms in a crystal structure that couple to the a) Compressed: a = 6.300Å b) Ambient (120K) a = 6.4384Å FIG.

One may ask then if there is an analogy be- tween the soft TO vibrations near the zone center and a material containing rattlers.
One such connection can be made based on the strong volume dependence.

3: Calculated energy as a function of phonon amplitude for the Γ point TO mode, with displacements along the tetrag- onal and rhombohedral directions for the experimental 300K lattice parameter of 6.464˚A.
The horizontal line corresponds to kT for T =300K. and so the strong volume dependence of the TO mode im- plies strong anharmonic coupling between the TO branch and the LA phonons.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the TO modes are highly anharmonic themselves.
Fig. 3 shows the calculated energy as a function of TO mode ampli- tude at the experimental volume.
As may be seen the energy surface remains very soft up to large amplitude ∼0.1 ˚A, and then starts to stiﬀen in a quite anharmonic way.
This may be seen, e.g. from the diﬀerence between [001] and [111] energies, which arises due to the anhar- monicity.
For large amplitudes the softest direction is [111] in agreement with the experimental ground state of GeTe.
However, even for [001] displacements the energy surface is very soft implying large amplitude vibrations even at room temperature.
However, it should be noted that the TO mode is only soft near the zone center, and so the mean square displacement will be less than that implied by the position of the kT =300K line on Fig. 3.
This also means that unlike rattling modes in clathrates, for example, the soft TO modes in PbTe are strongly k-dependent, similar to the acoustic modes.
IV. CONCLUSION While the above results do not provide a quantitative description of the thermal conductivity of PbTe they do show that there are unusual features of the phonon spec- trum that are generally associated with reduced thermal conductivity.
In particular we ﬁnd very soft TO phonon branches near the zone center as may be expected in a material near ferroelectricity.
Importantly, these modes are very volume dependent which implies strong anhar- monic coupling to longitudinal acoustic modes.
Further- more, although the TO modes are quite k-dependent, which is not an indicator of low thermal conductivity, they are also highly anharmonic, as seen from the Fig. 3.
This normally will lead to increased scattering at high temperature and accordingly reduced thermal conductiv- ity.
