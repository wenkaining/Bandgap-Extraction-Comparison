The neutron diffraction analysis, below TN (3.6 0.2K), reveals a  commensurate type-C antiferromagnetic structure with the ordered state magnetic moment of ~0.36  B/Ce-atom along the cubic <111> direction.
The analysis of the inelastic neutron scattering (INS)  data based on the crystal field (CF) model reveals a doublet ground state with a ground state  moment of 1.29 B/Ce-atom.
The observed magnetic moment from neutron diffraction, which is  small compared to the expected value from CF-analysis, is attributed to screening of the local Ce  moment by the Kondo effect.
This is supported by the observed Kondo-type resistivity and a small  change in the entropy of Ce8Pd24Ga at TN.
The zero-field muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a sharp  increase below TN indicating ordering of Ce moments, in agreement with the neutron diffraction  data.
The present studies reveal that the physical properties of Ce8Pd24Ga are governed by the  onsite Kondo compensation, the moment stabilizing intersite RKKY interaction and the crystal  field effect.

INTRODUCTION   Studies of Ce-based heavy fermion compounds are of fundamental importance for understanding  their complex magnetic and transport properties.
A number of recent discoveries have led to the  resurgence of interest in the properties of the binary compounds which crystallise in the well  known cubic Cu3Au-type structure.1-4 Among these, CeIn3 and CePd3 exhibit interesting properties.
CeIn3 shows antiferromagnetic ordering with TN = 10 K at ambient pressure, and becomes  superconducting with TC=0.175 K at a pressure of 2.55 GPa.1 On the other hand CePd3 is a  canonical intermediate valence compound which has been extensively investigated using many  experimental techniques.5-8 Despite of a low carrier density, 0.3 electrons per formula unit, the low  temperature properties of CePd3 are consistent with a simple Fermi-liquid ground state.9 The  commonality between CeIn3 and CePd3 is the presence of a broad peak in the resistivity, at 70 K  and 150 K respectively, indicating the onset of a coherent Kondo lattice ground state.
In heavy fermion compounds the stability of the magnetic ordered state depends on a delicate  balance between the long-range intermoment coupling driven by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yosida (RKKY) interaction and the on-site Kondo hybridization between the 4f electrons and the  conduction electrons.10,11 The strength of both the RKKY and Kondo interactions depends on the  coupling parameter ( J), TRKKY ~ ( J)2 and TK ~ exp(-1/ J ), where J is the exchange parameter  and    is the density of states of the conduction electrons at the Fermi level.
In the strong coupling  limit, the so-called intermediate valence state as found in CePd3, the ground state is non-magnetic.
In this case both charge and spin fluctuations play an important role in the physical properties of  the materials.
For the medium to weak coupling limit, known as the heavy fermion regime, there  can be a variety of interesting ground states, including reduced moment modulated  antiferromagnetism, a zero temperature quantum critical point (QCP), unconventional  superconductivity, and anomalous ferromagnetism.
In this case the physical properties are  governed by the spin fluctuations only.
The coupling strength is generally related to the number of  holes in the s-p or d-like outer shells of a given ligand and to its distance with respect to the Ce  ions.12,13 By decreasing the number of these holes it is possible to dehybridize the 4f states leading  to a dramatic change in the magnetic and transport properties of the material.
Such a  dehybridization effect in CePd3 has been observed when the compound was alloyed with an  appropriate ligand or by introduction of small atoms such as B, Si or Ge at the interstitial site in the  Cu3Au unit cell.14-18 The interstitial impurities cause a dramatic cross-over from archetypal  intermediate valence behaviour in CePd3 to local moment character as seen through resistivity,  magnetic susceptibility and inelastic neutron scattering studies.14-18    The crystal structure, magnetic and transport properties of Ce8Pd24Ga have been investigated by  various groups.3,19-22 This compound is closely related to CePd3 as the title compound may also be  written CePd3Ga0.125.
Our recent high resolution neutron powder diffraction study at 300 K on3  Ce8Pd24Ga revealed that the crystal structure is composed of distorted perovskite and Cu3Au  subcells arranged with the perovskite like units centred on the corners of the cube.21 In the present  work we have investigated the magnetic ground state of Ce8Pd24Ga using neutron powder  diffraction and muon spin relaxation ( SR) measurements below and above TN.
The results of our  inelastic neutron scattering data21 are discussed in the context of the  studies presented here.   II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS   A polycrystalline sample (mass ~ 20 g) of Ce8Pd24Ga was prepared by arc melting the  stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements with purity 99.9% on a water-cooled copper  hearth under high purity argon atmosphere.
The ingot was turned over and remelted several times  to ensure homogeneity.
The neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and muon  measurements were carried out at ISIS the pulsed neutron and muon source at Rutherford Appleton  Laboratory, UK.
Temperature dependent lattice parameters were measured between 4 K and 300 K  using the high resolution neutron powder diffractometer HRPD.
The magnetic structure was  investigated as low as 1.9 K using the medium resolution neutron diffractometer ROTAX that  views a cold methane moderator making the instrument suitable for magnetic structure studies.
For  both the ROTAX and HRPD diffraction experiments polycrystalline sample material was filled  into a cylindrical vanadium sample container of 11 mm diameter (a flat plate type Al-sample  holder was used for HRPD) and mounted in a standard ‘orange-type’ He-cryostat.
Both HRPD and  ROTAX are equipped with 3 detector banks, each of which provides neutron diffraction data in a  distinct d-spacing and resolution range.
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out  using the time-of-flight spectrometer HET using an incident neutron energy of 40 meV. The  Ce8Pd24Ga sample was cooled down to the lowest possible temperature of about 17 K in a closed- cycle refrigerator.
Zero field  +SR measurements were carried on the MuSR spectrometer between  1.5 K and 6 K in a standard He-cryostat.
The sample was mounted on an Al-sample holder with a  silver mask.
The neutron and  SR measurements were performed on the same sample of  Ce8Pd24Ga.   III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   A. Neutron diffraction   The neutron powder diffraction studies show that down to the lowest temperature of 1.9 K  Ce8Pd24Ga crystallises in the cubic structure with space group Pm-3m (no. 221), in agreement with  our previous room temperature structurual analysis.21 It is to be noted that the unit-cell of  Ce8Pd24Ga is obtained by doubling the unit-cell of CePd3 in all three cubic directions.
The  refinement of the site occupancies shows that the Ce and Pd sites are fully occupied, while the Ga  site is only 78(4)% occupied.
A detailed description of the crystal structure refinement and the4  crystallographic parameters at 300 K was given earlier.21 Figure 1 shows the temperature  dependence of the cubic lattice parameter obtained from Rietveld analysis.
The lattice parameter  decreases linearly with temperature from 300 K and becomes nearly temperature independent at  low temperatures (below 15K), a typical behaviour expected for a system with thermally excited  phonons.
The temperature dependence of the lattice parameter was analysed using an Einstein  expression of the form a(T)=a0+ /[exp( E/T)-1], where a0 is the lattice parameter at 0 K,    is the  Einstein constant, and  E is an effective Einstein temperature.
The solid line in Figure 1 shows the  resultant fit.
The fitted parameters are: a0=8.3669(1) Å, =0.0170(2) Å and  E =157(5) K. The  Einstein model yields a reasonable fit to the data over the entire temperature range suggesting that  the electronic contribution to the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter is small.
We  have estimated the Grüneisen parameter,    ~ 1.73 for Ce8Pd24Ga, using the above values of   and  E, and taking a typical value of the bulk modulus ~1Mbar.
Figure 2 shows the ROTAX forward scattering neutron powder diffraction pattern of Ce8Pd24Ga  collected at 1.9 K.
At this temperature extra pure magnetic reflections with small intensities, such  as (110) at a d-spacing of 5.95 Å, are observed in addition to the nuclear reflections.
There are also  additional small magnetic intensities observed on top of nuclear peaks, such as (211) (see inset  Figure 2).
These additional magnetic Bragg intensities are assumed to arise from the  antiferromagnetic ordering of Ce3+ moments at 1.9 K, in agreement with the heat capacity and  resistivity measurements.20,21 The observed magnetic reflections can be indexed on the basis of the  crystallographic unit cell of Ce8Pd24Ga, i.e. with the wave vector q=(0, 0, 0).
It is important to note  that the same magnetic peaks can be indexed with respect to a smaller cubic CePd3-type unit cell  with a propagation vector [½, ½, 0].
This type of order was labelled type-C antiferromagnetic  structure of a primitive cubic lattice earlier.23 In the Ce8Pd24Ga setting the Ce atoms occupy site  8g, site symmetry 3m, that leads to the admissible magnetic site symmetry 3m’ restricting the Ce  moments to directions along the 3-fold axis along <111>.24 The corresponding magnetic space  group is Pm3m’25 corresponding to a triple-q structure model in terms of the [½, ½, 0] propagation  vector, thus preserving the cubic symmetry.
This non-collinear model, which has magnetic  moments oriented along symmetry-equivalent <111> directions, represents the highest possible  symmetry for the magnetic structure for fitting the magnetic intensities with one structure  parameter only, i.e. the magnetic moment magnitude of the Ce3+ ions.
This magnetic structure  cannot be discriminated by the diffraction experiments from other models of lower symmetry, e.g.  a single-q structure.
The restriction of the number of variable parameters was a main consideration  for the model setup in view of the very weak observed magnetic powder diffraction intensities.
The  proposed structure takes into account the averaging of magnetic intensities over magnetic domains.
The magnetic moment refinement of Ce8Pd24Ga was performed with the program GSAS,26 using  diffraction patterns from the three banks in a Rietveld refinement.
The magnetic form factor of  Ce3+ was calculated in dipole approximation using analytical approximations as tabulated in the  International Tables for Crystallography.27 The resultant Rietveld fit of the forward scattering bank5  data is shown in Figure 2.
The refined moment value is 0.36(2) B/Ce-atom.
A schematic  representation of the magnetic structure of Ce8Pd24Ga is displayed in Figure 3.
The magnetic  moment magnitude as a function of temperature is plotted in Figure 4.
The magnetic moment of the  Ce ion is saturated at low temperatures and almost constant at about 0.35  B/Ce-atom between 1.9  K and 3 K, rapidly dropping off to zero as the transition temperature is approached.
Moment values  of 0.2  B, corresponding to moment components of 0.1  B  along the cubic axes, are close to the  detection limit of the powder diffraction experiment.
Figure 4 also compares the temperature  variation of the magnetic moment with a phenomenological power-law behaviour28  (T) ~ (1 -  d) , where    =T/TN with TN=3.6 K,  where =0.43 is taken from the muon spin relaxation  measurements (see below) and where a value of d=10 ensures saturation of the magnetic moment  curve below 3 K. The slightly higher value of TN =3.6 K obtained for the neutron diffraction  sample of Ce8Pd24Ga (mass 20 g), compared to TN=3.1 K reported through the heat capacity and  resistivity measurements (mass 5 g),20,21 may be due to different Ga site occupancies in the  different samples.
B. Inelastic neutron scattering   Figure 5a shows the magnetic inelastic response from Ce8Pd24Ga measured on HET at 17 K. The  phonon scattering has been subtracted using a standard scaling method.21,29 We observed two well- defined crystal field (CF) excitations at energies of 3.2 meV and 12.8 meV, corresponding to  transitions from the ground state doublet to the two excited CF doublets.
It is noteworthy that the  inelastic response of CePd3 does not show any sign of CF excitations, instead it exhibits a gap type  response below 20 meV (i.e. no magnetic scattering) and a broad q-independent peak centred at 65  meV with a linewidth of 68 meV.29,30 This is a typical response observed in valence-fluctuating  systems, in which the strong hybridization between localised 4f electrons and conduction electrons  is present.31 The presence of well defined CF excitations in Ce8Pd24Ga indicates that the strength  of hybridization has reduced considerably.
This is further supported by the dramatic reduction in  Kondo temperature from 150 K for CePd3 to 5.8 K for Ce8Pd24Ga.
The point symmetry of the Ce  site in Ce8Pd24Ga is trigonal, 3m. This gives two additional terms in the cubic CF Hamiltonian of   the Ce3+ ion with J=5/2   HCF=B2 0O2 0+B4 0O4 0+B4 3O4 3             (1)   where Bn m are the crystal field parameters and On m are the Stevens operator equivalents.32 HCF has  only three independent CF parameters, thus the positions and relative intensities of the two CF  excitations are sufficient to estimate a unique set of CF parameters.
The values of the CF  parameters obtained from the least-squares fit to the INS data are (in meV): B2 0=0.551(5),  B4 0=0.024(2), and B4 3=0.208(4).
The solid line in Figure 5a represents the fitted response with this  set of CF parameters, which agrees well with the observed magnetic response.
Figure 5b represents6  the crystal-electric-field energy level scheme of the Ce3+ ions in Ce8Pd24Ga with the above set of  CF parameters.
The ground state is   3/2 , which makes Ce8Pd24Ga an Ising system.
The  calculated value of the ground state magnetic moment, < 1 gJJz 1 > (where gJ is the Landé g- factor), is 1.29  B.
By applying the CEF theory in the lowest order approximation, the  magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy Ea can be expressed in term of the second-order CEF  parameter B2 0 as follows                                                               Ea=-3/2 B2 0  <3Jz 2 - J(J+1)> sin2            (2)   where    is the angle between the easy magnetization direction and the z-axis (i.e. the crystal  electric field axis, which is <111> in the present case).
The observed positive sign of B2 0 indicates  that the magnetic moment is along the <111> direction in Ce8Pd24Ga, which is in agreement with  the neutron diffraction analysis.
C. Zero field muon spin relaxation   The zero field muon spin relaxation is a unique technique and has played an important role to  investigate dynamical fluctuations and static inhomogeneities in reduced moment heavy fermion  systems.33 In order to shed more light on the nature of the magnetic ground state in Ce8Pd24Ga,  zero field SR measurements have been carried out on a polycrystalline sample below and above  TN. Figure.
6 shows zero field SR spectra from Ce8Pd24Ga measured at various temperatures.
The  zero field SR spectra show a very small depolarization rate in the paramagnetic state, while below  3.8 K an onset of strong muon depolarization is observed, which is in agreement with the  antiferromagnetic ordering observed by neutron diffraction.
Surprisingly, even well below the  magnetic ordering temperature there is no clear sign of a coherent oscillation in the zero field SR  spectra that would give evidence of a muon spin precession around a static internal magnetic field.
A very similar situation has been observed for the antiferromagnet YbCu3Al2 (TN=2 K) and  ferromagnetic CePdSb (TC=17.5 K).34,35 This might suggest that the average dipolar field,  experienced by the muon spins at the muon stopping site, is equal to zero in Ce8Pd24Ga.
In this  scenario the sharp increase of the muon depolarization rate observed below TN in Ce8Pd24Ga could  be understood  as a result of the distribution of internal fields with zero mean at the muon site.
In the paramagnetic state the zero field SR spectra are well described using a product of a  temperature-independent Kubo-Toyabe (KT) function, arising from the Ga and Pd nuclear  moments, and an exponential relaxing function (ERF), exp(- 1t), representing the additional muon  depolarization due to fluctuating electronic 4f-magnetic moments.
The dynamic relaxation rate,  1,  is related to the interaction amplitude and to the rate of the spin fluctuations.
In our analysis, we  have also added a small time and temperature independent background contribution (abg=0.026,  estimated from the spectra at 1.6 K) arising from muon stopping in the silver mask.
Fits to data  collected at temperatures above TN yield good agreement between observed and calculated spectra7  as shown in Figure 6.
The estimated KT relaxation rate is  KT=0.0306 s-1.
The comparison of this  value for  KT with the calculated value from the second moment of the internal nuclear dipole field  distribution across the unit-cell of Ce8Pd24Ga indicates that the muons are localised at the (0, ¼, ¼)  site.
However, the above mentioned functional form does not fit the data collected below TN.
Data  modelling with various forms of alternative, single component muon spin relaxation functions did  not result in satisfactory fits of the data below TN.
The spectra could be best fitted over the entire  temperature range by adding a second component to the product of KT and ERF for the  temperature regime below TN:                                Gz(T) = GKT ( KT, t) [ a1 exp(- 1t)  +  a2 (1/3+2/3 exp(-( 2t)2)) ] + abg             (3)   where GKT( KT, t) is the well-known Kubo-Toyabe function33 and the asymmetry parameter a2  preceding the additonal second term.
The first and third terms are also used for fitting above TN  whereas the second term contributes below TN only.
The functional form of the second term has  been suggested for a muon stopping site of high symmetry in an antiferromagnetic matrix.36  At  such a site the mean field is zero.
From the neutron powder diffraction experiments it follows that  22(4)% of the Ga site is vacant in Ce8Pd24Ga, hence one expect a different value of moment for the  Ce atoms around this vacant site, which justifies to use the second term and, hence, the two  components model in our analysis.
In the analysis, the values of total asymmetry, a=a1+a2, abg and  KT were kept fixed.
The temperature dependent relaxation rates,  1 and   2, and asymmetries, a1  and a2, obtained from the fits are displayed in Figure 7a and 7b.
Below TN   2  increases sharply on  cooling, while  1 shows a very weak temperature dependence (Figure 7a).
On the other hand, the  asymmetry a2 decreases sharply when the temperature is raised towards TN, accompanied by a  compensation rise of a1 (Figure 7b).
These types of two components in the muon depolarization  rate have been also observed in antiferromagnetic CeAl2 and the heavy fermion YbBiPt.33 The  presence of two components has been attributed to two types of domains in these materials.
In  Ce8Pd24Ga the fast depolarization rate ( 2) is associated with the magnetic ordered domain, while  the slow depolarization rate ( 1) is associated with the paramagnetic domain.
The asymmetry (or  amplitudes) of the fast component (a2) represents the magnetic volume fraction, and the asymmetry  of the slowly damped component (a1) reflects the paramagnetic volume fraction.
The volume  fractions of magnetic and paramagnetic domains at 3.1 K (1.6 K) are 77% (88%) and 23% (12%),  respectively.
These values agree with the fractional occupancy of the Ga site (78%) obtained from  the high resolution neutron powder diffraction measurements.
This indicates that the Ce ions  adjacent to Ga vacancies remain paramagnetic below TN.
The temperature dependence of  2 has been modelled using the same functional power-law term  that was plotted with the ordered magnetic moment in Figure 4, namely  2(T) ~ (1 -  d)   (Figure  7a), yielding TN=3.51(1) K, =0.429(1) and d=2.05(2).
The value of TN obtained from the muon  data is in agreement with that obtained from the neutron diffraction study.
The phenomenological8  parameter of d=2.05, reflecting spin-wave excitations, 28 is very close to 2 predicted for a cubic  antiferromagnetic system.
37 We do not clearly understand at present the disagreement with the  much higher value of d=10 employed to obtain a saturated ordered magnetic moment below 3 K  (Figure 4).
One of the reasons could be a few data points with a large errors near TN in the  diffraction data. IV.
CONCLUSIONS   In the present study, we have investigated the antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice compound  Ce8Pd24Ga using neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and zero-field muon spin  relaxation measurements.
The chemical formula of the title compound can also be written as  CePd3Ga0.125 in order to make a direct comparison with CePd3.
The present study reveals that the  physical properties of CePd3 change strongly with the incorporation of the Ga atom into the cubic  cell.
The change of the physical properties could be attributed to the dehybridization of Ce-4f and  Pd-4d electrons as a result of the shorter bond-length (2.453 Å) between Pd-Ga atom, that produces  a strong overlap between the p-electrons of the Ga and d-electrons of the Pd, and hence the strong  dehybridization in Ce8Pd24Ga.
The effect of dehybridization is clearly seen through the drastic  change in the Kondo temperature (TK), 150 K for CePd3 and 5.8 K for Ce8Pd24Ga.21 The  observation of the magnetic ordering in Ce8Pd24Ga is consistent with the prediction by Doniach’s  phase diagram, which reveals that with reducing the hybridization (or the coupling constant, J),  the Kondo temperature decreases and the magnetic ordering temperature increases.
Furthermore,  the observation of well defined crystal field excitations in Ce8Pd24Ga indicates that the Ce ions are  in the localized state.
The neutron diffraction study of Ce8Pd24Ga shows that the Ce magnetic moment in the order state  is ~0.36  B/Ce-atom, compared with the predicted CF ground state moment 1.29  B/Ce-atom from  the crystal field eigenstate, which clearly indicates the reduced moment magnetic ordering.
The  study of reduced moment magnetic ordering in Ce, Yb and U-based heavy fermion compounds is  an active area of research in the field of heavy fermion systems.
This type of reduced moment  antiferromagnetic ordering has been observed in Ce(Ni0.65Pd0.25)2Ge2, with an estimated ordered  state moment of 0.55  B/Ce-atom, and in the heavy fermion antiferromagnetic superconductor UPt3  (Tc=0.5 K and TN=5 K), with an estimated ordered state moment of 0.02  B/U-atom.38,39 The  presence of the Kondo effect in Ce8Pd24Ga has been confirmed through the temperature  dependence resistivity, the scaling behaviour of the magnetoresistance, and the observed small  entropy change, 16.4 J mole-1 K-1 compared with the 8RLn(2)=46.1 J mole-1 K-1 expected from a  doublet CF ground state.20,21 Therefore, the origin of the reduced moment ordering in Ce8Pd24Ga is  attributed to the screening of the local 4f-moment by the conduction electrons by forming a  Kondo-singlet state.
The energy gain due to the singlet formation is KBTK.
It should be noted that  below 8 K Ce8Pd24Ga shows an onset of the coherence in the resistivity, i.e. Kondo lattice9  behaviour, implying the importance of interactions between the magnetic ions of the lattice.
In this  scenario, while gaining the energy through the singlet formation, the system is also losing the  magnetic interaction energy between the sites.
This implies that the singlet formation should not be  fully complete when the intersite interaction is sufficiently strong, and hence the system orders  magnetically with a reduced magnetic moment.
This is because the fully Kondo compensation of  the 4f-moments would lead to an overall loss of energy instead of an energy gain.
Thus, the Kondo  compensation model explains the reduced moment magnetic ordering in Ce8Pd24Ga.

Rev. Letter 63, 676 (1989).11  Figure captions   Figure 1: Temperature variation of the lattice parameter of Ce8Pd24Ga which has been modelled     using an Einstein expression (solid line).
Figure 2:  Forward scattering neutron diffraction pattern of Ce8Pd24Ga collected on ROTAX at     1.9 K, with observed (symbols), calculated (line) and difference patterns (lower curve)     obtained by a Rietveld refinement of nuclear and magnetic structure parameters.
The     inset shows the enlarged diffraction in a d-spacing range between 3-7 Å. N and M mark     the positions of nuclear and magnetic Bragg intensities, respectively.
Figure 3:  Schematic of the proposed magnetic structure of Ce8Pd24Ga.
The magnetic moments     vectors are aligned along <111> directions.
Ce moments in [110] and [1–10] sheets      point into the upper and lower corners of the unit cell, respectively, in line with the C-    type structure and  a [½, ½, 0] propagation direction with respect to a CePd3-type cell.
Figure 4:  Temperature dependence of magnetic Ce moment in Ce8Pd24Ga, obtained from the      Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction data.
The solid line represents a power-law     behaviour with TN=3.6 K and  =0.42  (see text).
Figure 5a: Magnetic response from Ce8Pd24Ga at 17 K (symbols) measured on the HET      spectrometer, the data summed over the scattering angles between 8° and 30°.
The  solid     line represents the fit based on the crystal field model (see text).
Figure 5b: Crystal field energy level scheme of Ce8Pd24Ga with eigenstates.
Figure 6:  Zero-field SR spectra of Ce8Pd24Ga at temperatures above and below TN.
The      solid lines represent fits to the data (see text).
The inset shows the spectra at small time                    for 1.6K.   Figure 7a: Temperature dependence of the zero-field muon spin relaxation rate,  1 and  2.
The     solid line represents a power-law fit (see text).
The inset shows  1 versus temperature                     plotted with  an expanded y-scale.
Figure 7b: Temperature dependent asymmetry of two components.
Note that the total asymmetry     was kept fixed during the analysis.
The dotted line lines are guid to the eye.12  Figure 113  Figure 214       Figure 3 Figure 4  Temperature (K)15     Figure  5a  0.98 5/2 0.22 1/2 0.98 1/2 0.22 5/2 3/2 3.4 meV 12.8 meV Figure 5b16   Figure 6  Figure 7a and 7b  Zero-field Relaxation Rate ( s-1) 0 2 4 6 8 10 Temperature (K) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Asymmetry 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.00 0.08 0.16 0.24 1 2 Ce8Pd24Ga Time ( s) 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.0 0.1 0.2 Asymmetry 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.0 0.1 0.2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.0 0.1 0.2 Asymmetry 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.0 0.1 0.2 Ce8Pd24Ga 5K 3.1K 2.8K 2K 1.6K 3.4K 3.8K 0 1 2This document was created with Win2PDF available at http://www.daneprairie.com.
