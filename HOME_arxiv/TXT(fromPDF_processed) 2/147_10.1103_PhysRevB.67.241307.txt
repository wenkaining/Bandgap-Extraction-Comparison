We argue that these excitons can be realized very simply with self-assembled quantum dots, using the wetting layer as host for the Fermi sea.
We show that a tunnel hybridization of a charged exciton with the Fermi sea leads to two striking eﬀects in the optical spectra.
First, the photoluminescence lines become strongly dependent on the vertical bias.
Secondly, if the exciton spin is nonzero, the Kondo eﬀect leads to peculiar photoluminescence line shapes with a line width determined by the Kondo temperature.
1The Kondo eﬀect concerns the interaction of a localized spin with a Fermi sea of electrons [1].
It is a crucial eﬀect in various areas of nanophysics where often a nano-sized object with spin is in close proximity to a metal [2].
Semiconductor nanostructures are ideal for investigations of Kondo physics because, in contrast to metals, their properties are voltage- tunable [3].
Characteristic to the Kondo eﬀect are a screening of the localized spin and a resonance in the quasi-particle density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy.
This leads to a maximum in conductance at very low temperatures in the transport through a spin- 1 2 quantum dot [4].
So far, the Kondo eﬀect in nanostructures has been studied almost exclusively in relation to transport properties.
In optics, Kondo eﬀects have only been discussed theoretically with respect to nonlinear and shake-up processes in a quantum dot [5, 6].
We present here the theory of novel eﬀects which arise from a combination of the Kondo eﬀect and the optics of nanostructures.
In our model, a charged exciton in a quantum dot (QD) interacts with a Fermi sea of free electrons.
We call the resulting quasi-particles Kondo-excitons.
We suggest that such novel excitons can exist in self-assembled quantum dots where charged excitons can be prepared in voltage-tunable structures [7].
Furthermore, the wetting layer can be ﬁlled with electrons and used as a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas (ﬁg. 1a), oﬀering a simple means of generating a Fermi sea in close proximity to a quantum dot.
A signiﬁcant point is that self-assembled dots are very small, only a few nanometers in diameter, allowing the Kondo temperature TK to be as high as ∼10 K. We ﬁnd that the photoluminescence (PL) from Kondo excitons is determined by the Kondo DOS at the Fermi level such that the PL line width is equal to kBTK (kB is the Boltzmann constant).
Furthermore, the PL energy depends strongly on the Fermi energy, and therefore also on a bias voltage.
This behavior contrasts with conventional single dot PL where the lines are very sharp depending only weakly through the Stark eﬀect on the bias [7].
In voltage-tunable structures, self-assembled QDs are embedded between two contacts [7, 8].
This makes it possible to control the number of electrons in a QD by application of a voltage Ug (ﬁg. 1a) [8].
By generating a hole with optical excitation, it has been demonstrated that there are regions of gate voltage with constant excitonic charge, with the excitonic charge changing abruptly at particular values of Ug [7].
The charged excitons, labelled Xn−, contain n + 1 electrons and one hole.
Excitons with n up to 3 have been observed in InAs/GaAs quantum dots [7, 9].
At higher voltages, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy shows that electrons ﬁll the 2D wetting layer [8].
In this case, the Fermi energy (EF) in the wetting layer depends linearly on Ug: we ﬁnd that EF = (a∗ o/4d)(Ug −Uo g ), where a∗ o is the eﬀective Bohr radius, d is the distance between the back gate and wetting layer, Uo g is the threshold gate voltage at which electrons start to ﬁll the wetting layer, and d ≫a∗ o [8].
Existing PL results in the regime of wetting layer ﬁlling show broadenings and shifts of the PL lines [7], which we believe is some evidence of an interaction with the Fermi sea, although this has not been analyzed in detail.
Typically, the QD X0 and X1−excitons are strongly bound and exist only at gate voltages 2d l Ugate dot back-gate front-gate a) d l Ugate dot 2D electrons of wetting layer back-gate front-gate a) 0 -Eg -Udot PL tunnel b) Ε F FIG.

where the wetting layer is empty.
It is therefore unlikely that X0 and X1−can couple with the Fermi sea.
Instead, we focus on the excitons X2−and X3−for which the electrons on the upper state may couple with extended states of the Fermi sea as we illustrate in ﬁg. 1b.
Since self-assembled QDs are usually anisotropic, we model a QD with two bound non-degenerate orbital states, having indexes s and p.
For a p state electron, the electrostatic potential consists of the QD short-range conﬁnement and the long-range Coulomb repulsion from the charges in the lower s state.
This potential will therefore have a barrier at the edge of the QD (ﬁg. 1a), allowing the p electron(s) to tunnel in and out of the QD.
To investigate the interaction between a quantum dot exciton and a Fermi sea of electrons, we employ the Anderson Hamiltonian which includes the single-particle energy ˆHsp, the intra-dot Coulomb interaction, and a hybridization term ˆHtun: ˆH = ˆHsp + 1 2 X α1,α2,α3,α4 Uee α1,α2,α3,α4a+ α1a+ α2aα3aα4 − X α1,α2,α3,α4 Ueh α1,α2,α3,α4a+ α1b+ α2bα3aα4 + ˆHtun, (1) where a+ α (b+ α) is the intra-dot creation operator of electrons (holes); Uee and Ueh are electron- electron and electron-hole Coulomb potential matrix elements, respectively.
The index α stands for (β, σ), where β is the orbital index and σ the spin index; β can be s or p, and σ = ±1 2 for electrons and ±3 2 for heavy holes.
ˆHtun is given by: ˆHtun = P σ Vk[c+ k,σap,σ + a+ p,σck,σ], where the operators ck,σ describe the delocalized electrons in the Fermi sea; k and Ek are the 2D momentum and kinetic energy, respectively.
For the tunnel matrix element Vk, we assume Vk = V in the interval 0 < Ek < D and Vk = 0 elsewhere [10].
In the operator ˆHtun, we include only coupling between the p state and the Fermi sea.

The energy EF plays the role of the Fermi level.
Here, Udot = 64 meV and Eg is the band gap of the QD.
(b) Electron conﬁgurations contributing to the initial ground state.
Electron (hole) spins are represented with solid (open) triangles.
the quantization in a QD is assumed to be strong so that the Coulomb interactions can be included with perturbation theory [11, 12].
The tunnel broadening is the smallest energy in the problem.
Our approach is to solve eq. 1 for the initial and ﬁnal states, and calculate the optical emission spectrum at zero temperature: I(ω) = Re Z ∞ 0 dte−iωt < i| ˆV + o (t) ˆVo(0)|i >, where |i > is the initial state and the operator ˆVo = Vopt(bs,−3 2as,↑+ bs, 3 2as,↓+ c.c.) describes the strong transitions between the hole and electron s states.
We start with a zero bandwidth model, in which the Fermi sea is replaced by a single “delocalized” state of energy EF [1].
In this simpliﬁed model, EF plays the role of the Fermi level allowing us to predict the main features in the evolution of the PL with Fermi energy.
We describe the electron wave function with the occupations of the electron states, labelling the delocalized state e.
The aim is explore the hybridization of the X2−and X3− excitons, so we consider 4 electrons and one hole.
We take the hole angular momentum as + 3 2 (denoted s+ 3 2); equivalent results are obtained also with −3 2.
The electron wave function of the hybridized initial state before photon emission will have total electron spin Se = 0.
We therefore express the ground state as |i >= A1|i1 > +A2|i2 >, where: |i1 > = 1 √ 2(|s↑, s↓, p↑, e↓> −|s↑, s↓, p↓, e↑>)|s+ 3 2 >, |i2 > = |s↑, s↓, p↑, p↓> |s+ 3 2 > .
4The states |i1 > and |i2 > correspond to the excitons X2−and X3−, respectively (ﬁg. 2), and have energies Ei1 and Ei2.
In the Kondo function |i1 >, the delocalized electron “screens” the net spin in the QD.
By diagonalising the Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd that the initial ground state has energy Ei = 1 2(Ei1 + Ei2 − q (Ei1 −Ei2)2 + 8V 2) and that A1 = −a/(1 + a2)1/2, A2 = −A1/a, where a = (Ei2 −Ei)/ √ 2V .
As the energy EF increases, the ground state evolves from the X2−to the X3−exciton.
The transition occurs when Ei1 ≈Ei2 where EF ≈E1→2 = Eintra 2 −Eintra 1 where Eintra 1 and Eintra 2 are the intra-dot energies.
The hybridization between |i1 > and |i2 > corresponds to the so-called mixed-valence regime [1].
To calculate Ei numerically, we represent a QD as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator taking the electron (hole) oscillator frequencies as 25 and 20 (12.5 and 10) meV. Fig. 2a shows Ei as a function of EF.
After photon emission from state |i >, the ﬁnal state |f > has Se = 1 2.
The intra- dot conﬁguration in the X2−ﬁnal state is either a singlet (Sdot = 0), with conﬁguration 1 √ 2(|s↑, p↓> −|s↓, p↑>), or a triplet (Sdot = 1), with conﬁgurations |s↑, p↑> and 1 √ 2(|s↑, p↓> +|s↓, p↑>) [7] (Fig. 3a).
The PL related to these conﬁgurations are well separated, typically by ∼5 meV [7, 9], due to the exchange interaction between the s and p states.
Non-zero optical matrix elements exist for the three ﬁnal states: |f1 > = 1 √ 6(|s↑, p↓, e↑> +|s↓, p↑, e↑> −2|s↑, p↑, e↓>), |f2 > = 1 √ 2(|s↑, p↓, e↑> −|s↓, p↑, e↑>), |f3 > = |s↑, p↑, p↓> .
In the state |f1 >, the intra-dot triplet state with Sdot = 1 is “screened” by the delocalized electron.
|f2 > has the singlet intra-dot state, and the function |f3 > plays the main role in the emission of the X3−exciton.
The calculated PL spectrum contains three lines (Fig. 3), labelled as X2− t , X2− s and X3−, with relative intensities 3 4A2 1 : 1 4A2 1 : A2 2.
Without the tunnel interaction, there is an abrupt jump in the PL from X2−to X3−, but with the tunnel interaction, the PL shows very clearly hybridization eﬀects.
In particular, in the mixed-valence regime EF ≈E1→2, the intensity of the X2−lines rapidly decrease and the X3−line appears but the energies of all three lines depend on the delocalized state energy EF.
Hence, a clear prediction is that in the hybridization regime, the PL depends on the Fermi energy and therefore also on the gate voltage.
We focus now on the PL line shapes in the Kondo regime EF < E1→2.
While the zero bandwidth model is adequate for the general picture of the PL, we have to employ the ﬁnite bandwidth model in order to calculate the PL line shapes.
The initial Kondo state is the exciton X2−coupled with the Fermi sea.

The conﬁgurations are described with the lo- calized states and with the symbol Ωwhich denotes all states of the Fermi sea with k < kF, where kF is the Fermi momentum.
From the Anderson Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd that [1]: Ak = − √ 2V A0 Eintra 1 + Ek −Ei , A0 = 1 (1 + 2∆/πδ)1/2, where ∆= πV 2ρ (ρ is the 2D DOS).
We write the ground state energy as Ei = Eintra 1 +EF −δ, where δ is the lowering of energy due to the Kondo eﬀect.
If δ < E1→2 −EF, we obtain δ = (D −EF) exp   −π(Eintra 2 −Eintra 1 −EF) 2∆ ! = kBTK.
(3) Here, the energy δ plays the role of the Kondo temperature in the initial state, TK.
The temperature TK can be as high as ∼7 −14 K for realistic parameters EF = 2 −3.6 meV, ∆= 1 meV, and D ∼30 meV.
In the regime EF < E1→2, the ﬁnal intra-dot conﬁguration is either a singlet or a triplet state (ﬁg. 3a), as in the case of the zero bandwidth calculation.
The triplet state couples with the Fermi gas, leading to a state with total electron spin Se = 1 2.
However, the Kondo 6k φ ≡ 0 φ ≡ a) b) ΕF Εk FIG.

The Fermi energies of 2 and 3.6 meV correspond to KTK = 7 and 14 K, respectively.
temperature for this ﬁnal state turns out to be much less than TK allowing us to use the single-particle ﬁnal states to calculate the PL spectrum.
The singlet ﬁnal state, and also the X3−ﬁnal state, have higher energy and are broadened by energy ∆through tunnelling into empty delocalized states.
From state |i > in eq. 2, we write the spectral function I(ω) in the form: I(ω) = −Re[i X β,β′ AβAβ′Fβ,β′], where β can be either 0 or k, Fββ′ =< φβ| ˆV + o ˆR ˆVo|φβ′ >, and ˆR = 1/( ˆH + ¯hω −Ei −i0).
We ﬁnd that the X2− t PL line has an asymmetric shape (Fig. 4): X2− t (ω) = V 2 opt 3∆A2 0 2π Z D−EF 0 dǫ 1 (ǫ + kBTK)2Re −i ¯hω −E′(X2− t ) + ǫ −iγ , (4) where E′(X2− t ) = E(X2− t ) −kBTK is the renormalized emission energy and γ describes the broadening of the ﬁnal state.
We can expect γ to be small since the relaxation of the ﬁnal state requires a spin-ﬂip [7], and in this case, kBTK ≫γt, PL line width is equal to KTK.
In other words, the PL reﬂects the spectral DOS near the Fermi level in the initial Kondo state.
The important result is that in the Kondo regime, both the PL peak position and the PL line shape depend on the Fermi energy and, hence, on the gate voltage.
Furthermore, as the temperature increases, the peak in the spectral DOS diminishes rapidly [1] and therefore the line width of the Kondo-exciton X2− t should also be strongly temperature dependent.
7In the general case of arbitrary EF, the ﬁnite bandwidth model leads to the PL spectrum similar to that in ﬁg. 3b [14].
The X2− s and X3−PL lines are close to Lorentzians, with line widths of ∆due to the ﬁnite lifetime of the ﬁnal states.
It is important to emphasize that the X2− t ﬁnal state lies at lower energy and does not suﬀer from tunnel broadening such that the line shape and line width are determined by many-body eﬀects.
In summary, we have described novel excitons which can exist in self-assembled QDs when there is an interaction between a charged exciton localized on the dot and delocal- ized electrons in the wetting layer.
The charged exciton with nonzero spin is surrounded by a “cloud” (of radius ∝(kBTK)−1) of Fermi electrons.
We predict several striking man- ifestations of these novel states in the emission spectra: at low temperature, the optical lines are strongly dependent on vertical bias and their widths are determined by the Kondo temperature.
