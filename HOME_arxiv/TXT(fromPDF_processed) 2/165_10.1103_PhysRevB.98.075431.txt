The surface electronic state showed quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) dispersion curves and a nearly metallic character; the top of the hole-like band is just below the Fermi level.
The size of the Rashba parameter (αR) reached much larger value (∼5.5 eV˚A) than previously reported 1D systems..
The present result would provide a fertile playground for further studies of the exotic electronic phenomena in 1D or Q1D systems with the spin-split electronic states as well as for advanced spintronic devices.
I. INTRODUCTION Spin-polarized electronic states without ferromagnetic materials, such as the spin-split low-dimensional states due to the Rashba eﬀect1 and topological surface states2, have been studied extensively for future application to spintronics3.
Among them, one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D (Q1D) states are regarded as promising systems because of various merits such as possible downsizing of the system and highly eﬃcient suppression of backscat- tering.
Recently, spin-split (Q)1D states have attracted much attention in basic science research to realize exotic electronic phenomena such as Majorana bound states4 and spin-dependent density-wave formation5.
Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction (SOI) causes spin- split 2D (or 1D) electronic states in a low-dimensional system without space-inversion symmetry, e.g., in crystal surfaces.
Since it causes no ferromagnetic order, time- reversal symmetry remains even with spin-split states.
Assuming a parabolic dispersion with spin splitting pro- portional to the wavevector k from the Kramers degen- eracy point, the size of typical Rashba spin splitting can be expressed as ∆E = 2αRk, where the proportionality constant αR is the so-called Rashba parameter, which is often used as a scale to estimate the size of Rashba SOI.
Both theoretical and experimental eﬀort for the spin- tronic application of such Rashba-split states have been made from earlier days6.
In these days, giant Rashba spin splitting has been realized in both 2D7–11 and 3D12 systems, where αR is 3-7 eV˚A and spin-to-current con- version has been realized as the ﬁrst step toward practical spintronic application using such Rashba-split states13.
However, despite the extensive studies and fascinating theoretical prospects introduced above, a quest for (Q)1D states with giant Rashba splitting has been the challenge for surface science in this dacade, after the discovery (c) (d) [110] [001] (1 0) (1 1) (1 1/2) E  = 41 eV p E  = 42 eV p (b) Bi In As [110] [001] [110] [001] [110] (a) #1 Bi #2 #3 #4 FIG. 1.

Although some Q1D systems with Rashba splitting are known, such as Au and Pb on vici- nal Si surfaces14–17, Pt/Si(110)18, the 1D step edge of Bi thin ﬁlms19, and Pt/Ge(001)20, their Rashba parameters are at most ∼1.4 eV˚A, which is much smaller than those of the giant-Rashba counterparts in 2D and 3D systems.
Various theoretical studies to achieve a larger Rashba2 SOI have been reported so far21–28, and many param- eters have been proposed as the origin of the giant Rashba eﬀect, such as the asymmetric charge distri- bution in the proximity of surface atoms21,24, orbital- angular-momentum polarization25, and hybridization be- tween diﬀerent atomic orbitals22,27,28.
Although it is dif- ﬁcult to reach a ﬁrm conclusion from such a long debate, some clues can be obtained from these studies.
Firstly, the target electronic state should be derived from heavy elements whose nucleus potential causes a large SOI.
Sec- ondly, the state should be quite diﬀerent from nearly-free- electron (NFE) isotropic wavefunctions, since the Rashba SOIs for such NFE states are simulated to be very small by using all the theoretical models.
The Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) surface has been exten- sively studied in the 1990s as a typical ordered metal- semiconductor interface29–31.
The detailed surface atomic structure has been determined by surface X-ray diﬀraction30 to be strongly buckled zig-zag Bi chains, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).
Previous studies also reported a small density of states around the Fermi level (EF), sug- gesting metallic surface states31.
This surface is formed by heavy Bi atoms and has a Q1D atomic structure, im- plying anisotropic surface states away from NFE case.
Therefore, Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) is one of the promising surfaces to realize large Rashba-type spin splitting in a Q1D system.
However, despite these properties, no research has been reported so far about the detailed surface-band dispersion, especially focused on possible spin-split structures, of the Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) surface.
In this paper, we report on the surface states of Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) and its spin-polarized structure through angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES (SARPES), and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculation.
The sur- face state showed highly anisotropic, Q1D dispersion around EF and a nearly metallic (semiconducting) character; the top of the hole-like surface band is just below EF (∼50 meV).
The size of αR reached quite a large value (∼5.5 eV˚A).
The results provide a promising foundation for studying the spin-split Q1D electronic states as well as for developing advanced spintronic devices. II.
METHODS A clean InAs(110) surface was prepared by cleaving the side face of InAs(001) substrates (nominally undoped) in ultra-high-vacuum chambers.
As shown by the sharp and low-background low-energy electron diﬀraction (LEED) pattern in Fig. 1 (c), clean and well-deﬁned (110) sur- faces were obtained by cleavage.
Then, Bi were evapo- rated from a Knudsen cell at room temperature.
Subse- quent annealing at 563 K for 15 min produced the (2×1) surface, as indicated by the LEED pattern in Fig. 1 (d).
The sample preparation procedure is the same as that reported in previous studies29,31. ARPES measurements were performed at BL-2A MUSASHI of the Photon Factory and BL5U of UVSOR- III with photon energies ranging from 50 to 85 eV. SARPES measurements were performed at the Institute for Solid State Physics, the University of Tokyo with lin- early polarized photons by using a laser source (hν = 6.994 eV)32.
Spin-integrated ARPES data were taken at the same time with both linearly and circularly polar- ized photons by laser for the sake of comparison.
For the SARPES measurements, the photon-incident plane was (001), and the electric-ﬁeld vector of the photons was nor- mal to the incident plane (001).
The eﬀective Sherman function of the spin detector was 0.27.
The energy res- olutions and the positions of EF of both spin-integrated and spin-resolved ARPES were calibrated by the Fermi edge of a Cu block touching the sample.
The energy res- olutions of both measurements were evaluated to be ∼20 meV. DFT calculation was performed using the WIEN2k code with SOI taken into account33.
The Engel-Vosko generalized gradient approximation34 was utilized to con- struct the exchange and correlation potentials.
The sur- face was modeled by an asymmetric slab of 10 InAs lay- ers with the surface covered by (2×1) zig-zag Bi chains.
The surface atomic structure was energetically optimized down to the third In and As layers; the bottom of the slab was truncated from the bulk InAs structure and termi- nated by hydrogen atoms. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Surface electronic structure of Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) Figure 2 (a) shows the ARPES constant-energy con- tour at the binding energy of 200 ± 10 meV.
kx (ky) is deﬁned parallel to [¯110] ([001]).
The contour shows an anisotropic, Q1D shape with an open, waving contour along [001].
A waving feature in the energy contour in- dicates a small but ﬁnite 2D interaction between surface atomic chains.
Figures 2 (b) and 2 (c) show ARPES intensity plots along ¯Γ-¯X and ¯Y- ¯M, respectively.
The top of the hole bands lies slightly below EF, indicating a semiconducting character.
In general, such surface states lying around EF agree well with previous studies29,31.
The only diﬀerence is that these surface electronic states were reported to be metallic in the previous stud- ies.
However, the same (2×1) LEED patterns and sim- ilar spectral shapes (Fig. 3 (c)) to those reported in refs.29,31 suggest that the surface atomic structures are the same.
One possible reason for the discrepancy in the surface electronic states is that all the ARPES and SARPES measurements in this work were performed at low temperatures (15 to 40 K), in contrast to those at room temperature in the previous studies.
At room tem- perature, the surface accumulation layer discussed above might supply carriers (holes in this case) to the surface3 (a) (b) (c) (d) Normalized Intensity 0.8 1.2 0.4 0.0 Binding energy (eV) 0.8 1.2 0.4 0.0 Binding energy (eV) 0.3 0.6 0.3 0.6 0.0 0.0 -0.3 k (Å  ) -1 x //[110] k (Å  ) -1 x //[110] k (Å  ) -1 x //[110] k (Å  ) -1 x //[110] k (Å  ) -1 y //[001] 0.4 0.8 1.2 0.0 -0.4 0.4 0.8 1.2 0.0 -0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.4 -0.2  ✁ 80 eV 65 eV 50 eV ✂ ✄ ✂X ✂Y ☎ ✆ = 0.26 Å-1 ky //[001] = 0.00 Å-1 ky //[001] ✂ ✄ ✂X ✂Y ☎ ✆ FIG. 2.

states, making them metallic.
These results are quite en- couraging for future works, especially on spin-dependent transport phenomena via the spin-split surface states on Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1), because the diﬀerence in results be- tween the previous works and this work indicate that the carrier amount in the surface state could be tuned by some properties such as sample temperature.
Figure 2 (d) displays momentum distribution curves (MDCs) at a binding energy of 100 ± 20 meV taken in a photon energy range from 50 to 80 eV at ky = 0.00 ˚A−1.
The two peaks at kx = ±0.11˚A−1 correspond to the hole bands around ¯Γ in Fig. 2 (b).
The peak positions of hole bands do not change depending on the photon energies, indicating that the Q1D bands are surface states without any dispersion along the surface normal.
In addition, a weak intensity appears around kx = 0.00 ˚A−1 at hν > 65 eV. It would be due to the bottom of bulk conduction band with 3D dispersion, as shown below.
Figure 3 (a) shows ARPES intensity plots around ¯Γ taken with 74 eV. As indicated by the arrow, a metallic band forming a small electron pocket at ¯Γ is observed with hν = 74 eV but is absent with hν = 55 eV (see Fig. 2 (b)).
The small momentum-distribution-curve (MDC) peaks at kx = 0 ˚A−1 in Fig. 2 (d) (hν > 65 eV) cor- respond to the bottom of this small electron pocket.
In addition, a similar electron-pocket-like feature was ob- served in the ARPES intensity maps taken with a laser source (hν = 6.994 eV, Fig. 3 (b)).
In order to trace this FIG.

A fat curve is a guide to the eye of the small electron pocket.4 feature, the energy distribution curves at ¯Γ with photon energies from 50 to 80 eV are shown in Fig. 3 (c).
This metallic feature appears at hν = 59 eV at EF and shows small dispersion depending on the photon energies, as indicated by a fat line in Fig. 3 (c).
As shown there, this feature has the bottom at hν ∼70 eV (around 0.1 eV) and lies nearly at EF again at hν = 80 eV. Note that this feature is observed in wider energy range than those in Fig. 2 (d) because the momentum distribution curves in Fig. 2 (d) is taken at 100 meV below EF.
This clear dependence on the incident photon energy indicates that this small electron pocket is a 3D band; perhaps a bottom of the 3D, bulk conduction band.
Although the InAs substrates used in this work are nominally undoped, the surface preparation procedure, Bi evaporation, and subsequent annealing might form a p-type surface accu- mulation layer.
B. Spin splitting of the surface states A pair of parabolic surface bands separating with re- spect to kx = 0 ˚A−1 suggests the spin splitting due to Rashba-type SOI1.
In order to elucidate the spin texture of the surface states, the SARPES measurements is de- sirable.
Before making the spin-polarization analysis, the correspondence of the spin-integrated and spin-resolved ARPES data with each other.
Figures 4 (a-c) show spin- integrated ARPES intensity plots by using a laser source (hν = 6.994 eV).
The obtained dispersion of the paired parabolic bands below EF agrees well with those observed by higher photon energies.
With linearly polarized pho- tons, the photoelectron intensity in the vicinity of ¯Γ de- creases.
It would be owing to the photoexcitation selec- tion rule.
In Figs. 4 (d, e), the ARPES peak positions obtained by synchrotron radiation (hν = 55 eV), laser (both spin-resolved and spin-integrated ones) and DFT calculations (from Fig. 6 in the next section) are plot- ted together.
All the ARPES and SARPES peaks agree well, suggesting that they originate from the same surface bands.
Figure 5 shows the SARPES energy distribution curves taken along ¯Γ-¯X (a) and ¯Y- ¯M (b) at 40 K. The ﬁlled (open) triangles correspond to spin polarization paral- lel (anti-parallel) to [001], the in-plane orientation per- pendicular to kx.
The spin-polarized peaks in Figs. 3 (a, b) disperse downwards from kx = 0 ˚A−1.
The spin- polarization orientations invert together with the sign of the emission angles (nearly proportional to kx), and the signs of the polarizations are the same along both ¯Γ-¯X and ¯Y- ¯M. C.

Although the quantitative agreement is not perfect, as shown in Figs. 4 (d) and 4 (e), such small diﬀerence often occurs between DFT and ARPES due to various in- perfection of DFT calculation, such as thin slab thickness and a band-gap misestimation by exchange-correlation functional.
The spin-polarized character of the calculated surface states also agrees well with the SARPES results.
The spin polarization of the surface states decreases signiﬁ- cantly in the vicinity of ¯Γ and ¯Y.
This could be due to the inﬂuence of other underlying surface states (∼0.4 eV at ¯Γ and ¯Y), which also have a large contribution from the surface Bi atoms with spin orientations opposite to those of the “upper” states.

per” branch of the Rashba-split bands have been already reported in the 2D giant-Rashba systems Bi/Ag(111) and Pb/Ag(111) and discussed in detail35.
D. Giant Rashba eﬀect on Bi/InAs(110) The paired parabolic dispersion as well as the in-plane spin polarizations without breaking time-reversal sym- metry, which are perpendicular to both the surface nor- mal and the dispersion direction kx, strongly suggest Rashba-type spin splitting.
The size of the Rashba pa- rameter αR for parabolic bands can be estimated as αR = 2ER/k08, where ER and k0 are the energy and wavenum- ber diﬀerences, respectively, between the top of the hole- like band and the Kramers degenerate point (¯Γ or ¯Y in the current case, see also Fig. 7).
As shown in Figs. 7 (a) and 7 (b), the surface bands on Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) can be ﬁt well with a parabola.
From the surface-band dispersion (Figs. 7 (a, b) and Fig. 2), the Kramers de- generacy points (crossing points) along kx are 0.36 (0.14) eV at ¯Γ (¯Y) and the top of the surface bands lies at 0.07 (0.04) eV at kx = ±0.105 (0.055) ˚A−1 around ¯Γ (¯Y).
Note that these kx values can be used as k0 in the equa- tion above.
From these values obtained by ARPES, ER along ¯Γ-¯X is 0.29 eV, resulting in αR = 5.5 eV ˚A. By the same calculation, (ER, k0) = (0.10 eV, 0.055 ˚A−1) along ¯Y- ¯ M; thus, αR = 3.6 eV ˚A.

the maximum value of αR in this system (5.5 eV ˚A) is 4-5 times larger than those of other 1D or Q1D Rashba systems18,19.
Even when including 2D and 3D systems, the maximum value is greater than those of the typical giant Rashba systems such as Bi/Ag(111)8, GeTe(111)11 and BiTeI12 and is the largest among the Rashba-split states lying around EF, which is an important character to realize spin-dependent transport phenomena.
Only few surface states far below EF9,10 have larger αR values than that in the current case.
The fractional contributions of Bi atomic orbitals to the spin-split surface states are listed in Table I. The6 TABLE I.

Owing to the major contribution from 6p, the eigenfunctions of the surface states are quite diﬀerent from NFE ones, justifying the giant size of the Rashba eﬀect.
The maximum of the Rashba parameter αR is along ¯Γ-¯X (5.5 eV ˚A).
Although it is still “giant” along ¯Y- ¯M, the value (3.6 eV ˚A) is smaller than that along ¯Γ-¯X.
This could be due to the slight modiﬁcations of the surface Bi orbitals.
According to a recent theoretical study28, the size of the spin splitting is proportional to the geometric means between atomic orbitals having the same orbital characters but diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers: px, py, and pz in this case.
To trace this feature, Mab, a geometric mean of fractional contributions between Bi 6pa and 6pb (a, b = x, y, z), is calculated as shown in Ta- ble I.
Since the spin-split states of Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) have sizable fractional contributions from all 6p orbitals, all the geometric means (Mxy, Myz and Mzx in Tab. I) have ﬁnite values.
From their sum (see Table I), both Myz and Mzx are suggested to be the scale of the spin splitting; Myz(S1)/Myz(S2) ∼1.2, Mzx(S1)/Mzx(S2) ∼ 1.4, and αR(S1)/αR(S2) ∼1.5.
These are the geomet- ric means between in-plane and out-of-plane 6p orbitals.
Such hybridizations between in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals have also been observed in other giant Rashba systems9,10,22,24,26,28,35.
In addition, it should be noted that the nonequivalence between ¯Γ and ¯Y originates from the 2D, inter-Bi-chain interaction, which suggests that external-ﬁeld application normal to the 1D chain could tune the size of the 1D Rashba eﬀect.
The giant spin splitting in the Q1D surface state dis- covered here is expected to be a promising template for future spintronic devices3.
For example, the eﬃciency of spin-to-charge conversion by the inverse Edelstein ef- fect (IEE), which is scaled by λIEE, is estimated to be ∼4 nm for this state, assuming the momentum relax- ation time of 5 fs: this relaxation time is nearly an aver- age of known surface-Rsahba systems13,36,37.
This λIEE value is an order of magnitude larger than those of 2D Rashba systems13,36 and even larger than those of topo- logical insulators37, implying that sizable spin-dependent transport in 1D should be observed on Bi/InAs(110).
In addition, for such applications, a method to control sur- face carriers is desirable.
Such control would be achieved easily for this surface state because some previous stud- ies actually reported metallic surface states31.
For tun- ing the surface carrier, carrier accumulation depending on the substrate temperature as discussed in Section II as well as surface alloying with smaller-valence elements such as Pb would be applicable.
In addition to industrial applications, the ﬁne tuning of the surface Q1D state with spin splitting is expected to cause exotic electronic phenomena that would be of interest in basic science studies, such as studies on spin-dependent density-wave formation5 and to realize Majorana bound states4. IV.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In summary, we have investigated the quasi-one- dimensional (Q1D) surface states on the Bi/InAs(110)- (2×1) surface and its spin-polarized structure by angle- resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), spin- resolved ARPES, and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculation.
The surface state showed a nearly metallic character, lying just below the Fermi level (EF) with gi- ant Rashba spin splitting whose the Rashba parameter αR reached ∼5.5 eV˚A. This value of the Rashba param- eter is 4-5 times larger than that of other 1D or Q1D Rashba systems and is the largest value among all the experimentally realized Rashba-split systems around EF.
The present results are expected to provide a promising foundation for further studies of the exotic electronic phe- nomena in 1D or Q1D systems with spin-split electronic states as well as for the development of advanced spin- tronic devices.

The SARPES ex- periment in this work was carried out by joint research in ISSP, the University of Tokyo.
This work was also sup- ported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grants Nos. JP26887024 and JP17K18757).7 1.0 0.5 0.0 Binding energy (eV) 1.0 0.5 2.0 1.5 0.0 Binding energy (eV) k (Å  ) -1 y 0.4 0.8 -0.8 -0.4 0.0 (a) (b)  ✁  ✁1×1  ✁  Y  Y  ✁  Y  Y ✂✄ ☎ ✆✝ ✞✟ ✂✄ ☎ ✆✝ ✞✟  Y1×1  Y1×1 FIG. 8.
ARPES intensity plots at 15 K (hν = 80 eV) with lin- early polarized photons, taken from (a) Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) and (b) as-cleaved pristine InAs(110) surface.
Energy resolu- tion of these plots were 40 meV. Appendix A: Surface band dispersion and Rashba spin splitting normal to the zig-zag Bi chain Figure 8 (a) shows an ARPES intensity plot along ¯Γ-¯Y, the surface-band dispersion perpendicular to the surface zig-zag Bi chain.
It shows a clear periodicity accord- ing to the (2×1) surface Brillouin zone.
This dispersion between ¯Γ and ¯Y is derived from ﬁnite 2D interaction across the surface Bi chain.
The overall feature of this dispersion agrees well with the DFT calculation shown in Fig. 6.
The Rashba splitting of the surface band is not resolved along this direction, because the splitting is smaller than the peak width of the ARPES energy distri- bution curves (∼100 meV).
The small size of the Rashba splitting might have resulted from the strong suppression of splitting due to the surface mirror plane along ¯Γ-¯Y38.
Appendix B: Comparison with a pristine InAs(110) surface To reveal the role of the (2×1)-Bi surface atomic struc- ture to the surface electronic states, the band dispersison along ¯Γ-¯Y from the as-cleaved, pristine (110) surface of InAs is shown in Fig. 8 (b).
It shows only a bulk hole- like bands without any feature below 0.5 eV, indicating that all the electronic structure near EF observed in this work come from the (2×1)-Bi surface atomic structure.
