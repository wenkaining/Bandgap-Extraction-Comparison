Abstract : Reflection–refraction properties of photonic barriers, formed by dielectric gradient  nanofilms, for inclined incidence of both S- and P-polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves are  examined by means of exactly solvable models.
We present generalized Fresnel formulae,  describing the influence of the non-local dispersion on reflectance and transmittance of  single- and double-layer gradient photonic barriers for S- and P- waves and arbitrary angles of  incidence.
The non-local dispersion of such layers, arising due to a concave spatial profile of  dielectric susceptibility across the plane film, is shown to result in a peculiar heterogeneity –  induced optical anisotropy, providing the propagation of S(P) waves in tunneling (travelling)  regimes.
The  results obtained indicate the possibility of narrow–band non–attenuated  tunneling (complete transmittance) of oblique S- waves through such heterogeneous barriers,  and the existence of spectral areas characterized by strong reflection of P-waves and deep  contrast between transmitted S– and P-waves.
The scalability of obtained exact analytical  solutions of Maxwell equations into the different spectral ranges is discussed and the  application potential of these phenomena for miniaturized polarizers and filters  is  demonstrated.       PACS.
42.25.Bs2   1.  INTRODUCTION.
Tunneling is a basic wave phenomenon with many interesting applications.
The concept of  tunneling was pioneered by Gamow for particles in quantum mechanics as long ago as in  1928 [1].
Later on this quantum aproach, involving the time-independent Schrodinger  equation, and the wave approach, involving the Helmholtz monochromatic wave equation,  were considered to be formally equivalent.
The advent of lasers has attracted attention on the  effects of tunneling of EM waves through classical barriers in a series of optoelectronic  problems, such as, e.g., the evanescent modes in dielectric waveguides [2] and liquid crystals [3], Goos–Hanchen effect for curvilinear interfaces [4-6].
Experiments in the microwave  range with “undersized” waveguide [7], and Goos-Hanchen spatial shift of a narrow beam,  passing through paraffine double prisms [8], have demonstrated the possibilities of  observation of tunneling effects, which proved not to be easy to reproduce at quantum scales.
Side by side with the numerous applications of the tunneling concept in optoelectronics, solid  state and microwave physics [9], this concept contains an intriguing theoretical challenge,  connected with the idea of superluminal light tunneling through the photonic barrier (Hartman  paradox, [10], [11]).
The theoretical background of the aforesaid researches is based on the electromagnetics of  heterogeneous media [12].
Herein some important features of evanescent waves are examined  usually in the framework of a simple model of rectangular opaque barrier [13] or layered  structure, formed by step-like variations of refractive indices [14].
Another field for wave  tunneling phenomena is connected with the gradient optics of thin films: the non – local  dispersion, arising due to continuous spatial variations of dielectric susceptibility was shown  recently to provide a rich variety of tunneling phenomena even in a material with negligible3 natural local dispersion [15].
These phenomena can be examined by means of exact analytical  solutions of Maxwell equations for media with spatially distributed dielectric susceptibility     ( )z ε  =  ( )z U n 2 2 0  .
(1)     Here n0 is the value of the host dielectric refractive index, the dimensionless function U(z)  describes the coordinate dependence of the dielectric susceptibility.
This heterogeneity can  result in the formation of a cut-off frequency Ω , dependent upon the gradient and curvature  of the ( )z ε  profile [15]; thus, for heterogeneous nanofilms with a thickness of about 100 nm  and depth of modulation of refractive index about 25% the cut-off frequencies Ω , separating  the evanescent and travelling modes, belong to the near IR or visible spectral ranges.
Controlled variety of reflection – refraction properties of the layer, produced by different  profiles U(z), opens the possibilities of creation of media with optical properties unattainable  in natural materials.
The decisive role of the heterogeneity-induced dispersion was examined in [15] for the case  of normal incidence, when the wave polarization effects are vanishing; however, the model  U(z) used in [15] does not support analytical solutions of the wave equation for an inclined  incidence of polarized waves.
Unlike Ref. 15, this paper is devoted to the peculiar effects in  reflectivity and transmittivity of both S- and P- polarized waves, incidenting under an  arbitrary angle on an heterogeneous dielectric layer, characterized by some profile U(z).
The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we present a model of non-monotonic  concave profile U(z), suitable for both S- and P-waves in the gradient medium and  demonstrate the effects of heterogeneity – induced optical anisotropy.
Exact analytical  solutions of the wave equations obtained for such U(z), revealing the polarization-dependent  propagation and tunneling regimes for both one and two gradient layers, are examined in  Section 3.
In section 4 we use these solutions for analysis of narrow – band reflectionless4 tunneling of S-waves, strong reflection of P-waves, deep contrast between transmitted S- and  P- waves and some phase effects, associated with the aforesaid phenomena.
The conclusions  are summarized in Section 5. 2.
PROPAGATION AND TUNNELING OF S- AND P–POLARIZED WAVES IN  GRADIENT MEDIA (EXACTLY SOLVABLE MODEL).
Unlike in the case of the normal incidence case, here the waves have a different polarization  structure and are described by different equations.
Denoting the normal to the layer as z-axis  and choosing the projection of the wave vector on the layer’s interface as y-axis, one can  describe the polarization structure of an S-wave by means of its electric component Ex and  magnetic components Hy and Hz.
The layer is assumed to be lossless and non-magnetic, and  one can write the Maxwell equations linking these components:     t H c z E y x ∂ ∂ − = ∂ ∂ 1  ; t H c y E z x ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ 1  ;   ( ) t E c z z H y H x y z ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ − ∂ ∂ ε  ;       (2)     ( ) 0 = E div ε  ;  ( ) 0 = H div  .
(3)     Components of P-wave (Hx, Ey and Ez) are also linked by Eq. (3); but the Eqs.
(2) have to be  replaced by:     ( ) t E c z z H y x ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ ε ;   ( ) t E c z y H z x ∂ ∂ − = ∂ ∂ ε  ; t H c z E y E x y z ∂ ∂ − = ∂ ∂ − ∂ ∂ 1  .
(4)5  The effects of heterogeneity-induced dispersion for inclined incidence can be found from the  set (2) – (4) by means of  exactly solvable models of ( )z ε  given by Eq. (1), suitable for both  S- and P- polarizations.
The well known Rayleigh profile U(z) = (1 + z/L)-1 , dating back to  1880 , and exponential profile U(z) = exp( z/L) provides exact solutions of the set (2) –(4) for  monotonic variations of U(z) [12]; however, these models are not suitable for description of  smoothly varying concave photonic barriers, that we plan to discuss.
Thus, the reflection– refraction problem for the set of equations (2)-(4) is considered below from the very  beginning.
It is worthwhile to express the field components in Maxwell equations by means  of the following auxiliary, polarization-dependent functions  s Ψ  and  p Ψ :    S – polarization: dt d c E s x Ψ − = 1  ; dz d H s y Ψ =  ;   dy d H s z Ψ − =  ;       (5)     P – polarization: dt d c H p x Ψ = 1  ;   ( ) dz d z E p y Ψ = ε 1  ;   ( ) dy d z E p z Ψ − = ε 1  .
(6)     Using such representations one can reduce the system (2) – (4) to two equations, governing S- and P-waves respectively.
Omitting for simplicity the factor exp[i( t y ky ω − )], these equations  can be written as:     0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 = Ψ ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − + ∂ Ψ ∂ s y s k c U n z ω  ,  θ ω sin c ky =  ,           (7)     z dz dU U k c U n z p p y p ∂ Ψ ∂ = Ψ ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − + ∂ Ψ ∂ 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 ω   .
(8)6 By introducing the new variable η  and new functions  sf  and  pf      ( ) ∫ = z dz z U 0 1 1 η ;  ( )z U f s s Ψ =  ;   ( )z U f p p Ψ =  ;           (9)     one can present eqs.
(7) – (8) for S- and P – waves in the forms:     0 4 2 2 2 2 2 = ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + − Λ + U U U U f d f d s s η ηη η                  (10)    0 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 = ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − + Λ + U U U U f d f d p p η ηη η  ,               (11)     where  2 2 2 2 0 2 U k c n y − = Λ ω  ;   η η d dU U =  ;   2 2 η ηη d U d U =  . Eqs.
(10) – (11) are valid for  arbitrary profiles of photonic barriers U(z) and all angles of incidence θ , including in  particular, the two well – known exactly solvable models mentioned above (Rayleigh and  exponential profiles).
The fact that some polarization effects will depend on the barrier profile  is clear even without solution of these equations.
In the case of the widely used Rayleigh  profile UR , which can be rewritten in η -space by means of (9) as UR(η ) = exp(- η /L),  therefore both equations (10) and (11) coincide: ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − − ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + L n c n f d f d cr p s p s η θ ω ω ω η 2 exp sin 1 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 , 2 , 2  = 0.
(12)7 Eq. (12) shows that, due to heterogeneity-induced dispersion, characterized by a cut-off  frequency  L n c cr 0 2 = ω , the tunneling regimes arise in the Rayleigh barrier for both S- and P-  waves simultaneously.
In the case of the exponential profile, rewritten in  − η space as  L U / 1 η − = , no heterogeneity -induced cut-off frequency can be defined from eqs. (10)-(11).
In contrast to these traditionally used asymmetrical profiles, we consider here the exactly  solvable symmetrical concave barrier U(z), formed inside the dielectric film (thickness d) by  variation of U from the value U = 1 in the centre of barrier (z = 0) up to the values Um at the  interfaces z = ± d/2 (Fig. 1):    ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = L z U cos 1 ;   m Um 1 =  ;   ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = L d m 2 cos  .
(13)     Note that this model is characterized by one free parameter (the length-scale L), however it  can be used to study many features associated with  this type of potential as we will show in  Section 4.
In fact, it represents a particular case of a more general potential with two  adjustable parameters which, however, leads to much more cumbersome calculations and thus  is not developed here.
Substitution of (13) into (9) brings the variable η  and profile U(η ) :     ( ) ( )⎥⎦ ⎤ ⎢⎣ ⎡ − + = L z tg L z tg L 2 / 1 2 / 1 ln η  ;   ξ ch L z U = ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = cos 1 ;   L η ξ = . (14)     Using eq.
(14) one can rewrite eqs.
(10)-(11) for S- and P-waves inside the barrier given by  eq.
(13) into the similar form:8 0 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 = ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − + ξ ξ ch T q f d f d p s p s p s                  (15)     ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ Ω − ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = 2 2 2 0 2 1 ω ω c L n q  ;                  (16)     ( ) 4 1 2 + = L k T y s  ;   ( ) 4 3 2 − = L k T y p  ,               (17)     where Ω  is a characteristic frequency, determined by the parameters of concave barrier (13):     ( ) m Arc d n c L n c cos 2 0 0 = = Ω  .
(18) The sign of parameter q2 given by eq.(16) changes in  Ω = ω .
Let us consider here the low  frequency spectral range  Ω < ω , q2 < 0.
In this range the expression in brackets in eq.(15) for  S-wave is always negative, and thus low frequency S-wave, incidenting on the barrier given  by eq.(13) under an arbitrary angle θ , is traversing this barrier as an evanescent wave.
On the contrary, the same expression in Eq. (15) for a P-wave, for realistic values of the  modulation of the refractive index (13) in the layer (Um = m-1 ≤ 1.3 – 1.4) remains positive  and provides the travelling mode regime for P-wave.
Thus, unlike the homogeneous rectangular barrier, where the tunneling of EM waves is  determined by a condition common to both S- and P-polarizations, the tunneling through the  concave barrier given by eq.(13) proves to be polarization – dependent.
This heterogeneity –  induced anisotropy can result in a significant difference in reflectivity and transmittivity of  such barrier for S- and P-waves, their frequencies and angles of incidence on the film being  equal.
This difference is illustrated below by means of exactly solvable model (13).9   3. HETEROGENEITY–INDUCED OPTICAL ANISOTROPY OF TRANSPARENT  LAYERS.
To simplify the analysis of the transmission of a concave photonic barrier for an EM wave  with inclined incidence, let us first consider one layer without substrate embedded in free  space - see Fig. 1.
We introduce the dimensionless quantities     ω Ω = u  > 1 ;   2 1 − − = u N < 1 .
(19) By transforming eq.(15) by means of new variable ν and new function W       2 1 ξ th v − =  ,  ( ) p s N p s W ch f , 2 , ξ =                  (20)     one obtains for this function the hypergeometric equation     ( ) ( ) [ ] 0 1 1 2 2 = − + + − + − W dv dW v dv W d v v αβ β α γ ;  2 1 N − = γ  .
(21) Although eq.(21) is valid for both polarizations, the values of parameters α  and β  have to be  specified for each wave; definition γ  (21) is valid for both waves.
Let us start the analysis  from S- wave; in this case     ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ − ± − = 0 2 1 sin 1 2 1 , n N i N s s θ β α .
(22)10   Since  γ β α 2 1 = + + s s , two linearly-independent solutions of eq.(21) are given by the  hypergeometric functions F( v s s , , , γ β α ) and F( v s s − 1, , , γ β α ), denoted below for  compactness as F(ν) and F(1-ν); moreover, due to condition  ( ) 0 Re < − + γ β α s s  the series,  presenting these functions, are converging absolutely [16].
The general solution of eq.(21) is     W = F(ν) + Qs F(1-ν) .
(23)     Here F(ν) and F(1-ν) can be considered as forward and backward waves (meaning more  exactly in a tunneling case, evanescent and antievanescent waves), meanwhile the factor Qs is  associated with the contribution of backward wave to the complete field.
By using the  variables defined in Eqs.
(9) and (19) and expressing the factor chξ  in terms of cos(z/L)  according to eq.(14) one can present the generating function  s Ψ  in a form:       = Ψs ( ) [ ] W L z N 2 1 cos −  .
(24)      Substitution of eq.(24) into eq.(5) yields the explicit expressions for components of S-wave  inside the medium:     c A i Ex ω = s Ψ ;   s e z A ik H Ψ − =  ;   (25)   ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) ( ) ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ ⎭⎬⎫ + − − = + dv dW L z W L z N L z L A H N y 2 2 1 cos sin 1 cos 2 ,11 where A is the wave’s complex amplitude.
To find the reflection coefficient for S-wave Rs  one has to use the continuity conditions on the film interfaces  2 d z ± = .
It follows from (14),  that     ( ) L z th sin = ξ  ;   ( ) 2 sin 1 L z v − =  ;   ( ) 2 sin 1 1 L z v + = −  .
(26)    Let us consider the wave incidenting on the interface z = -d/2.
By introducing the variables  2 ,1v      2 1 1 2 s v v d z + = = − =  ; ( ) 2 1 1 2 2 s v v d z − = = − + =  ;  2 1 m s − =  ;   (27)   ( ) 2 ,1 2 ,1 v F F =  ;  1 1 v dv dF F = ′ ;  2 2 v dv dF F = ′     one can derive the expression for Rs from the continuity conditions on this plane     Rs =  ( ) ( ) 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 M i Q M F i F i M Q F i M s s s s s s − + − + + + ζ ζ ζ ζ                 (28)     ( ) 2 ,1 2 2 ,1 2 ,1 1 F m F N s M ′ ± − =    0 2 1 cos n N m s − = θ ζ   .
(29) The factor Qs can be determined from the continuity conditions on the opposite interface z =  d/2 :12 ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − − − = 1 1 2 2 F i M F i M Qs ζ ζ .
(30)    Substituting Qs given by eq.(30) into eq.(28) one obtains the complex reflection coefficient Rs     s s s B A R =  ;  ( ) 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 F F M M A s s − + − = ζ ;  2 1 iB B Bs + =  ;                           (31)    ( ) 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 F F M M B s − + − = ζ  ;  ( ) M F M F B s 2 1 1 2 2 − = ζ .
Now we rewrite the complex reflection coefficient Rs into the form Rs = |Rs|exp(i sr φ )     2 2 2 1 B B A R s s + =  ;  ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − = 1 2 B B arctg sr φ  .
(32)      To find the transmission function Ts one has to express the amplitude of refracted wave A  from (25) via the amplitude of incidenting wave E0 and reflection coefficient Rs     ( ) ( ) 2 1 0 1 F Q F R c iE A s s + + − = ω                      (33) By using the eq.(33) one can write the field E at the interface z = d/2 by means of a complex  transmission function Ts:    sT E E 0 =  ;   ( ) st s s i T T φ exp =  ;   2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 B B M F M F T s s + − = ζ ;   ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = 2 1 B B arctg st φ  .
(34)13  The reflection coefficient for P-wave Rp can be calculated in the same way.
The generating  function  p Ψ  (6) is expressed via the relevant solution of the eq.(21), similar to eq.(23):     ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) [ ] ν γ β α ν γ β α − + = Ψ + − 1, , , , , , / cos 2 1 p p p p p N p F Q F L z ;        ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − − − = 3 3 4 4 F i M F i M Q p p p ζ ζ  ;                  (35)    m N n p 2 0 1 cos − = θ ζ  ;     Forward and backward(propagating) waves  are described through the eq.(35) by the  hypergeometric functions F with parameters     ( ) ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ − − ± − = 2 0 2 2 sin 1 4 1 2 1 , n N N p p θ β α  ;   2 1 N − = γ  ;          (36)     Substitution of generating function given by eq.(35) into eq.(6) brings the components of the  P-wave.
Using the continuity conditions, one can present the reflection coefficient Rp in a  form, analogous to Rs (32) :     ( ) ( ) 4 4 3 3 4 4 3 3 M F i Q M F i F i M Q F i M R p p p p p p p − + − + + + = ε ε ε ε  ;    ( ) pr p p i R R φ exp =    2 4 2 3 B B A R p p + =  ;   ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − = 3 4 B B arctg pr φ  ;14   ( ) 2 4 2 3 2 2 4 2 3 F F M M A p p − + − = ζ  ;                 (37)      ( ) 2 4 2 3 2 2 3 2 4 3 F F M M B p − + − = ζ  ;   ( ) 4 4 3 3 4 2 M F M F B p − = ζ  ;    ( ) ' 4 ,3 2 4 ,3 4 ,3 1 F m F N s M ± + = ;   ( ) 2 ,1 , , , 4 ,3 v v p p dv v dF F = = ′ γ β α  .
The transmission function for P-wave Tp can be found by analogy with eqs.(33) – (34) in the  form     ( ) pt p p i T T φ exp =  ;   2 4 23 3 3 4 4 3 2 B B M F M F T p p + − = ζ ;   ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = 4 3 B B arctg pt φ  ;       (38) Thus, we found the expressions for reflection coefficients Rs,p and transmission functions Ts,p,  valid for an arbitrary angle of incidence θ .
The quantities |Rs,p| and |Ts,p| are linked by the  energy conservation law:       |Ts,p|2 = 1 - |Rs,p|2 .
(39) It is necessary to emphasize that in the normal incidence case ( 0 = θ ) the difference between  S- and P- polarized waves is vanishing, and, thus, the moduli of reflection and transmission  coefficients have to be equal; this equality, which is not obvious from the formulae for |Rs|  (32) and |Rp| (37), is demonstrated analytically in the Appendix.
The effects of heterogeneity-induced dispersion on the amplitude-phase structure of  transmitted radiation manifest themselves, first of all, by the angular dependence of the15 transmittance of gradient layers for S– and P–polarized waves.
These transmittances, |Ts|2 and  |Tp|2, calculated by eqs.(34) and (38) respectively, are depicted on Fig. 2.
In the case of  inclined incidence |Tp|2, exceeding |Ts|2, can even reach the value |Tp|2=1, illustrating the  Brewster effect for a gradient layer; however, the angle θ , related to this reflectionless  regime, differs from the Brewster angle  B θ  for an homogeneous layer ( 0n tg B = θ ).
In Fig. 2 we present the angular dependence of transmittances of an heterogeneous layer for  S- and P- waves for some given value of dimensionless parameter γ  given by eq.(21),  defined for any normalized frequency u =  ω Ω .
Considering the transmittance regime,  related to some values γ , m, θ  and n0 and using the characteristic frequency Ω  given by  eq.(18), one can choose the thickness of the layer d, providing the formation of such regime  for any given polarization and wavelength λ  by means of expression, following from  eqs.(21) and (18):     ( ) ( ) 0 2 2 cos 1 4 1 n m Arc d π γ λ − − =  .
(40) Thus, for the set of parameters related to Fig. 2 and  = λ 1.55 µm eq.
(40) defines the thickness  of the layer d = 45 nm; herein Fig. 2 remains valid for any values of d and λ , linked by  relation (40) with m = 0.75, n0 = 3.4 and  γ  = 0.75 .
To compare these results with the transmittance of an homogeneous layer (m = 1) with the  same values of d and n0, one can examine the simple case of normal incidence.
The reflection  coefficient R for this geometry is known [19] to be given by     ( ) ( ) 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 1 in tg n tg n R + + − = δ δ ;   λ π δ d n0 2 =  .
(41)16 Calculation of R for the abovementioned values of d, n0 and λ  and substitution of this R into  the conservation law (39) yields the transmittance of the homogeneous layer for normal  incidence |T0|2 = 0.33, meanwhile the transmission coefficient for the heterogeneous layer  shown in Fig. 2, for normal incidence is |T|2 = 0.46.
Thus, the transmittance of a gradient layer  |T|2 can exceed the transmittance of an homogeneous film |T0|2 with the same values of d and  n0 by 40%.
The spectral properties of transmittance for S- and P- waves are presented in Figs. 3-4 and 6  in the (|T|2 - γ ) plane, providing a uniform scale on horizontal axis of graphs.
Herein the  comparison of Figs. 3a – 3b, drawn for one gradient layer, shows, that the increase of depth of  modulation of refractive index m can result in drastic changes of transmittance – reflection  spectra of gradient film for S-waves.
A narrow asymmetrical peak of reflectionless tunneling  for S-waves arises near by the point u = 1,  1 = γ .
This peak is contiguous with a narrow area  of high dispersion of transmittance coefficient with almost vertical tangent to the graph  |Ts(γ )|2.
The transmittance |Tp|2 in this range remains almost constant, approximately 87 %.
When the angle of incidence is decreased the existence of the peak is unaffected while  transmittance |Tp|2 tends to 100%(Fig. 3c).
On the contrary, in the low frequency spectral range, close to the point γ  = 0.5 (Fig.3c), the  reflection of S- waves is almost unvariable, close to 100%, meanwhile the transmittance of P-  waves tends to zero; herein the frequency dispersion of |Tp|2 in this range is strong.
This high  contrast between the transmittance of gradient layers for S- and P-waves may be interesting  for polarizing systems, operating under the large angles of incidence.
These layers may be  rather thin: thus, e.g., a polarizing screen, providing for transmitted waves the ratio |Tp|2/|Ts|2 <  0.05, is characterized, under the conditions of Fig. 3c (u = 3.2), by the ratio  025 .0 = λ d   (eq.40).
Such miniaturized scales d are a remarkable feature of the anisotropic gradient  nanolayers in question.17 4.
NARROW-BAND REFLECTIONLESS TUNNELING OF S –WAVES.
While discussing the transmittance peaks for S-waves |Ts|2 = 1 in the spectral range u ≤ 1  (Fig. 3b – 3c), one has to emphasize that these peaks arise in the regime of reflectionless  tunneling of wave (Rs = 0) through the gradient layer.
Cancellation of the reflected wave  results from the interference of the wave reflected on the interface z = -d/2, with the  transmitted part of backward antievanescent wave.
This cancellation arises only for the  concave photonic barrier: in the case of a square barrier with constant refractive index such  cancellation proves to be impossible [17].
Proceeding in a similar fashion, we can find the transmittance of a pair of gradient layers for  S- and P – polarized waves, characterized by coefficients |T2s|2 and |T2p|2.
To calculate these  coefficients let us examine the set of two parallel adjacent layers, shown in Fig. 1.
Herein the  continuity conditions on the interfaces z = -d/2 and z = 3d/2 remain unchanged.
Considering  first the S-wave one can see, that formulae for Rs (28) and Qs (30) relating to these conditions  for S-wave, are also valid for the set of two layers.
Recalling these conditions for the  intermediate boundary z = d/2, we can find, after some tedious algebra, the value Q, related to  this boundary      ( ) ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ + + + + − = 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 F M F M M F Q F M Q F M M F Q s s  .
(42) Here the values M1,2 and Qs are defined in eqs.(29) – (30).
Substitution of eq.(42) into eq(28)  yields the complex reflection coefficient R2s for the set of two layers: s s s s iJ K G R + = 2      Gs = (F1M1 – F2M2)[M1 2 – M2 2 + 2 s ζ (F1 2 – F2 2 )] ;18                         (43) Ks = ( F1M1 – F2M2)[ M2 2 – M1 2 + 2 s ζ (F1 2 – F2 2 )] ;    Js =  s ζ [ (F1 2 – F2 2)(M1 2 – M2 2) +(F1M1 – F2M2)2] .
The reflection coefficient of the same pair for P-wave R2p can be determined by analogy with  eq.(43) by means of replacement of indices s→ p in the relevant terms in eqs.(42) – (43), e.g.,  p s G G → , and the following transpositions:     p p p p iJ K G R + = 2 ;   (44)  4 ,3 2 ,1 F F →  ;  4 ,3 2 ,1 M M → ;  p s ζ ζ → ;      In the case of normal incidence one again obtains |R2s|2 = |R2p|2 - see Appendix.
The transmission coefficients |T2s|2 and |T2p|2 for the pair of layers, found by means of the  substitution of eq.(43) and eq.(44) into eq.(39), are presented on Fig. 4.
The comparison of  Figs. 4a and 4b shows the strengthening of optical anisotropy of gradient films due to increase  of their heterogeneity: The decrease of m from m = 0.95 (Fig.4a) to m= 0.86 (Fig. 4b) results  again in the formation of reflectionless tunneling (non-attenuated transmittance) regimes for  S-waves as well as the huge dispersion of |T2s|2 and slowly varying high transmittance of P-  waves near by the point u = 1.
However, in this geometry the range of reflectionless tunneling  contains two closely located peaks with the very narrow spectral width (Fig. 5).
Thus, such  pair of films can be considered as a model of miniaturized frequency filter for S-waves.
The  effects of non-attenuated tunneling analogous to superlensing phenomenon in which  evanescent waves contribute to the perfect image of the objects by means of negative19 refractive index medium[18], represent an alternative and new concept of energy transfer that  employs evanescent waves and may be useful in design of subwavelength devices.
In Fig. 6 we present the phase shifts of transmitted waves φ  .
The phase times tph = ω φ ∂ ∂  are  positive for S-wave in all the spectral range u < 1, meanwhile for P-wave the values tph are  positive in a broad spectral interval 0.55 < γ  < 1 and negative in a narrow spectral interval  0.52 < γ  < 0.55.
In the former interval the phase shift of P- waves, passing through the pair of  films, can reach the values, close to  .2 π ±     Comparison of phases of reflected (32) and transmitted (34) S- waves leads to the relation  0 1 = + st srtg tg φ φ .
A similar relation can be found from eqs.(37) – (38) for P-waves also.
Thus, these phases are linked:   2 π φ φ φ φ ± = − = − pt pr st sr                    (45)   Formulae (43)-(44) show that the correlation (45), derived for one layer, remains valid for a  pair of layers.
This property can be used for determination of the phase of tunneling wave, if  its detection is impeded due to strong attenuation in an opaque barrier [19].
Until now our analysis was restricted by the model of heterogeneous film without substrate.
To examine the applicability of obtained results to the real case of a layer supported by  substrate, let us consider the layer deposited on an homogeneous lossless layer of thickness D  and with refractive index nD – see Fig.1 .
By presenting the generating function for, e.g., S- wave, inside the homogeneous layer in a form     ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) [ ] t y k i z ik Q z ik y D D ω ψ − − + = ⊥ ⊥ exp exp exp  ;   (46)  r c k ω = ⊥ ;  θ 2 2 sin − = D n r  ,20 and by using the continuity conditions on the interface between this layer and air (z = d + D),  one can find the parameter QD that enters eq.(46) in the form:     ( ) D ik r r QD ⊥ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + − − = 2 exp cos cos θ θ .
(47) The continuity conditions on the interface between the layer and heterogeneous film can be  written by means of eqs.(25)–(27) ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + − = + + D D s s Q Q c Lrm i F Q F M Q M 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ω  .
(48) The expression in brackets in (48) can be rewritten by means of eq.(47) in the form     θ ζ θ cos cos 1 1 i r tg ri Q Q D D − − = + −  ;   c rD ω ζ = ;             (49) If the thickness D is choosen so, that     π θ ω l c n D D = − 2 2 sin ;   ...
3;2;1 = l                (50)     where the right side of eq.(48) is reduced to  s iζ  (29), and the value Qs, defined from (48), as  well as the reflection coefficient Rs coincide with the values (30) and (32), calculated in the  absense of substrate.
The same condition (50) can be also found for P-wave.
Thus, the  condition (50) being fulfilled, this layer makes no influence on the reflection-refraction  properties of gradient films discussed.21  When the gradient layer is deposited on a  homogeneous transparent substrate with refractive  index n and thickness D, the expressions for reflection coefficients Rs and Rp   obtained above  can be generalized by means of the relevant continuity conditions on the interface z = d/2.
In  particular, in a case, when D >>ct, where t is the duration of incident wave pulse (thick  substrate) – so that no interference effects can occur between the incident and the far-interface  reflected pulse – or when the reflection is eliminated by use of an anti-reflection coating or by  using a wedged substrate, these generalized expressions for a single layer read as:     1 1 s s s B A R =  ;    ( ) ( )( ) 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 M F M F i F F M M A s s s − − + − + − = ζ ζ ζ ζ  ;    ( ) ( )( ) 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 M F M F i F F M M B s s s − + + − + − = ζ ζ ζ ζ  ;   θ ζ ζ cos 1 r s =  ;    (51)     θ 2 2 sin − = n r  .
The value Rp can be obtained from this Rs by applying the transpositions:      As1→Ap1; Bs1→Bp1 ; F1,2 → F3,4 ; M1,2 → M3,4 ;  p s ζ ζ →  ;  θ ζ ζ cos 1 r p → .
In a case when n = 1 (air) and r = sinθ , these formulae reduce to eqs.(31) and (37) ,  respectively.
The condition of reflectionless tunneling R1s = 0 results in two equations,  nullifying the real and imaginary parts of numerator As1.
Combining the equations Re[As1] =   0 and Im [As1)] = 0, one obtains the expression r:     ( ) 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 cos F F M M r s − − = ζ θ  .
(52) The right side of eq.(52) is known, therefore r =  θ 2 2 sin − n  and, finally, one obtains the  value of the refractive index of substrate n, that provides such non–attenuated tunneling.
Then  the values Ts and Tp can be calculated using eq. (39).
An example of transmittance through a  gradient photonic barrier deposited on a thick substrate with refractive index n for S and P22 wave, calculated according to eq.(52), is depicted in Fig. 7 and denoted by s and p,  respectively.
We find that the presence of the thick substrate affects the transmittance for S  wave (denoted by S0 in Fig. 7) and results in broadening of the peak of the transmittance and  an increase of its minimum in comparison with the transmittance without the substrate,  however, the main tendencies in spectrum remain unchanged, while the change of the  transmittance for P wave is negligible. 5.  CONCLUSIONS.
In conclusion, we have considered the transmittance of gradient photonic barriers, formed by  thin dielectric layers with concave profiles of refractive index, for arbitrarily polarized EM  waves, incidenting on these barriers under arbitrary angles..
The non–local dispersion,  determined by the shape of photonic barriers, is shown to provide a peculiar optical  anisotropy, stipulating the propagation of P (S)–polarized waves in travelling (tunneling)  regime.
The amplitude-phase structure of reflected and transmitted S- and P–polarized waves  is found in the framework of exactly solvable model of gradient barriers, and the generalized  Fresnel formulae for reflectance and transmittance of single layer and double-layer concave  photonic barriers are presented.
The effect of narrow – band reflectionless tunneling (100 %  transmittance) of S–wave is demonstrated.
These solutions, obtained without any assumptions  regarding the smallness or slowness of variations of EM fields or media, can be used for  applicability check of some approximations, found by transfer matrix approach [20] or  numerical solutions for EM fields in spatially varying media [21].
The examples of using of  these results in the gradient optics of nanolayers may become useful for design of  miniaturized optoelectronic devices with dimensions much smaller than the wavelength,  operating with the oblique incidence of EM waves, such as polarizers, phase shifters,  frequency-selective interfaces and large incidence angles filters.
The scalability of obtained23 exact analytical solutions to the different spectral ranges seems to be perspective for creation  of materials with the electromagnetic properties, unattainable in the natural media. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
