ǀǀ Current address: Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City,  UT 84112, USA3 Organic spintronic devices have been appealing because of the long spin life time of the  charge carriers in the organic materials and their low cost, flexibility and chemical  diversity.
In previous studies, the control of resistance of organic spin valves is generally  achieved by the alignment of the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic  electrodes, generating magnetoresistance.1 Here we employ a new knob to tune the  resistance of organic spin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between  the ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer.
We show that the resistance can be  controlled by not only the spin alignment of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, but also  by the electric polarization of the interfacial ferroelectric layer: the MR of the spin  valve depends strongly on the history of the bias voltage which is correlated with the  polarization of the ferroelectric layer; the MR even changes sign when the electric  polarization of the ferroelectric layer is reversed.
This new tunability can be understood  in terms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic  electrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the  ferroelectric layer.
These findings enable active control of resistance using both electric  and magnetic fields, opening up possibility for multi-state organic spin valves and shed  light on the mechanism of the spin transport in organic spin valves.4 Since the pioneering work by Dediu and Xiong,2–5 many of the follow-up studies have  focused on achieving high magnetoresistance (MR) in organic spin valves (OSV) and  uncovering the underlying transport mechanisms.3,4,6–11 It has been generally acknowledged  that the interfaces between the organic layer and the ferromagnetic electrodes play a critical  role in determining the actual spin-dependent transport mechanism.12–15 Barraud et al studied  the spin transport of an OSV in which the thin organic layer serves as a tunneling barrier as  opposed to a diffusive spacer.16 A spin transport model describing the role of interfacial  spin-dependent metal/organic hybridization on the amplitude and sign of the MR was put  forward.16,17 Recently, Schulz et al. observed a reversal of the spin polarization of extracted  charge carriers by introducing a thin interfacial permanent dipolar layer (LiF).18 This work  indicates that the local electric dipole moment at the interface is important for MR, although  in such a device the added dipolar layer plays only a passive role in terms of controlling MR.
In order to achieve active control of MR, we employ a ferroelectric (FE) thin layer at the  interface in organic spin valves.
The material of choice is PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT), which has a  large polarization (~80 μC/cm2)19.
The PZT layer can induce strong interfacial dipoles and  built-in electric field between the organic spacer layer and the ferromagnetic electrode.
The  interfacial dipole is switchable by external electric field, potentially allowing the control of  the spin polarization of injected carriers in organic spintronics.
Our fabricated organic spin valves consist a 65 nm Alq3 (tris-[8-hydroxyquinoline] aluminum)5 layer sandwiched between a 5-nm-thick PZT layer epitaxially grown on a 30-nm-thick  La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) film buffered SrTiO3 (STO) substrate, and a 10-nm-thick (nominal  thickness) cobalt layer with gold capping.
In this LSMO/PZT/Alq3/Co junction (FE-OSV),  Co and LSMO serve as top and bottom magnetic electrodes, respectively.
The device  structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1a.
As discussed in the following, such kind of  devices exhibit striking tunability, i.e. both the amplitude and sign of MR are tunable due to  the presence of the ferroelectric PZT.
Surface morphology and the polarization reversal of the PZT films  After epitaxial growth of PZT on LSMO/STO, the PZT layer has a smooth surface with  atomically flat terraces, as characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shown in Fig.  1b.
This provides an ideal base for preparing a well-defined Alq3/PZT interface.
The purpose  of introducing the 5-nm-thick-PZT is to tune the energy level alignment between the Alq3 and  LSMO layers because the polarization in PZT is switchable by applying an electric field.
Therefore, the polarization reversal of the PZT is crucial.
Here we have characterized the  polarization reversal of the PZT films used in the FE-OSV devices with piezoelectric force  microscopy (PFM).
Fig. 1c shows a PFM image of the PZT film with a part of the film poled  by a conducting tip with +/-2.5V relative to the LSMO bottom electrode.
It shows that the  polarization of the as-grown films is pointing “up”, and a clear reversal of polarization  between “up” and “down” states can be created by sign reversal of the applied voltage.
Fig. 1d shows the voltage dependence of the polarization.
It is clear that the polarization of the6 PZT film (5 nm in thickness) starts to switch to the “down” state when the voltage of the  scanning probe exceeds 0.8 V.
The polarization reversal of the PZT in the FE-OSV is  characterized by the measurements of the hysteretic polarization-voltage dependence.
As  shown in Fig. 1e, with the Alq3/Co/Au layers on top of PZT, the coercive voltage is ~ 2 V.  Fig. 1f shows the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) image for the cross section of  the FE-OSV.
No significant diffusion of Co atoms into the Alq3 layer is observed.
Hysteretic behavior of the MR  It has been known that MR depends sensitively on the measuring voltage (VMR).
Previous  studies indicated that MR of LSMO/Alq3/Co junctions (LSMO-OSV) increases with  decreasing VMR, reaching a maximum when VMR is close to zero.5,16 For our FE-OSV  junctions, its MR depends not only on VMR, but also on the history of the voltage applied,  giving rise to a strong hysteretic behavior.
We characterize this hysteretic behavior by  measuring MR(VMR) profile after applying a ramping voltage (VMAX) that is larger than VMR.
(see Supplementary Fig. S3 for the detailed measurement protocol).
As shown in Fig. 2a, for a FE-OSV containing an as-grown PZT layer, the MR (at T = 11K)  is always negative and is the largest when VMR is near zero, which is similar to numerous  previous studies on LSMO-OSV2-6, 8-11.
The different features in the FE-OSV are: 1) the  MR(VMR) profile is strongly affected by the initial voltage (VMAX) applied; 2) a positive  (negative) VMAX leads to a negative (positive) shift of the MR(VMR) profile along the VMR7 axis (Fig. 2b to d).
This shift (ΔV) is closely tied to the hysteretic behavior of the PZT layer  (so-called minor loops, see Fig. 1e) and increases with increasing VMAX, as shown in Fig. 2e.
The hysteretic behavior of the MR was not observed in organic spin valves without the FE  layer, including a conventional LSMO/Alq3/Co organic spin valve (LSMO-OSV) and a  LSMO/STO/Alq3/Co organic spin valve (STO-OSV) in which the 5 nm PZT is replaced by 5  nm STO (see Suppl. Info.
Fig. S5 and S7 for detailed MR loops and MR(VMR) profiles).
This  indicates that the hysteretic behavior of the MR in FE-OSV is tied to the presence of PZT.
The distinctly different behavior between the FE-OSV and the PZT-free organic spin valves  (LSMO-OSV and STO-OSV) also allow us to exclude the possibility of resistive bistability  mechanism caused by the existence of the trap states or current conduct path inside the Alq3  layer20,21, since otherwise similar MR behavior should be observed in all three types of  devices.
We have also performed measurements on a LSMO/PZT/Co magnetic tunnel  junction (FE-MTJ, see Fig.S6).
While VMAX affects the MR(VMR) profile which confirms the  results of Pantel et al. 28 and Valencia et al.,30 it does not induce any shift of the MR(VMR)  profile along the VMR axis.
The comparison of the MR(VMR) profiles of the FE-OSV and the  FE-MTJ suggests that the effective voltage generated by the dipole of the PZT (instead of the  interfacial bonding) is responsible for the hysteretic behavior of the MR in the FE-OSV.
The  FE-MTJ does not show hysteretic behavior of MR because no direct dipole exists on the  surface of the PZT due to the screening effect from the two metal electrodes in direct contact  with the PZT layer.8   A schematic model is illustrated in Fig. 3 to explain this hysteretic behavior of MR in the  FE-OSV.
When a VMAX is applied to the junction, the polarization of the PZT gets modified.
Due to the dipole moment created by the electric polarization of PZT, the effective voltage  Veff applied on the Alq3 layer equals VMR+, where  is the vacuum level shift caused by the  remnant dipole moment of PZT.
When a positive (negative) VMAX is applied,  becomes  larger (smaller), which explains why the MR (VMR) profile can be shifted by VMAX.
Switching of the MR sign  Remarkably, a reversal of the polarization of the PZT layer leads to a sign change of the MR  in the FE-OSV.
After measuring the MR and MR(VMR) profile (Fig. 4 a-c) for the FE-OSV  device B (PZT layer in the as-grown state), we measured polarization-voltage dependence up  to +/- 5 V.
The measurement ended at -5.0 V in order to pole the PZT to the “down” state.
The MR measurements of the FE-OSV device after this treatment are shown in Fig. 4d, e, g,  and h. The shape of the MR(VMR) profile changes dramatically, as shown in Fig. 4i.
In  particular, the sign of the MR changes from negative (Fig. 4a and b) to positive (Fig. 4d and  g and h) for a certain range of VMR.
A close correlation between the polarization of PZT and  the sign of the MR can be identified by comparing the hysteretic behavior of the MR(VMR)  profile and the possible minor polarization-voltage loop of the PZT, as illustrated in Fig. 4f,  i.e. when the polarization of PZT is negative enough (more “down” state), the MR becomes  positive.9   The physical origin of MR sign of the LSMO/Alq3/Co junctions has been studied previously  by Barraud et al using a scanning probe approach.16 It was argued that firstly, the spin  polarization alignment P* at the Co/Alq3 interface16 is positive when electrons move from Co  to Alq3, i.e. P*(Alq3Co)>0 where the arrow indicates the direction of the electric current;3,22  secondly, the density of states for Alq3 at the Alq3/LSMO interface is spin polarized due to  the coupling between the two materials, causing P*(LSMOAlq3)<0 when the Alq3 serves as  a diffusive spacer.16 Following these arguments, Barraud et al concluded that the sign of MR  at small measurement voltages is determined by the sign of the product of P*(Alq3Co) and  P*(LSMOAlq3); the result is negative.
However, according to our observation, inserting a  thin layer (5 nm) of as-grown PZT or STO between Alq3 and LSMO results in no sign change  of MR, indicating no sign change of P*(LSMOAlq3).
These results cannot be readily  explained by the model of Barraud et al,16 because there are no strong couplings between  Alq3 and LSMO layers when they are separated by the PZT or STO layer.
In order to understand the negative MR in the LSMO-OSV or STO-OSV and the switching of  MR sign in FE-OSV, we propose the following model based on the relative energy level  alignment between Alq3 and LSMO.
Here we consider mainly the hole transport because for  Alq3 the energy difference between the HOMO and Fermi levels of the two metallic LSMO  and Co electrodes are much smaller than that between the LUMO and the Fermi levels (See  the Supp.
Info., Fig. S7).5,18,23 As shown in Fig. 5a, when the polarization of the PZT layer is10 pointing “up” (the as-grown state) or zero (the same case as for STO), the hole injection from  the LSMO electrode for positive VMR is from the Fermi level (which lies in the spin majority  band) of LSMO to the HOMO of Alq3, which is the same as in the LSMO-OSV.
Therefore,  P*(LSMOAlq3)<0, corresponding to a negative MR considering P*(Alq3Co)>0 as  discussed above.3,22 When the polarization of the PZT layer is pointing “down”, the HOMO  of A1q3 is shifted up due to the dipole moment of PZT.
Therefore, another state of the LSMO  with opposite spin polarization may be accessible (Fig. 5b).
Hence, P*(LSMOAlq3)  changes the sign and becomes positive, corresponding to a reversed, positive MR.
Our proposed model relies on two key assumptions: 1) the dipole moment of the PZT layer  shifts the Alq3 HOMO level; and 2) the shift of the Alq3 HOMO level results in a shift of the  initial state of LSMO for the hole injection between energy band of opposite spin  polarizations.
The first assumption was used by Schultz et al. to explain the MR sign reversal  in a FeCo/Alq3/LiF/NiFe junction by proposing a shift of the HOMO of Alq3 due to the  dipole moment of LiF layer.18 The second assumption can be justified by the half metallicity  of LSMO.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the conduction band of LSMO splits into spin majority and  minority bands due to the exchange interaction, causing half metallicity because the Fermi  level lies within the fully polarized spin majority band.24–26 Therefore, when the HOMO of  Alq3 is shifted up due to the reversal of dipole moment of PZT, the initial state of LSMO for  hole injection may change to spin minority band with opposite spin polarization.
Note that  this reversed dipole moment of PZT needs to be large enough to shift the HOMO level of  Alq3 to ‘reach’ the spin minority band of LSMO and obtain reversed positive MR values.11 Otherwise only negative MR values will be observed, as shown in Fig. 4f (also see Suppl. Info. Fig. S8).
Besides changing the energy level alignments, switching the electric polarization of the  ferroelectric layer may also modify the coupling between the ferroelectric layer and the  magnetic electrode, depending on the detailed electronic structure of the electrode and the  nature of the electric polarization of the ferroelectric material.27,28 These effects may also  change the spin polarization at the interface between the ferroelectric material and the metal  electrode.27,28 However, both the magnetic structure of the LSMO and the spin polarization of  the PZT are not expected to be affected very much by the electric polarization of the PZT,  because of the robust magnetic properties of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 with given composition (far  from the metal-insulator phase boundary) and the large distance between the Mn site from  LSMO and Ti sites from PZT at the interface.28–30     Another possible scenario involves the change of carrier type when the energy level  alignment between LSMO and Alq3 is changed: the carriers take the path of the HOMO  (LUMO), i.e. hole (electron) transport in Alq3 when the energy levels of Alq3 is shifted  “down” (“up”) due to the “up” (“down”) polarization of the PZT layer.
This, however,  contradicts our experimental observations because in the FE-OSV with the as-grown (“up”  polarization) PZT, the MR is negative, the same as that in the STO-OSV or LSMO-OSV  without any interfacial layers, suggesting that the carrier type in FE-OSV is most probably12 holes instead of electrons, as in the STO-OSV or LSMO-OSV.     Conclusion and outlook  The active control of the energy level alignment between the electrodes and the organic  material, manifested here in the active control of the MR, not only carries promises for  multistate control of organic spin-valve devices, but will also impact other organic electronic  devices, in particular those applied in photovoltaics and solid state lighting.
Specifically, the  charge carrier injection efficiency of the organic light emitting diode (OLED) is determined  by the relative alignment between the Fermi energy of the electrode and the energy levels of  the organic material.31 The charge collection efficiency in an organic photovoltaic (OPV)  device also depends on the alignment of the energy levels of the acceptor organic material  and the electrode.32 Therefore, the realization of the active control of the level alignment  using a ferroelectric interfacial layer demonstrated in this letter may also lead to successful  optimization of other organic electronic devices by tailoring the energy landscape of the  comprising materials using a tunable interfacial layer.13 Method Summary  Device fabrication: PZT, STO (5 nm) and LSMO (30 nm) thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (001) substrate  by pulsed laser deposition were fabricated into bottom electrodes using conventional wet-etch  optical lithography.
