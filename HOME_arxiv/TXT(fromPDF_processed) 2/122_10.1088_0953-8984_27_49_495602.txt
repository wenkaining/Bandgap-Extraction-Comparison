F Mitchell2  *ylli@aps.anl.gov  1Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA  2Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA   3Quantum Condensed Matter Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN 37831, USA    We show evidence that the competition between the antiferromagetic metallic phase and  the charge- and orbital-ordered insulating phase at the reentrant phase boundary of a layered  manganite, LaSr2Mn2O7, can be manipulated using ultrafast optical excitation.
The time- dependent evolution of the Jahn-Teller superlattice reflection, which indicates the formation of  the charge and orbital order, was measured at different laser fluences.
The laser-induced  enhancement and reduction the Jahn-Teller reflection intensity shows a reversal of sign between  earlier (~10 ns) and later (~150 ns) time delays during the relaxation after photo excitation.
This  effect is consistent with a scenario whereby the laser excitation modulates the local competition  between the metallic and the insulating phases.
*ylli@aps.anl.gov      1The essence of strongly correlated materials stems from competition among symmetry- broken quantum states, such as high-temperature superconductivity, and charge-, spin- and  orbital-ordered phases[1].
Among many strongly correlated materials, colossal magnetoresistive  (CMR) manganites are a prototypical system with complex couplings among charge, orbital,  spin, and lattice orders.
It is generally believed that local lattice distortions of the MnO6  octahedra accompany anti-ferromagnetic, charge- and orbital- ordered (COO) phases on the one  hand, and the mixed-valence character promotes metallic ferromagnetic double exchange on the  other hand.
The transport properties are determined by the mutual competition of these phases.
They have been widely studied due to the intriguing physics and technological potential for  magnetic memory, logic, etc., arising from their half-metallicity controllable via both magnetic  field and light.
By directly or indirectly modifying different degrees of freedom, a plethora of  experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of using ultrafast laser pulses to create and probe  novel transient states that are inaccessible via adiabatic or static thermal methods [2–4].
Manganites come in several families of structures.
The reduced dimensionality in bilayer  manganites (La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7) [5,6] amplifies the effect of entropy change in the temperature  regime near the phase transitions and offers a unique opportunity to study the ordering dynamics.
For x close to 0.5, a COO insulator phase is sandwiched between a low-temperature  antiferromagnetic metallic (AFMM) phase and a high-temperature (> 220 K) paramagnetic  metallic (PMM) phase (Fig. 1 (a)).
The AFMM phase transforms into the COO phase when the  transition temperature is approached from below, representing a spin-charge order critical phase  point observed only in a few manganite compounds[7–10].
At x~0.5, the COO is of  checkerboard form characterized by a 4 × 4 superlattice, whereas at x~0.6, the COO has been  shown by x-ray resonant scattering to adopt a bistripe-order of a 5 × 5 superlattice [11–13].
2There are many studies, under adiabatic or static conditions, on the complex ground states in the  AFMM phase[14,15], the formation of the COO[11–13]  the COO-associated Jahn-Teller (JT)  distortion[11,12], and the correlation between the magnetization and the transport properties [16,17].
In this paper, we report evidence of non-thermal dynamic control of the metallic and the  COO insulator phases in the x=0.505 compound using ultrafast laser pulses by measuring the  COO-associated JT distortion dynamics.
By varying the laser fluence we were able to either  enhance or reduce the transient JT x-ray reflection, which is consistent with photo-induced  mutual phase conversion between the metallic and insulator phases.
This phase conversion has  been studied in Pr0.55(Ca0.75Sr0.25)0.45MnO3  thin film samples [9,10] via monitoring the transport  and optical spectroscopy.
The current pump-probe experiment provides direct structural evidence  of the competition between the photoexcited metallic and COO insulator phases.
LaSr2Mn2O7 has a tetragonal structure with a=b=3.87 Å and c=20.1 Å.
The sample, 2 mm  by 2.5 mm by 0.7 mm in size, was grown using the floating zone technique[18].
A phase  diagram around x=0.5 is shown in Fig. 1 (a).
The sample surface is naturally cleaved.
The  magnetization was characterized by a SQUID magnetometer.
The x-ray measurements were  conducted at the 7-ID beam line at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)[19].
The static temperature dependence of the COO was measured at the (0.75 1.25 6) JT  superlattice reflection that is due to the localization of the Mn3+ eg electrons[11,12].
The  temperature dependence of the JT reflection intensity is compared with the magnetization in Fig.  1(b, c).
The comparison is very similar to that between the transport and the magnetization (Fig.  2 in [17]), but with a transitional temperature region (labelled as TR throughout this paper)  between 100 K and 135 K, where the JT reflection gradually increases to the maximum.
The JT  3superlattice reflection peak position was observed to have a negligible dependence on the  temperature.
For the pump probe measurement, the sample was cooled down to 16 K and then raised  to and kept at 49 K in a Displex cryogenic stage, putting the system on the warming loop of Fig. 1 (c).
Laser pulses with duration less than 100 fs at 800 nm (1.55 eV) were delivered to the  sample at normal incidence through a fused silica window at a repetition rate of 5 kHz, with a  spot size of about 2.5 mm by 2 mm (full width at half maximum).
The laser penetration depth  was estimated to be about ~50 nm using the optical data for a composition with close doping  level from ref.[20].
To match the x-ray (12 keV) and laser penetration depths, the x-ray incidence  angle was set at 0.22 degree[21].
Note that the scattering geometry is asymmetric and the x-ray  exit angle is 19°.
An example of the diffraction peak is depicted in Fig. 1 (d), showing a broad,  but well-defined peak with no spurious contamination.
The experiment was performed in the 24-bunch mode of the APS with a bunch-to-bunch  spacing of 153 ns.
An avalanche photodiode gated at the laser repetition rate of 5 kHz with 4  gates was used to record the diffraction data.
For the “early” channel, the gate was set to observe  the bunch that coincided with the laser pump pulse.
The “late” channel was further delayed by  153 ns to gate the next bunch in the storage ring.
Two additional gates were set at 3.682 μs  before the early and late channels, i.e., one round trip of the storage ring prior, to measure the  “no-laser” signal from the same photon bunches.
The incoming beam intensity was also  monitored for normalization of the x-ray counts.
The x-ray pulse duration is about 100 ps.
Further details of the diffraction measurements are provided in the Supplemental Materials [21].
The pump-probe measurement was performed by changing the time delay of the laser  pump relative to the x-ray probe at several laser fluences.
The “no-laser” JT diffraction signal at  4(0.75 1.25 6) was found to be nontrivially dependent on the laser fluence, shown in Fig. 2.
This  is the intensity I of the JT reflection at 3.68 µs before the arrival of the laser pulse or,  equivalently, 196 µs after the previous laser pulse.
This “no-laser” JT reflection was stable  during the measurement at each laser fluence (lasts about 25 min), as shown in Fig. 2 by the error  bars.
This fluence dependence of the JT reflection has features somewhat similar to its  temperature dependence in Fig. 1 (c), indicating a slow recovery of the sample from the laser  excitation.
The change of the JT intensity is likely a convolution of changes in the JT structure  factor and the relative population of the COO phase representing an effective “initial state” for  the pump probe measurement.
The transient difference signal, ∆I(t)=I(t)-I(t-3.6 µs)), i.e., the signal with the “no-laser”  signal (Fig. 2) subtracted, is presented in Fig. 3 at several laser fluencies as a function of delay  between the laser and the x-ray.
Positive or negative signals indicate an enhancement or  reduction of the JT reflection, respectively.
∆I depends on both the delay and the laser fluence,  which is summarized in Fig. 4, showing the average difference signal in the time windows of 6- 10 ns (early) and 159-163 ns (late) after the laser excitation.
For all fluences, ∆I before laser  pulse is essentially zero.
Note that the signal level of a few percent  can be compared with the  excitation efficiency estimated from the laser fluence, i.e., about 6% Mn ions in the top 50 nm  probed layer can be excited at 1 mJ/cm2 (40 photons per nm2) assuming 100% absorption [21].
There is a striking feature in Fig. 4: the early and the late ∆I have opposite signs.
At low  laser fluencies (<3.3 mJ/cm2), the early ∆I is positive but the late ∆I is negative.
At fluencies  between 4.2 and 6.3 mJ/cm2, a zero or negative early ∆I is observed, albeit accompanied by a  5positive late ∆I. Clearly the laser excitation can enhance or reduce the JT reflection  instantaneously, but the relaxation that follows can reverse this trend in 150 ns.
To understand the result in Fig. 4, it is critical to characterize the pseudo ground state as a  function of the laser fluence, as shown in Fig. 2.
To do this, we assume that after 0.2 ms, residual  heating effect dominates the sample bulk.
Thus we apply a two-temperature, 1-D thermal heat  diffusion model for the actual sample thickness of about 0.7 mm, for which the detail is given in  SI [21].
The simulation is benchmarked by the 7.74 mJ/cm2 case.
We note in the data shown in  Fig. 3, the JT intensity has an instantaneous drop (<100 ps), of about 15%, followed by a slow  decrease over more than 100 ns.
The instantaneous reduction can be assigned as non-thermal,  photon excitation of the COO states that destroys the JT distortion.
The relaxation of these  excited states, however, leads to slow heating of the sample partially beyond the COO-PMM  transition temperature (TCP) thus further decrease of the JT intensity.
Therefore, the sample  temperature before the laser pulse must be below TCP at 220 K. The later time (160 ns)  temperature, however, must exceeds TCP for the JT intensity to further decrease.
Using the  thermal simulation, we can determine a total heating efficiency of 36%.
The spatial temporal  evolution of the bulk temperature is shown in Fig. 5 (a) using a CW simulation (For detailed  explanation, see the supplementary information [21]), where the sample temperature reaches a  equilibrium at 180 K within 2 seconds.
The corresponding temperature evolution due to pulsed  laser excitation (assuming all absorbed laser energy convert to heat immediately) is shown in  Fig. 5 (b).
The temperature as a function of the laser fluence is shown in Fig. 5 (c), where the  temperature for the first 100 nm of the sample before, at 8 ns (early) and 160 ns (late) after the  laser exposure are given.
We can see that at a fluence above 4 mJ/cm2, if all the energy is  6immediately converted to heat, the temperature would be higher than TCP, leading 100%  reduction of the JT reflection, contradicting the experiment observation.
This confirms that the  instantaneous excitation is non-thermal.
For the 7.7 mJ/cm2 case the late temperature is slightly  above TCP.
These simulations also indicate that after the initial excitation, the sample has a  tendency to heat up probably due to the relaxation of the excited states via phonon emission.
The thermal simulation confirms that the state before the each laser exposure is indeed  thermally stabilized, which allows a direct comparison of the initial state to the static mapping of  the JT intensity to a temperature dependence, as shown in Fig. 2 (b).
It shows a clear trend of the  initial dominating phase shifting from AMM to COO phases as laser fluence increases.
Interestingly, the highest JT reflection reaches the maximum in the TR region and is not directly  correlated with static peak position, but are within a factor of two of these in the COO phase.
Due to the stable signal we observed at each laser fluence, this is unlikely due to spurious  experiment errors.
However, the underlying physics needs further study.
We also noticed the JT  signal at laser fluence lower than 1 mJ/cm2, which we attribute to the laser excitation of a lower  temperature phase with JT distortion that is stable at  temperature lower than 75 K as reported in  [11,15].
With the initial condition determined, and noting that non-thermal photo excitation has  been observed to convert metal into insulator [10,22,23] and vice versa in other manganites and  oxides [9,24,25], we propose that the observed phenomena in Fig. 4 as evidence of photon driven  phase competition between the metallic and the insulating phases.
We propose that the quasi- equilibrated “initial state” before the arrival of the laser pulse is phase-separated, a common  scene in many strongly correlated oxides[1],  with coexisting AFMM and COO clusters up to the  AMM-COO phase transition at about TAC=136 K.   7In this case, both AFMM-to-COO and the COO-to-metal phase conversions occur upon  laser excitation at least up to TAC as has been reported in previous experiments [9,10].
The  former conversion will enhance and the latter will reduce the intensity of the JT reflection.
Assuming that the excitation rates are about the same for both conversions, the net change in the  JT reflection immediately after the laser pulse is thus determined by the fraction of each phase in  the “initial state.” Qualitatively, if the initial state is dominated by the AFMM phase, more COO  clusters will be generated than melted, leading to an immediate enhancement of the JT reflection.
When the COO dominates, however, more COO clusters will be melted than generated, thus a  net immediate reduction of the JT intensity.
At the same time, the initial fractional contribution is  dependent on the equilibrium temperature of the sample and due to the surrounding structure and  spin “pressure”, as coined in refs. [9,10].
It is expected that the newly generated non-dominant  phase clusters, i.e, COO clusters at a low laser fluence and metallic clusters at a high laser  fluence, decay faster than the newly generated dominant phase clusters, i.e., AFMM clusters at a  low fluence and COO clusters at a high fluence.
Our experiments are not able to determine the  final form of the local electronic state immediately after melting of the COO clusters.
At a low  laser fluence, it is likely spin-ordered due to the low temperature dominant AFMM phase or will  become spin-ordered soon due to surrounding “spin pressure”[9].
At a high laser fluence, these  metallic clusters can be PMM.
Based on this argument, we can now qualitatively interpret the observations in Fig. 4.
At  low laser fluence the JΤ reflection sees an immediate enhancement after the laser excitation  because more COO insulator clusters are generated than destroyed as the initial state is  dominated by the AFMM phase.
The difference signal turns negative later when these laser- generated COO clusters decay while the laser-generated metallic clusters stay.
At high fluence,  8the behaviors of the newly generated COO and metallic phases reverse, and the opposite trend is  seen.
It is expected that the trend reverses at an initial state where sample reaches AFMM-COO  transition at TAC.
Our data also indicate a relaxation time of the laser-generated non-dominant  phase of about 100-200 ns.
Non-thermal mechanisms modifying both local spin order and the COO phase due to  photo excitation have been widely discussed in the literature though the details are still under  discussion.
The complication here is the competition between the COO insulating and the spin- ordered metallic phases.
Melting of the COO phase[9,24–26] is likely due to charge transfer of  t2g electrons into the eg orbit thru either an intra-site [27] or an inter-site [28,29] d-d transition,  leading to an increase of the electron itinerancy which couples to the phonon and releases the JT  distortion.
Evidence further shows that it is also possible to induce magnetization in manganites  via photo-excitation [26,30]; thus in the low fluence AFMM-dominated phase, the surrounding  spin “pressure” may coalesce the metallic clusters into the spin-ordered phase.
At the high  fluence COO-dominated phase, melting routes to either PMM or AFMM phases are possible.
The formation of the COO phase is accompanied by melting of the AFMM spin order, i.e.,  ferromagnetic order in the a-b plane.
It is suggested that a non-thermal melting of the spin order  [10] can be accomplished via photo induced spin-flip for the eg electrons against the Hund  coupling energy [31,32].
This spin flip may lead, within the ferromagnetic plane, to a local spin  correlation favored by the COO and the JT distortion.
The physics picture of photon manipulation of the competition between the metallic and  the insulating phases[9,10] qualitatively explained the dynamic behavior, but cannot fully  explain the higher JT intensity in the TR region.
Although bilayer manganite presents an array of  exotic properties, there is surprisingly very limited study of dynamic properties and this work is,  9to our knowledge, the first study of such dynamics of this material.
Clearly, further effort is  needed to understand the result.
It will be very illuminating to selectively excite the lattice at the  stretched mode at17 µm [33] in either the metallic or the COO-dominated phase to clarify the  role of lattice distortion in facilitating the complex coupling and competition in the system [2,4,34].
In summary, we have shown evidence of the dynamic competition between spin and  charge order in the bilayer manganite LaSr2Mn2O7.
Our result is qualitatively consistent with a  scenario wherein non-thermal laser excitation leads to the transient modulation of the relative  fractions of the metallic and the COO insulating phases in an effective phase-separated initial  state.
It also shows that the relative relaxation time is important in determining system dynamics.
The experiment suggests the feasibility of controlling the competition between the two phases at  a much faster time scale than previously observed[9,10].

The x-ray beam is controlled and monitored by a set of beam  position monitor feedbacks and the beam loss does not change the beam size, beam alignment,  as well as the timing between the laser and x-ray.
It did not otherwise affect the data  collection.

CW (Top) and pulsed (middle) thermal simulation of the sample temperature evolution at  7.7 mJ/cm2.
The temperature stabilizes within 2 s at 180 K. Laser incidence from the left.
(Bottom)  Temperature as a function of the laser fluence at different times after the laser pulse, assuming a  total heating efficiency of 36% based on the benchmark using the data at 7.7 mJ/cm2.
For fluence  larger than 4.5 mJ/cm2, the early temperature far exceeds the COO-PMM transition temperature,  excluding heating as the possible cause of the early signal.
18Supplemental materials  X-ray parameters and setup procedure The x rays were focused by Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors; the spot size is estimated to be 50  µm by 50 µm on the sample.
The beam divergence of 0.04° was dominated by the focusing  optics.
With the small incidence angle of 0.22°, the x-ray foot print overfilled the sample, so the  laser spot size was set to illuminate the whole sample (~2 mm by 2.5 mm).
The x-ray beam was controlled and monitored by a beam-position monitor operating with  feedback; thus, the beam losses that occurred during the measurements did not change the beam  size or beam alignment, nor the timing between the laser and x-ray.
The temperature control was via a Displex cryostat (Advanced Research Systems).
The  sample was attached to the sample stage using silver paint.
In all the delay scans, the recorded  sample stage temperature variation was less than 0.2 K. With the temperature changing from 80  K to 30 K, the sample height changed less than 20 µm, mostly due to the temperature change of  the sample holder; therefore position change due to laser irradiation is not expected.
The  compressor connected to the Displex, however, did cause the stage to vibrate horizontally at  amplitude of about 50 µm or less at about 1 Hz.
However, this movement is averaged out during  the 10 to 20-s data collection time.
Our temperature scan has demonstrated that there is no drift  of the (0.75 1.25 6) peak (within our resolution) as the temperature is changed, indicating the  thermal expansion of the sample is very small.
A six-circle Huber diffractometer was used in the experiment to capture the diffraction  peaks.
The Huber includes sample angles of pitch (Eta), roll (Chi), and yaw (Phi), and detector  horizontal (Nu) and vertical (Del) angles, and a sample- table horizontal rotation (Mu).
The  diffractometer was controlled with SPEC (Certified Scientific Software) during the experiment  using psi-circle geometry [1][S1].
We used the (0 0 6) and (1 1 6) Bragg peaks to determine the  orientation matrix, from which it was straightforward to find the (0.75 1.25 6) superstructure  peak.
We operated in a SPEC mode in which the x-ray incidence angle can be selected; we set  the x-ray incidence angle at 0.22° for all measurements in this experiment.
The most important  systematic error is due to the uncertainty in determining the zero incidence angle for the sample  in the first step due to the small sample size and beam divergence.
We estimate the error to bearound 0.05° using the zero degree cut method, however, the terraces exists in the naturally  cleaved sample surfaces may also add to this error.
Together with the x-ray beam divergence, we  are expecting larger uncertainties in the incidence angle.
The configuration of the diffractormeter  was maintained throughout each measurement once set and we do not expect any deviation from  the set positions or angles for either the sample or the x-ray detector.
Two temperature 1-D thermal simulation of the static fluence dependent initial state  A two temperature heat diffusion model is described by the following equations    𝐶𝐶𝑒𝑒(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒) 𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕= ∂ ∂x ቂ𝐾𝐾𝑒𝑒(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒, 𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙) 𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕ቃ−𝐺𝐺(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒)(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒−𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙) + 𝑆𝑆൫𝑥𝑥 , 𝑡𝑡൯37T,        (S1)  𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙(𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙) 𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕= ∂ ∂x ቂ𝐾𝐾𝑙𝑙(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒, 𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙) 𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕ቃ+ 𝐺𝐺(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒)(𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒−𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙)37T,           (S2) Here Te, Tl are electron and phonon temperatures, Ce and Cl are the electron and phonon specific  heat, Ke and Kl are the electron and phonon conductivity.
G is the coupling coefficient between  electron and phonons.
S is the heat source term.
The heat capacity as a function of temperature from Gu et al.,[2] for x=0.5 compound is  used.
For c-axis phonon heat conductivity as a function of temperature, we use the data measured  by Matsukawa et al [3] for an x=0.6 compound.
The c-axis electron heat conductivity is at least 2  orders of magnitude smaller [3] and is ignored.
The a-b plane phonon conductivity is about 3  times bigger but as the side of the sample is only in contact with vacuum thus justifies the 1 D  model.
For the electron-phonon coupling we used the measured number G= 5e15 W/(m3 K) from  a perovskite compound La0.7M0.3MnO3 by Averitt et al [4].
The boundary temperature is set at  the sample mount temperature of 49 K.   A laser pulse of 60 fs duration is used which deposit the energy in the sample with an  absorption length of 50 nm.
Two types of simulation are performed.
The first one is used to  determine the equilibrium temperature of the sample with a continuous laser flux equivalent to  the average laser power (CW simulation), the second type uses a pulsed heat source emulating  the laser to examine the temperature evolution for each heating cycle (pulsed simulation) taken  the temperature profile of the CW simulation as the initial condition.
Cross check between the  two types of simulation gives excellent agreement.
To calculate the laser absorption, we use the complex refractive index at 800 nm of  1.59+1.29i is measured for x=0.34 composition, ref. [5].
Estimate of the nonthermal laser excitation effect       For direct photoexcitation, assuming an excitation event corresponds to absorption of one  photon by one Mn ion, a pump fluence of 1 mJ cm-2 corresponds to an excitation rate of 6% for a  50 nm surface layer.
At 7 mJ/cm2, the effect is 40%.
This is consistent with the signal level we  observe.
