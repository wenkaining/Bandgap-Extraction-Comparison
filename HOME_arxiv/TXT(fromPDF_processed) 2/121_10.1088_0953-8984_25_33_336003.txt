Whereas the crystal structure is suggestive of the presence of a quasi-2D network of Cu2+ (S = 1/2) buckled staircase Kagome layers, the χ(T ) data show magnetic anisotropy and three magnetic anomalies at temperatures, TN1 ∼36 K, TN2 ∼25 K, TN3 ∼17 K, respectively.
The χ(T ) data follow the Curie-Weiss law above 200 K and a Curie-Weiss temperature θCW ∼−150 K is obtained.
The data deviate from the simple Curie-Weiss law below 200 K, which is well above TN1, suggesting the presence of compet- ing magnetic interactions.
The magnetic anomaly at TN3 appears to be of ﬁrst-order from magnetization measurements, although our heat-capacity Cp(T ) results do not display any anomaly at TN3.
The hopping integrals obtained from our electronic structure calculations suggest the presence of signiﬁcant intra-Kagome (next-nearest neighbor and diagonal) and inter-Kagome couplings.
These couplings take the PbCu3TeO7 system away from a disordered ground state and lead to long-range order, in contrast to what might be expected for an ideal (isotropic) 2D Kagome system.

INTRODUCTION Frustrated magnetism in Kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnetic systems (KHAF) has been a major subject in condensed matter physics due to their unconventional, exotic ground states which emerge from the interplay between geometrical frustration and low-dimensional quantum eﬀects.1,2 In particular, quantum ﬂuctuations for S = 1/2 systems are found to be strong among KHAF and can lead to interesting behavior like that of a spin liquid.3 Theoretical studies on ideal S = 1/2 isotropic KHAF lattice have demonstrated that it has a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB)-like disordered ground state.4,5 Recent numerical studies6 have also predicted that its ground state is a spin liquid with a small spin-gap (∆/kB) of (0.03 ∼0.05)J/kB to its triplet excited state (where J is the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor (nn) spins).
A limited number of experimental realizations of structurally ideal, S = 1/2, KHAF have been found, which include Zn and Mg-Herberthsmithite, Kapellasite, and Haydeeite.7–9 Among these, Zn-Herberthsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 is the best example to explain isotropic S = 1/2 KHAF behavior.
Experimental studies on Zn-Herberthsmithite have shown that there is no magnetic ordering down to J/kB 3000 K, which implies that it has a disordered ground state.10 But an unambiguous proof for the existence of a spin-gap from an experimental point of view is lacking.
The natural ion exchange of Cu and Zn or Mg is inevitable in these systems, which is probably the main obstacle to detect the intrinsic nature of these S = 1/2 KHAF.
On the other hand, there are a few anisotropic KHAF systems such as Volborthite Cu3V2O7(OH)2.2H2O11 and Vesignieite BaCu3V2O8(OH)212, which do not have much atomic site-disorder, in which the Kagome layers are built by two nearest neighbor (nn) exchange couplings.
These have also been studied to understand the real ground state physics of a Kagome system.
Despite the presence of signiﬁcant anisotropy, these systems show interesting spin dynamics.13 There is another kind of anisotropic Kagome lattice in Rb2Cu3SnF12,14 where the Kagome layer is formed by four exchange couplings and has a spin-gap of 20 K. The pinwheel valence bond solid (VBS) excitations are realized in this anisotropic KHAF system.15 Theoretical predictions also suggest that when the Kagome layer is perturbed with additional exchange couplings such as next-nearest neighbor nnn and diagonal couplings, the system is driven to a novel ordered state from the disordered state of isotropic Kagome layer.16 These predictions prompted us to look for newer S = 1/2, KHAF systems to explore interesting physics associated with the presence of anisotropy and additional couplings.
Herein, we introduce a new anisotropic magnetic system, PbCu3TeO7,18 which has S = 1/2 staircase (buckled) Kagome layers built by Cu and O atoms (see Fig. 1).
This system has Kagome 2layers similar to those of A3V2O8 (A=β-Cu, Ni, Co).19,20 Detailed studies have been done on single crystals of S = 1 and S = 3/2 staircase Kagome systems Ni3V2O8 and Co3V2O8.
The Ni3V2O8 system has four competing magnetic transitions (two incommensurate and two commensurate) below 9 K, one of which is a multiferroic transition at T ∼6 K.21,22 However, Co3V2O8 does not show multiferroicity, which might be due to its high spin state with low quantum ﬂuctuations.
Less work has been done on the S = 1/2 analog β-Cu3V2O8, probably due to non availability of single crystals.
We report here the magnetic properties of PbCu3TeO7.
The magnetic susceptibility χ(T) data indicate that the dominant exchange interactions between Cu2+ ions are antiferromagnetic (AF) with a Curie-Weiss temperature (θCW) of about −150 K. The χ(T) deviates from Curie-Weiss behavior below ∼200 K. We observed a total of three magnetic anomalies (TN1 ∼36 K, TN2 ∼25 K, and TN3 ∼16 K) in the χ(T) data of a single crystal.
The magnetic anomalies at TN1 and TN3 were evident only when the applied magnetic ﬁeld H was parallel to the crystallographic a-axis, whereas the one at TN2 could be observed only for H ∥c.
The anomaly at TN3 is ﬁrst order in nature and is ﬁeld sensitive.
On the other hand, heat capacity data in zero ﬁeld (for both polycrystalline and single crystal samples) showed anomalies of TN1 and TN2 only.
The ﬁrst-order transition at TN3 could not be observed by us in heat capacity data.
We suggest that this might be due to the small latent heat involved in this transition.
Our electronic structure calculations in conjunction with our experimental ﬁndings suggest the presence of various competing magnetic couplings, in addition to nn, in PbCu3TeO7 which in turn cause a deviation from the superﬁcially anticipated regular Kagome geometry leading to long-range order (LRO). II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Polycrystalline samples of PbCu3TeO7 were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method using PbO, CuO, and Te precursors.
The stoichiometric amount of chemicals were ground thoroughly and ﬁred at 750 oC for 5 days with three intermediate grindings.
To obtain single crystals, a mixture of PbCu3TeO7 and NaCl/KCl ﬂux in the mass ratio 1 : 2 was charged in an alumina crucible, ﬁred at 800 oC for 24 hrs and then cooled slowly to 650 oC with a cooling rate of 1 oC per hour.
Single crystals were extracted after washing the ﬂux with hot water.
The x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) data were collected using D8 Advance (Bruker) on the single crystal and on (polycrystalline) powder obtained from crushing the crystals.
Magnetic and heat-capacity mea- surements were performed on polycrystalline and single crystal samples using a Physical Property 3Measurement System (PPMS) from Quantum Design.
For heat-capacity, we employed the thermal relaxation method with two time constants (2τ model) to ﬁt the heat-capacity data.
The single crystal used for the magnetization measurements is of mass 2 mg and approximate dimensions 1.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 0.45 mm as shown in Fig. 2(b). III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. X-ray diﬀraction and structural features The single phase nature of the polycrystalline sample was conﬁrmed by comparing the measured XRD pattern with the calculated one generated by powdercel23 using the initial structural param- eters of the orthorhombic space group Pnma (space group No. 62) given by B. Wedel, et al.18 Rietveld reﬁnement of the XRD pattern was done using the Fullprof suite software24 (as shown in Fig. 2(a)).
The lattice parameters obtained from the reﬁnement are a = 10.484 ˚A, b = 6.347 ˚A, and c = 8.807 ˚A.
The obtained atomic positions and occupancies are summarized in Table 1.
These structural parameters are in good agreement with the previously published values.18 A rectangular crystal was placed on a glass slide with the top face (see Fig. 2) parallel to the plane of the slide and XRD was performed.
It resulted in the appearance of only (0ll) peaks as shown in Fig. 2(b)).
This indicates that the top crystal surface (as indicated in Fig. 2) is perpendicular to the [0ll] direction or bc−plane.
This means that the a−axis lies in the as-grown plane of the crystal.
Note that crystallographic a−axis is perpendicular to the staircase Kagome layers, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
We have further taken the Laue pattern of the crystal, and found that the crystallographic a−axis is along the length of the crystal.
The other crystallographic axes (b and c) were also identiﬁed and make roughly 45o with the top plane of the crystal, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b).
The staircase Kagome planes in the PbCu3TeO718 structure are formed by Cu atoms (Cu1 and Cu2) as shown in Fig. 1.
The Cu2+ ions are coupled via O2−ions and form buckled layers in the bc-planes, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
According to the Cu-Cu bond-lengths and the Cu-O-Cu bond- angles, the staircase Kagome plane possibly has four diﬀerent nearest neighbor (nn) exchange constants J1, J2, J3 and J4 (see Fig. 1(b)).
In this staircase Kagome plane, Cu1 atoms form linear chains with the couplings alternating between J2 and J4.
These Cu1 chains are connected with each other via Cu2 atoms with couplings J1 and J3 to form a 2D network.
Other possible magnetic coupling paths are also shown in Fig. 1(f), the hopping integrals for which have been calculated by us.
These are t5, t6, t7, and t8 which are in addition to the nn hoppings t1, t2, t3 4and t4 (corresponding to J1, J2, J3 and J4, respectively).
The Kagome planes are separated by Pb and Te atoms with a small inter-planar distance of about 4 ˚A, which suggests that signiﬁcant three-dimensional couplings between the layers might be present.
B. Magnetic measurements: The magnetization M was measured as a function of temperature T. The dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility χ(= M/H) in the range from 2 K to 370 K for the polycrystalline and single crystal samples of PbCu3TeO7 are shown in Fig. 3(a).
Magnetic measurements were performed on the 2 mg single crystal (shown in Fig. 2(b)) for each of the crystal direction a, b, and c, respectively in an applied magnetic ﬁeld H. The χ(T) data follow a Curie-Weiss behavior in high-T region.
Even in the paramagnetic region, a signiﬁcant anisotropy is seen between the ﬁeld orientation along a and the other two perpendicular directions (b and c).
This means that the intra-Kagome (bc−plane) anisotropy (diﬀerence between b−and c−axis) is small compared to the inter-Kagome anisotropy.
The χ(T) data of the polycrystalline sample lie in between the single crystal data for H ∥a and H ∥bc, but for T > 200 K they are close to the single crystal data of H ∥a, while below 200 K they are closer to the single crystal data for H ⊥a.
The temperature independent magnetic susceptibility χ0 was estimated from polycrystalline data at high−T from 300 K to 800 K (data not shown here).
We subtracted χ0 = −(3±0.3)×10−5 cm3/mol Cu from our measured data and then plotted (χ −χ0)−1 vs T in Fig. 3(b).
The core diamagnetic susceptibility (χcore) of PbCu3TeO7 is calculated to be −5.23 × 10−5 cm3/mol Cu from χcore of individual ions.25 The Van Vleck paramagnetic susceptibility is then estimated to be χvv = χ0 −χcore ∼(2.23±0.3)×10−5 cm3/mol Cu, which is comparable with other cuprates.26 The χ(T) data follow the Curie-Weiss (CW) law  C T−θCW  in the T−range 200 - 370 K where C is the Curie constant and θCW is the Curie-Weiss temperature.
The obtained parameters from the single crystal data are given in the Table II.
The C value corresponds to an eﬀective magnetic moment (µeff) of about 2 µB/Cu, which is slightly larger than the spin-only value for S = 1/2 which is 1.73 µB. The negative θCW indicates that the dominant couplings are antiferromagnetic in nature.
There is a deviation from the Curie-Weiss law below 200 K, which indicates that it is not a simple paramagnet at low−T.
This deviation might be a result of the competitive exchange couplings present in the quasi-2D staircase Kagome planes.
The χ(T) data of polycrystalline samples exhibit a total of three magnetic anomalies at TN1 ∼36 K, TN2 ∼25 K, and TN3 ∼17 K, respectively.
The ordering temperature (TN1) is relatively smaller than θCW and the temperature below which a deviation from CW behavior is seen (200 K), which 5indicates that the system is moderately frustrated.
These three magnetic anomalies (TN1, TN2 and TN3) are also seen in the single crystal data, but with signiﬁcant anisotropy.
All of the anomalies are not evident for each ﬁeld direction.
For instance, the magnetic anomaly TN1 is evident only when H ∥a, and the anomaly at TN2 is seen only for H ∥c.
On the other hand for H ∥b, no clear anomalies were observed.
The anomaly at TN3 is prominent for H ∥a (see Fig. 4).
Although, the appearance of anomalies in the χ(T) data depends on the ﬁeld direction, the transitions are not ﬁeld driven because the two anomalies (TN1 and TN2) appear in zero-ﬁeld heat capacity data as will be discussed in a later section.
Similar H−direction dependent anomalies were also reported in a multiferroic, spiral magnet FeVO4.27 The susceptibility χb (χ(T) for H ∥b) increases below the transition while χa and χc decrease below the transition.
This suggests that b−axis might be the hard-axis of magnetization.
We have also performed dielectric constant and electric polarization versus T down to 2 K on the polycrystalline samples, neither anomaly in the dielectric constant nor electric polarization are observed below the transition temperatures.
In order to obtain insight about the transition at TN3, we have measured M of a collection of carefully oriented crystals (H ∥a), while cooling and warming in diﬀerent H′s of 1 kOe, 5 kOe, 10 kOe, 15 kOe, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4.
The transition at TN3 is sharp and looks diﬀerent from those of at TN1 and TN2.
There is a diﬀerence in the position of the peak for the zero- ﬁeld-cooled warming (ZFCW) data and the ﬁeld-cooled cooling (FCC) data, while no diﬀerence is observed between ZFC warming and FC warming (FCW) data.
This kind of thermal hysteresis is a characteristic feature of a ﬁrst-order phase transition.28 Similar sharp, ﬁrst-order anomalies are also observed at 3.9 K in Ni3V2O821 and 6 K in Co3V2O830 staircase Kagome systems.
Moreover, the observed peak position moves to higher temperatures with increasing H and this variation (summarized in Table III) suggests that the observed ﬁrst-order transition is ferromagnetic in nature.
The TN3 peak also broadens and the diﬀerence between the position (in temperature) of the warming and cooling peak decreases as H increases.
This kind of ﬁeld-induced broadening is also a characteristic feature of the ﬁrst-order transition.29 Finally, the TN3 peak is suppressed in a ﬁeld of about 20 kOe, however TN1 and TN2 peaks remain, more or less, unaﬀected by magnetic ﬁelds upto 70 kOe and do not exhibit any thermal hysteresis like observed for TN3 (data not shown here).
6C. Heat-Capacity measurements The T−dependent heat-capacity Cp of the polycrystalline PbCu3TeO7 samples in the range from 2 to 300 K is presented in Fig. 5.
The Cp(T) data were measured using the PPMS by the thermal relaxation method.
For a magnetic insulator, one expects both lattice and magnetic contributions to the heat-capacity.
We used the Debye model31 to obtain the lattice part in the following manner.
We ﬁt the Cp(T) data in the T−range from 150 K to 300 K with a linear combination of two Debye integrals as given below Cp(T) = 9rNkB X i=1,2 Ci  T θi D 3 xi D Z 0 x4ex (ex −1)2 dx (1) Here r is the number of atoms per formula unit, θi D is a Debye temperature, and xi D = θi D/T (i = 1, 2).
The ﬁtting yields C1 = 0.43±0.05, θ1 D = (280±10) K, C2 = 0.5±0.05, and θ2 D = 772±30 K.
The ﬁtting curve was extrapolated down to 2 K and this was then subtracted from the measured Cp(T).
Magnetic heat-capacity Cm(T) was thus obtained (see inset of Fig. 5).
Sharp anomalies are observed at 36 K and 25 K, which agree well with the anomalies found at TN1 and TN2 in χ(T).
We observed the presence of Cm(T) upto 150 K which is well above TN1, which signiﬁes the presence of magnetic correlations above TN1 and this behavior is also consistent with the magnetic data.
However, we could not detect any transition at TN3 in the data.
In fact, detailed Cp(T) measurements were done around 16 K with a large number of points.
The raw data of the sample temperature as a function of time at each of these temperatures showed a good ﬁt to the 2τ model.
In the case of a ﬁrst-order transition, it has been documented that deviations from the simple 2τ behavior occur for Cp data at the transition temperature.32 In light of the missing supporting evidence for TN3 from the Cp(T) measurement, one may suspect that the existence of TN3 from susceptibility data may not be intrinsic.
On the other hand, the inability to detect similar kind of ﬁrst-order phase transition has also been argued in the literature.32 Some other technique like the adiabatic method or a better pulse-sequence design33 may be needed for measuring small latent heat or entropy change transitions.
Although our heat capacity measurements do not support the existence of the TN3 phase transition, we must stress that the TN3 anomaly has been consistently observed in the magnetization measurements for diﬀerent batches of powder samples as well as single crystals, i.e., the possibility of contribution from external magnetic impurity phase due to diﬀerent preparation conditions or contamination can be ruled out.
More sensitive heat capacity measurement are being planned to clarify this issue.
Overall we conclude that the intrinsic origin 7of this transition is an open question.
The entropy change SM calculated from the magnetic heat-capacity is about 5.63 J/mol K Cu, which is in good agreement with the expected R ln(2S +1) (5.76 J/mol K) for S = 1 2 systems.
The Sm value at transition TN1 is found to be 2.88 J/mol K Cu, which is 50% of the total entropy and the rest of the entropy is released in the paramagnetic region well above TN1, suggesting the presence of frustrated correlations.
The observation of signiﬁcant entropy well above ordering temperature is generally observed in frustrated spin systems.34 Additionally, nearly all the entropy change has taken place by the time one approaches (with decreasing temperature) the TN3 transition.
This is the reason I presume that TN3 is a weak transition such as a slight canting from the AF ordered state to produce weak FM moment.
This might explain the diﬃculty in observing the transition in heat capacity.
D. Electronic structure calculations In order to study the electronic structure of PbCu3TeO7, we have carried out ﬁrst principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the local-density approximation (LDA) by em- ploying the Stuttgart TBLMTO-47 code based on the linear muﬃn-tin orbital (LMTO) method in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA).35 The basis set for the self-consistent electronic structure calculations for PbCu3TeO7 in TB-LMTO ASA includes Pb (s, p), Cu (s, p, d), Te (s, p) and O (s, p) and the rest are downfolded.
A (4, 8, 4) k-mesh has been used for self-consistency.
All the k-space integrations were performed using the tetrahedron method.
In order to ascertain the accu- racy of our ASA calculations we also performed the electronic structure calculation using projected augmented wave (PAW)36 method encoded in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package(VASP).37 The density of states calculated by these two diﬀerent approaches is found to agree well with each other.
In order to extract various hopping integrals between the Cu atoms, we have employed the Nth order muﬃn tin orbital (NMTO) downfolding method.38–40 The non-spin-polarized band structure for PbCu3TeO7 is displayed in Fig. 6.
The bands are plotted along the various high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone corresponding to the or- thorhombic lattice.
All the energies are measured with respect to the Fermi level of the compound.
The characteristic feature of the non-spin-polarized band structure displayed in Fig. 6 is an iso- lated set of twelve bands crossing the Fermi level and these bands are predominantly derived from the antibonding linear combination of Cu-dx2−y2 and O-p states.
These twelve bands are well separated from the low-lying O-p and other Cu -d valence bands.
This isolated Cu-dx2−y2 twelve 8band complex is responsible for the low-energy physics of this compound.
Fig. 7 shows the non- spin-polarized density of states (DOS) of PbCu3TeO7.
As expected, there is strong hybridization between the O-p and Cu-d states.
The occupied Pb-6s states lie below the Fermi level and empty Pb-p and Te-s states are above the Fermi level.
We have employed the NMTO downfolding method to map our LDA results to a low-energy orthogonal tightbinding Hamiltonian by integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom from the all-orbital LDA calculation.
The Fourier transformation of the downfolded Hamiltonian H = P ij tij  c† icj + h.c.  gives the various hopping integrals tij between the Cu atoms.
These hopping integrals will determine the dominant exchange paths for the system.
For the present compound we have kept only the Cu-dx2−y2 orbital for each Cu atom in the unit cell in the basis and integrated out all the rest to derive the low-energy model Hamiltonian.
We show the downfolded bands in Fig. 6 in comparison to the full LDA band structure and the agreement between the two is found to be excellent.
The hopping integrals (> 10 meV) obtained from the NMTO downfolding method are listed in Table IV and V and the exchange paths are indicated in Fig. 1(f) and 1(g).
The strongest hopping in the Kagome plane is t3 between the corner-sharing Cu1 and Cu2 ions.
This hopping is primarily mediated by O2 situated in the basal plane of the Cu1 octahedron forming a strong pdσ antibond with the Cu1 dx2−y2 orbital.
The nn hopping t1 between the edge sharing Cu1 octahedron (see Fig. 1(c)) and Cu2 tetrahedron (see Fig. 1(d)), is found to be much smaller than t3.
In order to obtain further insights, we have plotted the Wannier function of Cu2 dx2−y2 orbital corresponding to the t3 and t1 hoppings (see Fig. 8).
The plot reveals that the Cu2 dx2−y2 orbital forms strong pdσ antibonds with the neighboring oxygens.
We can see that the weight of Wannier function at Cu1 site which is at a distance 3.264 ˚A is large compared to the weight at Cu1 site which is at a distance 2.90 ˚A indicating t3 hopping will be stronger in comparison to t1 .
The bond angle of Cu1-O2-Cu2 corresponding to the t3 hopping is 118.06◦, while the bond angle of Cu1-O1-Cu2 is 93◦for the t1 hopping path.
The strength of antiferromagnetic interactions are strongly dependent on the angle between the bonds.
When the angle is close to 90◦, the AF super-exchange process is suppressed due to the orthogonality of Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals.
So the exchange coupling along the path t1 is expected to be ferromagnetic.
For t4 hopping, two Cu1 octahedra are corner-shared with each other and the bond-angle of Cu1-O3-Cu1 is 107◦while for the t2 hopping path, the two Cu1 octahedra share an edge with each other and the bond angle of Cu1-O2-Cu1 is 105◦.
As argued earlier, the t4 hopping dominates over the t2 hopping path due to the corner sharing topology of the Cu1 octahedra.
The second strongest hopping is t7 between the Cu2 atoms.
This Cu2-Cu2 hopping primarily proceeds via the oxygens.
As a result, the strength 9of the Cu-O4-O4-Cu spin exchange is primarily governed by the O-O distance and in this case O-O distance is 2.57 ˚A (smaller than the van der Waals distance).
Moreover, the bond-angle of Cu-O4-O4 is about 167o, which makes this hopping stronger than some of the nn hoppings (t2, t3, and t4).
The hopping paths perpendicular to the Kagome plane are listed in Table V.
Since the distances between the Cu ions in two diﬀerent Kagome plane is small, it is expected that there is substantial amount of hoppings between the Kagome planes.
The strongest interaction between the Kagome plane is ti 2.
This interaction is mediated via Te following the path Cu-O-Te-O-Cu.
Our electronic structure calculations reveal that intra-kagome and inter-kagome exchange inter- actions are long ranged.
In general, an ideal 2D Kagome system with only uniform nn couplings does not order even at zero−T. However, spin wave theory16 predicts that the presence of 2nd nn (Jnnn) and 3rd nn (Jdiagonal) couplings in the Kagome plane can drive the system to an ordered ground state.
When Jdiagonal > Jnnn, √ 3 × √ 3 N´eel ordered state is favored, while the q = 0 N´eel state occurs in the case of Jnnn > Jdiagonal.
A rich theoretical magnetic phase diagram has also been built based on the type (antiferro and ferromagnetic) and the relative strength (Jnnn/Jdiagonal) of interactions in the 2D Kagome system.9,17 Since the Kagome plane of PbCu3TeO7 appear to have additional couplings (2nd and 3rd nn), they might support ordered magnetic states as mentioned above.
In addition, there are also substantial inter-planar couplings found in this system.
These additional intra-Kagome and inter-Kagome couplings might be the reason to have diﬀerent AF transitions in this system.
A detailed neutron diﬀraction measurements and analysis will however be needed to clarify the origin and nature of these transitions. IV.
CONCLUSIONS Based on the structural details, one forms the impression that PbCu3TeO7 might have quasi-2D staircase (buckled) Kagome layers.
However, our magnetic measurements on polycrystalline and single crystal samples show the onset of LRO at about 36 K with a change in the spin-order around 25 K. This indicates the existence of signiﬁcant three-dimensional couplings.
The χ(T) is found to obey the simple Curie-Weiss law above 200 K with a Curie constant as expected for a paramagnetic system.
However, below 200 K there is a deviation from the Curie-Weiss behavior though it is well above TN, which suggests the presence of frustrated spin correlations well above TN.
This behavior is also consistent with Cp(T) which infers the presence of magnetic entropy well above the magnetic transitions.
We performed electronic structure calculations to determine the relative values and 10importance of various exchange paths.
Our results suggest the presence of various intra-Kagome (nnn and diagonal) and inter-Kagome exchange hopping paths, which then must be responsible for the onset of LRO in this system.
Detailed neutron diﬀraction measurements will be helpful to understand more about the nature of spin orderings and magnetic phase diagram of this system.

Figures and captions: Fig. 1 (a) The crystal structure of PbCu3TeO7 viewed along the b−direction is shown.
(b) Projection of staircase (buckled) Kagome planes in the bc−plane formed by Cu and O atoms with various bond-angles18.
The possible nearest neighbor (nn) exchange couplings between Cu1 and Cu2 atoms in the Kagome layer are denoted by J1, J2, J3,and J4.
The environments of the Cu1 octahedron, the Cu2 tetrahedron and their coupling are shown in (c), (d), and (e).
LDA calculations suggest various hopping paths for (f) intra-Kagome plane and (g) inter-Kagome planes indicated by tn, and ti n, respectively.
(color online) Fig. 2 (a) Powder x-ray diﬀraction pattern of PbCu3TeO7 at room temperature.
The open circles indicate the experimental data, while the calculated XRD with residual factors of Rp ≈0.1, Rwp ≈0.12, and χ2 ≈4 is shown as a solid red line.
The Bragg peak positions are indicated by short-vertical marks and the bottom green line represents the diﬀerence between the experimental and calculated data.
(b) The x-ray diﬀraction pattern when the x-rays are incident at the ”top” surface of the crystal in the horizontal plane (the incident and the diﬀracted beam form the vertical plane).
The crystallographic axes as determined from Laue diﬀraction are also illustrated.
(color online) Fig. 3 (a) Magnetic susceptibilities (χ) of a polycrystalline and a single crystal sample are plotted as a function of T. The inset shows an expanded view of the low-temperature data.
(b) (χ−χ0)−1 is plotted as a function of T. The data are ﬁtted to the Curie-Weiss law in the T−range 200 K - 370 K. (color online) Fig. 4 Magnetic susceptibility of PbCu3TeO7 in the orientation of H ∥a for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds (a) 1 kOe, (b) 5 kOe, (c) 10 kOe and (d) 15 kOe is plotted.
The black solid line indicates zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) warming data, while the red and blue solid lines are the data related to ﬁeld-cooled (FC) cooling and FC warming, respectively.
The red and black arrow marks indicate the position of magnetic anomaly in the cooling and warming data, respectively.
(color online) Fig. 5 The Cp data (open circles) are plotted as a function of T. The red solid line is a ﬁt to the equation (see text) in the T−range from 150 K to 280 K and the red dashed line is the extrapolation of the ﬁt.
Inset shows magnetic heat capacity (left y−axis) and entropy (right y−axis) versus T. (color online) 13Fig. 6 Downfolded band structure (shown in red line) compared to the full orbital band structure (shown in black line) for PbCu3TeO7.
