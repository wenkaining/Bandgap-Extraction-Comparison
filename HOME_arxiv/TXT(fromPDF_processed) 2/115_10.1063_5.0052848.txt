Dielectric function spectra measured on high quality, marginally electrically conductive melt grown single bulk crys- tals are obtained on a wavelength-by-wavelength (a.k.a. point-by-point) basis and by numerical reduction of a subtle free charge carrier Drude model contribution.
A four-parameter semi-quantum model is applied to determine all six- teen pairs of infrared-active transverse and longitudinal optical phonon modes, including the high-frequency dielectric constant, ε∞= 4.05 ± 0.05.
The Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation then gives access to the static dielectric constant, εDC = 10.55 ± 0.07.
All experimental results are in excellent agreement with our density functional theory calcu- lations and with previously reported values, where existent.
We also perform optical Hall effect measurements and determine for the unintentionally doped n-type sample a free electron density of n = (2.81 ± 0.01) × 1017 cm−3, mobility of µ = (112 ± 3) cm2/(Vs), and an effective mass parameter of (0.208 ± 0.006)me.
Density and mobil- ity parameters compare very well with results of electrical Hall effect measurements.
Our effective mass parameter, which is measured independently of any other experimental technique, represents the bottom curvature of the Γ point in In2O3 in agreement with previous extrapolations.
We use terahertz spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the quasi- static response of In2O3, and our model validates the static dielectric constant obtained from the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation.
I. INTRODUCTION Indium oxide (In2O3) is a sesquioxide of continued interest as a part of the broader transparent semiconducting oxide fam- ily.
In2O3 crystallizes in a stable phase with bixbyite structure and cubic crystal symmetry.
Similarly to other transparent semiconducting oxides, In2O3 is classiﬁed as a wide bandgap (2.9 eV) material.1 When doped with tin, In2O3 shows high electrical conductivity.2–4 These properties lend In2O3 to applications in transparent electrodes,5–8 gas sensing,9–11 nanowire technology,12 high-voltage transistors,13–15 Schottky diodes,16,17 and ultra-violet light emitting devices,18–21 for ex- ample.
In2O3 with high structural quality has been produced by thin ﬁlm and bulk growth methods.
Most existing works study thin ﬁlm samples and as a result, most of the applications are designed around thin ﬁlm samples as well.22 Bierwagen and Speck reported high quality thin ﬁlms grown by plasma- assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE);4,23 Yang et al. re- ported similarly high quality thin ﬁlms grown by metal or- ganic vapor phase epitaxy;24 and Karim, Feng, and Zhao re- ported high quality thin ﬁlms grown by low pressure chem- ical vapor deposition,25 for example.
Recently, Galazka et al. developed a high quality single crystal bulk growth method, and thereby provided substrates with large surface areas for epitaxy.26 The structural quality of epitaxial layers a)Electronic mail: mstokey@huskers.unl.edu; http://ellipsometry.unl.edu grown, e.g., by PAMBE, is typically higher than for polycrys- talline ﬁlms and lower than or comparable to bulk crystals.
With increasing availability of bulk samples, the possibilities for homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial growth are becoming abundant.27,28 In2O3 is commonly n type and unintentionally doped (UID).
High quality thin ﬁlms and bulk crystals, UID and doped with tin, were investigated recently by Feneberg et al.29 The free electron density varied from 3.7 × 1017 −1.2 × 1021 cm−3 and can be well controlled.
Electrically insulating high quality single crystalline In2O3 has not yet been reported.
The effective conduction band mass parameter in In2O3 has been widely studied.
Reported effective mass values range from 0.13-0.55 m0 (m0 is the free electron mass),29–32 with rather large spread among results from experimental and the- oretical investigations.
Experimental results were reported from combined electrical Hall effect and Seebeck effect measurements,30–32 combined electrical Hall effect and in- frared ellipsometry measurements,29 and angle resolved pho- toemission measurements.33,34 Many reports of conduction band mass parameters exist which were obtained from ﬁrst principle calculations in various approximations.35–39 Perhaps the most accurate theory result was provided by Fuchs and Bechstedt37 using ﬁrst principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations with nonlocal potential resulting from a HSE03 hybrid functional and quasi-particle correction.
For the bcc polymorph, the effective electron mass at the Γ point is almost direction independent and amounts to 0.22 me using the HSE03 functional.37 The conduction band is nonparabolic, with smaller nonparabolicity than in InN but remains non-2 negligible.40 Fuchs and Bechstedt gave an approximation for the conduction band EC (k) = 1 2  Eg + r E2g + 4 me m⋆−1  EkEg  , (1) where Ek = (ℏ2/2me)k2 and the direct bandgap energy Eg is obtained from kp calculations.
The nonparabolicity of the effective mass, i.e., its k dependence, can be determined by matching calculated band structure data against Eq. 1, which permits one to obtain m⋆(k) when considering that the inverse of the second derivative of the left side in Eq. 1 is related to the k-dependent effective mass parameter m⋆(k) me =  1 + me/m⋆−1 1 + 4(me/m⋆−1)EkEg −1 , (2) where m⋆denotes the effective mass at Γ.37 According to Fuchs and Bechstedt37 the effective mass raises to ap- proximately 0.3 me for free electron densities exceeding 1020 cm−3 in agreement with experimental investigations.
Feneberg et al. used a method combining infrared ellip- sometry and electrical Hall effect measurements, introduced by Kasic et al.41 for GaN thin ﬁlms, and reported effective mass parameters for n type In2O3 bulk samples and epitax- ial thin ﬁlms with free electron densities ranging from 5 × 1018 . . .
1021cm−3.29 A strong variation of the effective mass parameter was observed with carrier density, from 0.18 me for the lowest detectable carrier density to approximately 0.44 me at 1021cm−3, and explained by near Γ point conduction band nonparabolicity.
A similar conduction band nonparabolicity was observed previously for wurtzite structure InN, where the effective mass varies from 0.05 me for perpendicular polariza- tion and 0.037 me for parallel polarization at the band bottom to 0.15 me for both polarization directions when approaching free electron densities of 1020cm−3.40 A simpliﬁed approxi- mation for the free electron density n dependence of the con- duction band mass m⋆was reported by Feneberg et al. m⋆(n) = q m⋆2(0) + 2Cℏ2m⋆(0)(3π2n) 2 3 , (3) and matching experimental data resulted in the zero density effective mass parameter m⋆(0) = (0.18±0.02) m0 and non- parabolocity parameter C = 0.5 ± 0.02 eV−1.
The zero den- sity effective mass value extrapolated using Eq. 3 is in very good agreement with the Γ point effective mass from HSE03 results in Fuchs and Bechstedt.
The electrical mobility decreases with increasing carrier concentration due to impurity scattering and electron-electron interactions.
In2O3 single crystals grown from melt have been studied systematically using different heat treatments at temperatures from 200◦C to 1400◦C.42 Annealing under non-reducing conditions lead to free electron densities in the 1017 cm−3 range.
Typical electron mobility parameters were reported between 140-180 cm2/(Vs).
Such annealed sam- ples revealed transmittance spectra with sharp absorption edge at 440 nm wavelength with high transparency in the visible range.42 A new crystal growth technique, “Levitation-Assisted Self-Seeding Crystal Growth Method” with subsequent an- nealing in O2-containing atmosphere resulted in improved electron mobility of 190 cm2/(Vs) in the low 1017 cm−3 free electron density range.43 Comparison between mobility ob- tained from electrical Hall effect measurements and broaden- ing parameter showed very good agreement between free elec- tron mobility determined by infrared ellipsometry and electri- cal Hall effect measurements.
It is noted that in this com- parison performed by Feneberg et al.,29 electrical mobility is obtained by the same measurement which determines the elec- tron density, and which in turn was used there to determine the effective mass. In2O3 is known to develop a surface charge accumulation similarly to indium nitride.44–46 It has been posed that this is caused by oxygen vacancies.47 Additionally, Scherer et al. showed that bulk In2O3 crystals cleaved in ultra-high vacuum did not show any electron accumulation layer.48 While this effect is necessary for applications in gas sensing, it hinders performance of transistor and diode technologies and must be controlled.
An early vibrational study by White and Keramidas of in- frared and Raman spectra from powder In2O3 revealed lim- ited sets of mode parameters.
Only 11 out of the 16 transverse optical (TO) mode frequencies and none of the longitudinal optical (LO) mode frequencies were reported.49 Hamberg and Granqvist, in a large study of sets of indium oxide thin ﬁlms obtained by evaporation, reported on similar subsets of data.50 Analysis of reﬂectance measured on pellet samples by So- batta et al. added the LO mode parameters for the 11 TO mode parameters identiﬁed earlier.51 More recently, thin-ﬁlm sam- ples have been studied and a complete set of Raman modes have been described.52,53 Infrared ellipsometry was used by Feneberg et al. on a large set of samples in the spectral range above 300 cm−1.
Highly accurate TO mode frequencies for a subset of 8 modes from the 11 modes already characterized by Sobatta et al. and White and Keramidas were reported.
The LO mode parameters were not determined and the focus was directed to determine Drude model parameters for the differ- ently doped samples in order to determine the density depen- dence of the effective mass parameters.
Phonon mode parameters obtained from ﬁrst principles cal- culations are not available in the literature.
Hamberg and Granqvist determined the static dielectric constant (εDC ≈8.9 −9.5) and the high frequency dielec- tric constant (ε∞= 4) from analysis of broadband reﬂec- tion and transmission data obtained from polycrystalline thin ﬁlms deposited by e-beam evaporation.50 No other experi- mental results for the static dielectric constant appears to be available.
Typical capacitance measurement conﬁgurations for radio frequency determination of the static dielectric con- stant require highly insulating material which has not been grown yet.
Therefore, capacitance measurements, e.g., as re- ported for insulating β-Ga2O3 are not available for In2O3.54 Zhang et al. obtained εDC = 9.05 from DFT calculations.34 Walsh et al. determined εDC = 9.0 using interatomic poten- tial calculations.55 The high frequency dielectric constant is mostly agreed upon both by experiment (e.g., Feneberg et al.: 4.08 ± 0.02)29 and theory (e.g., Fuchs and Bechstedt: 4.0).37 With the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relationship,56 εDC = ε∞ N Y l=1 ω2 LO,l ω2 TO,l , (4) and knowledge of all infrared active transverse (TO; ωTO) and longitudinal optical (LO; ωTO) phonon modes and accurate value of ε∞, εDC can be determined.
However, as discussed above only 11 out of the N = 16 phonon mode pairs, ωTO,l and ωLO,l, are known so far, while for l = 12, . . .

experimental nor theoretical results seem to exist.
In this work, we report a combined terahertz, far-infrared, and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry, optical Hall effect, and density functional theory investigation.
We perform and analyze measurements on a high quality, unintention- ally doped, marginally electrically conductive single crys- tal of cubic In2O3.
We obtain and report the static dielec- tric constant, the optical phonons, and the free charge carrier properties.
We observe and determine all remaining TO and LO phonon mode parameters from our ellipsometry measure- ments.
We also report the complete set of zone center op- tical phonon modes from our theoretical investigation.
We report the static dielectric constant from the full set of opti- cal phonon modes and the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation.
We further demonstrate excellent agreement with our LST extrap- olation by comparing model-calculated with measured THz ellipsometry measurements.
Our optical Hall effect measure- ments reveal density, n, mobility, µ, and effective mass pa- rameters which determine an independently measured exper- imental value closest to the zero density effective mass pa- rameter, m⋆(0).
We compare our results where available with previous reports, and we compare and discuss our optical Hall effect with electrical Hall effect results. II.
THEORY A. Crystal Structure and Symmetry In2O3 crystallizes in the cubic bixbyte structure (space group No. 206, Ia¯3).
The primitive cell contains 40 atoms, which results in the total of 117 optical phonon modes, which at the Brillouin-zone center belong to the irreducible repre- sentation: Γopt = 4Ag + 5Au + 4Eg + 5Eu + 14Tg + 16Tu.
E and T modes are double- and triple-degenerate, respec- tively.
Modes Ag, Eg, and Tg (g - gerade) are Raman-active; modes Tu are IR-active (and the focus of the present study); and modes Au and Eu (u - ungerade) are silent.
B. Density Functional Theory DFT calculations were performed by a plane wave DFT code Quantum ESPRESSO (QE).57 We used the local density approximation exchange-correlationfunctional of Perdew and Wang (PW)58,59 and optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials.60 As the start- ing point, we used structural parameters from the Materi- als Project.61,62 [doi: 10.17188/1198812] The initial structure was ﬁrst relaxed to force levels less than 10−6 Ry Bohr−1.
A regular shifted 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack grid was used for sampling of the Brillouin zone.63 A convergence thresh- old of 1 × 10−12 Ry was used to reach self-consistency with the electronic wavefunction cutoff of 120 Ry.
The relaxed cell was used for subsequent phonon calculations.
The phonon frequencies, Born effective charges, and IR intensities were computed at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone using density functional perturbation theory,64 as implemented in the Quan- tum ESPRESSO package, with the convergence threshold for self-consistency of 1 × 10−18 Ry.
The parameters of the TO modes were obtained from the dynamical matrix computed at the Γ-point.
The parameters of the LO modes were ob- tained by setting a small displacement from the Γ-point in or- der to include the long-range Coulomb interactions of Born effective charges in the dynamical matrix (the so called non- analytical terms).
Mode displacement patterns were rendered using XCrysDen65 running under Silicon Graphics Irix 6.5.
C. Spectroscopic Ellipsometry Spectroscopic ellipsometry is a non-invasive and non- destructive measurement technique which measures the change in polarization of light (˜ρ) caused by interaction with the sample.
In reﬂection ellipsometry this change is described by ˜ρ = ˜rp ˜rs = tan(Ψ)ei∆, (5) where ˜rp and ˜rs are the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients for the light polarized parallel (p) to and perpendicular (s) to the plane of incidence.
The rotation of the light’s polarization state about the axis of propagation is deﬁned as Ψ and the rela- tive phase shift between the parallel and perpendicular com- ponents is deﬁned as ∆. Hence, for each wavenumber, angle of incidence, and sample position a (Ψ, ∆) pair is measured.
D. Four-Parameter Semi-Quantum Model To ﬁt for the parameters describing each phonon mode found in the dielectric function, the four-parameter semi- quantum (FPSQ) model ﬁrst described by Gervais and Periou can be used.66,67 This model allows one to ﬁt directly for TO and LO mode frequencies, ωTO,l and ωLO,l, and the determi- nation of their independent broadening parameters, γTO,l and4 γLO,l, respectively ε = ε∞ N Y l=1 ω2 LO,l −ω2 −iωγLO,l ω2 TO,l −ω2 −iωγTO,l , (6) and ε∞is the high-frequency dielectric constant.67 The prod- uct runs over all N = 16 phonons (TO-LO pairs) with Tu symmetry.
The Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation56 in Eq. 4 then permits calculation of the static dielectric constant, using all other parameters in Eq. 6 determined from analysis of the wavenumber-by-wavenumber obtained ε.
E. Drude Free Charge Carrier Model The FPSQ model is further modiﬁed to account for free charge carrier contributions via the addition of a Drude term:67 εFC = − ω2 p ω(ω + iγp), (7) where ωp is the plasma frequency ω2 p = −e2n ε∞ε0m⋆, (8) and where n, m⋆, and γp describe the free charge carrier vol- ume density, the effective mass, and the plasma broadening parameter, respectively.
From the plasma broadening param- eter, the optical mobility parameter, µ, can be found via: γp = e m⋆µ. (9) F. Optical Hall Effect The optical Hall effect experiment and analysis procedure is summarized by Schubert et al.68 Derived from the equation of motion, the dielectric function component for free charge carriers under the effect of an external magnetic ﬁeld can be written as follows: ε(ω) = ω2 p  −ω2I −iωγ + iω   0 b3 −b2 −b3 0 b1 b2 −b1 0  ωc   −1 .
(10) Here, ωc is the cyclotron frequency ωc = qB m⋆. (11) Note that the signature of ωc depends on the type of the free charge carriers and hence, the signs of the optical Hall effect data reveal n or p type conductivity.68 The external magnetic ﬁeld is given in the ellipsometer coordinate system (x,y,z) as B = B(b1, b2, b3) where B = |B|.
The optical Hall effect ex- periment gives access to the cyclotron frequency, therefore, if plasma frequency and broadening parameters are known from zero-ﬁeld ellipsometry measurements, Ns, m⋆, and µ can all be determined independently from each other, and without use of an additional separate experiment, e.g., an electrical Hall effect measurement.
One further has the opportunity to com- pare density and mobility parameters obtained from optical and electrical techniques.
It is noteworthy to point out the very different mechanisms of transport which are tested in an optical and in an electrical measurement.
For a traditional electrical Hall conﬁguration, for example, transport and scat- tering phenomena are collected over macroscopic distances across the sample; while for optical measurements, the lat- eral displacement of the free charge carriers is on the order of nanometers.
In an ideal crystal without defects, both tech- niques will determine very similar if not the same results.
In these optical Hall effect experiments, the ellipsometry data are recorded using the Mueller matrix convention as op- posed to the Ψ and ∆convention for the zero magnetic ﬁeld measurements.
The Mueller matrix formalism allows accurate capture of the small optical birefringence induced by the op- tical Hall effect which are then observable in the off-diagonal Mueller matrix elements.
The Mueller matrix is used to de- scribe the sample interaction with incoming light described by a Stokes vector as follows:    S0 S1 S2 S3    output =    M11 M12 M13 M14 M21 M22 M23 M24 M31 M32 M33 M34 M41 M42 M43 M44       S0 S1 S2 S3    input .
(12) Here, the elements of the Stokes vector are deﬁned as S0 = Ip + Is, S1 = Ip −Is, S2 = I45 −I−45, S3 = Iσ+ − Iσ−.
In this deﬁnition, Ip, Is, I45, I−45, Iσ+, and Iσ−are the intensities for the p-, s-, +45◦, -45◦, right handed, and left handed circularly polarized light components, respectively.69 III.
EXPERIMENT A. Crystal Growth The investigated crystal sample was prepared from a bulk crystal grown from the melt by a novel technique ”Levitation- Assisted Self-Seeding Crystal Growth Method,” as described in detail elsewhere.26 The free electron concentration was determined from electrical Hall measurements to be 2.65 × 10−17 cm−3, and the Hall electrical mobility is 158 cm2/(Vs) (resistivity 0.15 Ωcm) The crystal with surface area of 10 × 10 mm2 and thickness of 500 µm with (111) surface orienta- tion was annealed in air at temperatures of 1000◦C for 40 h. Processes for annealing and control of electron density have been reported previously.26 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the rocking curves of (222) reﬂexes was ≈30 arc sec.
The investigated crystal samples were epi-ready polished.
The sample was then investigated by ellipsometry and optical Hall effect without further treatment.
B. Far-infrared and Infrared Ellipsometry The spectra were measured at room temperature in ambi- ent conditions on two different ellipsometer instruments.
The infrared spectral range (650 - 3000 cm−1) was measured on a commercial variable angle of incidence spectroscopic ellip- someter (IR-VASE Mark-II; J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.).
The far- infrared spectral range (50 - 650 cm−1) was measured on an in-house built FIR-VASE instrument.70 Measurements were performed at Φa = 50◦, 60◦, and 70◦angles of incidence.
Multiple azimuthal rotations were not necessary, though they5 were performed to ensure the cubic symmetry of the optical response.
Only one azimuthal rotation is included in this anal- ysis since all rotational data are in excellent agreement with each other.
Exemplary experimental data in the FIR range is shown in Fig. 7. C. Optical Hall Effect Experiment The same sample was then mounted in our in-house opti- cal Hall effect setup as described by K¨uhne et al.70 Due to the window setup of the superconducting magnet, the angle of incidence is limited to only Φa= 45◦.
The optical Hall ef- fect was measured in the far-infrared and in the infrared range.
Measurements were taken at zero ﬁeld, at B = +7 T, and at B = −7 T with the sample maintained at room temperature throughout the measurements.
The magnetic ﬁeld was ori- ented parallel to the incoming beam with the magnetic ﬁeld strength B⊥= B/ √ 2 perpendicular to the sample surface for all measurements.
D. Terahertz Ellipsometry To further investigate the dielectric constants and free charge carrier contributions at quasi-static conditions, el- lipsometry was measured in the THz spectrum from 670- 900 GHz.
The THz ellipsometer is an in-house built instru- ment operating in the rotating analyzer conﬁguration allowing the measurement of the upper left 3 × 3 Mueller matrix ele- ments.
Further information on the instrument can be found in K¨uhne et al.70 Data from this instrument is shown in Fig. 10. IV.
RESULTS A. Density Functional Theory Calculations The parameters of the DFT-calculated TO and LO phonon modes are listed in Table I and labelled by Tu −i, i = 1, . . . 16.
Renderings of the atomic displacement pattern for the TO modes are shown in Fig. 2 (modes Tu-1 to Tu-4), Fig. 3 (Tu-5 to Tu-8), Fig. 4 (Tu-9 to Tu-12), and Fig. 5 (Tu- 13 to Tu-16).
Because every Tu mode is triple degenerate, three eigenvectors with labels a, b, and c are shown for every phonon mode.
The corresponding transition dipoles for each such triplet are mutually orthogonal.
We note that we observe 16 mode pairs as predicted by group theory.
We also note that the intensities of the TO and LO modes are very small for modes 13-16 which may explain why these modes remain undetected thus far.
B. Phonon Mode Analysis from Ellipsometry Data To perform this analysis, WVASE32TM (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) software was utilized.
We assume no ﬁnite nanometer- scale surface roughness as such roughness does not contribute to the ellipsometric data in the infrared and far-infrared spec- tral regions.67 It is worth noting here that if a surface accumu- lation layer had been present on this sample, it was not observ- able in optical Hall effect measurements nor in our zero ﬁeld spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements.

done using a wavenumber-by-wavenumber approach where a model dielectric function is allowed to ﬁt for each wavenum- ber independently to ﬁnd a best-match model of the real and imaginary dielectric values.
In a subtle modiﬁcation to this approach, we also added a free charge carrier contribution to the model dielectric function, according to Eq. 7.
This step is performed to reduce the otherwise small increase in the imag- inary part of ε towards the far-infrared spectral range, which is caused by the absorption of the low density free electrons present in our sample.

Vertical blue solid lines indicate TO modes, and blue dashed lines indicate LO modes identiﬁed in this work.
Note that the zero- valued off-diagonal elements of the Mueller matrix are excluded as well as elements M21 and M22 as they show no additional informa- tion.
eters will be discussed further below.
The resulting dielec- tric function with added free charge carrier contributions lead to the therefrom calculated Mueller matrix data which excel- lently match with the experimental data in Fig. 6.
Selected ex- perimental and best-model calculated data in the far-infrared spectral region emphasizing small yet distinct signatures of phonon modes unidentiﬁed previously in the long wavelength range are shown in Fig. 7. Figure 8 summarizes the wavenumber-by-wavenumber best-model parameter ε(ω) and Fig. 9 emphasises the far- infrared spectral region.

Implementing sixteen TO-LO pair parameters and ε∞we were able to ﬁnd excellent agreement between the best-match model and the wavenumber-by-wavenumberproduced dielec- tric function, as shown in Fig. 8.
Note that we present the imaginary parts of ε and ε−1 since these immediately reveal frequency and broadening of the TO and LO mode parame- ters, as one can assess from Eq. 6.
We note further that small additional features in the far-infrared range, Fig. 9, are most likely due to noise increasing rapidly for wavenumbers below 100 cm−1 towards the THz range, best seen in Fig. 7.
This noise is due to the loss of detected intensity in the far-infrared probe beam.
All best-match model parameters and uncertain- ties are summarized in Table II.
We identify all mode pairs predicted by our DFT calculations and their broadening pa- rameters.
We note that the generalized Lowndes condition is fulﬁlled, where the sum of all LO broadening parameters is larger or equal to the sum of all TO broadening parameters.41 While several modes are small in the lower spectral range, they remain detectable and were able to be ﬁt for with lim- ited interference.
All modes are indicated in Fig. 8.
Values which were range limited are designated in Table II with an asterisk and as a result have very large uncertainty.
This can be attributed to the small magnitude of the modes (seen in the DFT analysis as well) and growing noise in the lower spectral range.
Also shown in Table II are previously reported TO phonon frequencies as found by Feneberg et al.29 and TO and LO mode frequencies as observed by Sobotta et al.51 Our val- ues are in excellent agreement with the eight TO modes deter- mined by Feneberg et al., except for the small mode Tu −4, which was not observed there.
Also, Feneberg et al. did not determine any LO mode parameters, and modes below 300 cm−1remained inaccessible.
The phonon modes reported by Sobotta et al. is the most comprehensive data set to date, and is in reasonable agreement with our results, except for the lack of the far-infrared modes.
We note that speciﬁcally LO modes are inherently difﬁcult to obtain from reﬂectance data of pellets and low quality samples which may explain some of the discrepancies between data of Sobotta et al. and our results.
Modes 12-16 remained unobserved previously and can only be compared against our own DFT calculations.

C. Free Electron Parameters The free electron parameters were characterized via opti- cal Hall effect measurements and compared to electrical Hall effect results.
Data are shown in Fig. 11.
We note that for analysis of the optical Hall effect data only one more param- eter is needed, ωc.
The other two parameters, ωp and γp, are already determined during the phonon mode analysis step by matching the zero ﬁeld ellipsometry parameters to the best- model dielectric function.
As discussed previously,68 the op- tical Hall effect signatures are proportional to ωc, and hence, combining zero ﬁeld measurements with optical Hall effect measurements provides the third parameter from experiment.
This then leads to determination of n, µ and m⋆.
Here we ﬁnd n = (2.81 ± 0.01) × 1017 cm−3 in excellent agreement with the electrical Hall effect density of n = 2.65 × 1017) cm−3.
These values are also in agreement with those reported by Galazka on similar samples in 2014.43 Due to this relatively8 TABLE II.

Nonetheless, our best-match model pro- vides a consistent ﬁt.
We also obtain the effective mass m⋆= (0.208 ± 0.006) m0 which is very similar to the zero density value, m⋆(0) = 0.18 m0 reported by Feneberg et al.29 This value was obtained from matching a nonparabolic band approximation model for the effective mass parameter to a set of samples from which effective mass and free electron den- sity parameters were determined.
This data set and best-match function m⋆(n) is reproduced in Fig. 12, where our result is included.
The effective mass measured in our work by opti- cal Hall effect corresponds to one order of magnitude lower electron density than reached by Feneberg et al., and is thus closer to the zero density value.
Within our error bar, our value matches excellently with the zero density effective mass extrapolated previously.
We also ﬁnd the free electron mobil- ity, µ = (112 ± 3) cm2/(Vs) from optical Hall effect which is slightly lower than the value of 158 cm2/(Vs) obtained from electrical Hall effect, which is also within the range reported by Galazka, Uecker, and Fornari on similar oxygen annealed samples (130 −190 cm2/(Vs)).43 D. Static and high frequency dielectric constants In order to determine the high frequency dielectric con- stant, we extended the spectral range for our wavelength- by-wavelength analysis far above the phonon mode range, to 3000 cm−1.
At frequencies far above the phonon modes yet far enough below the onset of excitonic and band-to-band transitions so that dispersion introduced by the latter is negli- gible, a good approximation for ε∞can be found.
Our analy- sis resulted in 4.05 ± 0.05.
This is in good agreement with our DFT predicted value (4.128) as well as the value previously reported by Feneberg et al. (4.08).29 Using the LST relation- ship, the static dielectric constant, εDC, can then be calculated since we have determined the complete set of phonon modes.
With the values listed in Table II we obtain here 10.55 ± 0.07.
This value is in agreement with our DFT value of 10.74.
We further conducted ellipsometry measurements at THz frequen- cies in order to directly evaluate the static dielectric permittiv- ity parameters.
While the free carrier concentration is small (the smallest for which effective mass parameters have been reported so far), due to the rather thick sample, our sample is opaque in the THz range.
Hence, THz measurements can only be made in reﬂection and no substrate interferences can be detected.
Such Fabry-Perot interference fringes increase sensitivity to the quasi-static DC permittivity, as demonstrated recently for β-Ga2O3.71 Figure 10 depicts measured and best- model calculated THz Mueller matrix data measured at 50◦ angle of incidence.
The best-model calculated data were obtained without further parameter variations only using the static dielectric constant and the Drude model in Eq. 7 contri- butions with the parameters for n, µ, and m⋆from optical Hall effect as discussed above.
The very good agreement between measured and model-calculated THz Mueller matrix data is indicative of the correctness of the static DC permittivity for In2O3, which has not been determined from experiment at DC or quasi-static frequencies previously.
V. CONCLUSIONS By using a combined approach of spectroscopic ellipsom- etry, DFT calculations, and optical Hall effect measurements we are able to provide a thorough investigation of the elec- trical and optical phonon mode properties of In2O3.
All six- teen TO-LO pairs have been identiﬁed and their respective broadening parameters quantiﬁed.
These values ﬁnd excel- lent agreement with the limited sets of phonon mode informa- tion previously reported, and we introduce phonons in the far- infrared spectrum not detected thus far.
Also our measured phonon modes are in excellent agreement with the results of our DFT calculations.
Furthermore, by means of optical Hall effect measurements, we determine the effective electron mass at the lowest yet detected free electron density, which is in excellent agreement with the zero density effective electron mass in In2O3 predicted previously from extrapolation.9            :DYHQXPEHUFP     E D ,P^İ` ,P^İ`             FIG. 9.
