(Dated: September 18, 2021) We explore universal behaviors of magnetic domain wall driven by the spin-transfer of an electrical current, in a ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)(As,P) thin ﬁlm with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
For a current direction transverse to domain wall, the dynamics of the thermally activated creep regime and the depinning transition are found to be compatible with a self-consistent universal description of magnetic ﬁeld induced domain wall dynamics.
This common universal behavior, characteristic of the so-called quenched Edwards-Wilkinson universality class, is conﬁrmed by a complementary and independent analysis of domain wall roughness.
However, the tilting of domain walls and the formation of facets is produced by the directionality of interaction with the current, which acts as a magnetic ﬁeld only in the direction transverse to domain wall.
PACS numbers: 75.78.Fg, 68.35.Rh, 64.60.Ht, 05.70.Ln, 47.54.-r The displacement of small spin texture as magnetic domain walls (DWs) thanks to spin torque eﬀects is at the basis of potential applications to magnetic memory storage [1].
An important eﬀort is dedicated to search for magnetic materials [2, 3] with large and well controlled DW velocities.
However, DWs are very sensitive to weak pinning defects [4, 5], which strongly reduce their mobil- ity and produce roughening and stochastic avalanche-like motion [6, 7].
Therefore, it is particularly interesting to better understand the contribution of pinning to current induced DW dynamics.
Magnetic domain walls [4–12] present surprising uni- versal critical behaviors, encountered in a wide variety of moving interfaces such as the reaction front propagation in disordered ﬂows [13], growing bacterial colonies [14], wetting [15], motion of ferroelectric domain walls [16], to name a few.
The interfaces are rough with self-aﬃne width growing as Lζ, where L the distance between two points of the interface and ζ the roughness exponent.
Moreover, a depinning driving force fd separates the so- called creep (f < fd) and depinning (f >∼fd) regimes.
In the creep regime, the velocity varies as an Arrhenius law v ∼e−∆E/kBT [4, 11, 17], where kBT is the thermal ﬂuctuation energy.
∆E is the eﬀective pinning energy barrier height, which follows a universal power law vari- ation with the driving force ∆E ∼f −µ, where µ is the creep exponent.
In the depinning regime [12, 18, 19], the eﬀective pinning barriers are collapsed.
The velocity presents power law variations with drive f and temper- ature T: v ∼(f −fd)β and v(fd) ∼T ψ, where β and ψ are the depinning and thermal rounding exponents, respectively.
Universal behaviors have been extensively investigated for DWs driven by magnetic ﬁeld (f ∝H) in ferromag- netic ultrathin ﬁlms.
For a large variety of materials, the measured values of the creep (µ = 1/4) [4, 9–11] and roughness (ζ ≈0.66 [4, 5, 9] and ζ ≈1.25 [7] ) exponents, are compatible with the prediction for the motion of an elastic 1D line in a short-range weak pinning disorder, described by the so-called quenched Edwards Wilkinson (qEW) universality class with [20], and without [17, 21] anharmonic contributions, respectively.
Moreover, it was recently shown [12] that the depinning transition is com- patible with the predictions for the qEW universality class (β = 0.25 [18], and ψ = 0.15 [19]).
In contrast, the universal behaviors of DW motion in- duced by spin-polarized electric current are more con- tentious.
To the best of our knowledge, the universality of the depinning transition has not yet been explored.
For the creep motion, a compatibility with µ = 1/4 is suggested for DW driven by the conventional spin trans- fer torque (STT) in Pt/Co/Pt nanowires [22] and by spin orbit torque (SOT), in ferrimagnets [2].
However, rather intriguing diﬀerences between current and magnetic ﬁeld driven motion are also reported in the literature.
Dif- ferent values of the creep exponent were reported for other materials (µ = 0.33 ± 0.06 for (Ga,Mn)As [8] and µ = 0.39 ± 0.06 for Ta/CoFeB/MgO [10]), which are dif- ﬁcult to interpret.
The tilting and faceting [5, 23] of DWs, produced by the current could suggest a compat- ibility with the so-called quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) universality class [5].
However, in the direction perpendicular to DW, the roughness is characterized by an exponent (ζj = 0.69±0.04) independent of DW tilting arXiv:1904.03047v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  5 Sep 20192 angle and compatible with the measurement obtained for ﬁeld driven DW motion (ζH = 0.68 ± 0.04), while a dif- ferent value (ζj = 0.99±0.01) is obtained in the direction of current.
Therefore, whether distinct or common uni- versality classes describe the motion of DWs produced by current and magnetic ﬁeld remains an open question.
In this letter, we show that the roughness and universal dy- namics of spin-transfer-torque (STT) driven domain wall are particularly well described within the qEW univer- sality class.
Experimental techniques.
The experiments were performed with rectangles of a 4 nm thick (Ga,Mn)(As,P)/(Ga,Mn)As bilayer ﬁlm patterned by lithography.
The ﬁlm was grown on a (001) GaAs/AlAs buﬀer [24].
It has an eﬀective perpendicular anisotropy and a Curie temperature (Tc) of 65 K. The sizes of rectangles were 133 × 210, 228 × 302, and 323 × 399 µm2 (see supplemental material [25] for the details).
Two 40 µm wide gold electrodes (separated by 110, 204, and 300 µm, respectively) were deposited by evaporation parallel to the narrow sides of rectangles [25].
They were used to generate an homogeneous current density producing DW motion by STT.
The pulse amplitude varied between 0 and 11 GA/m2.
We veriﬁed that the Joule eﬀect had a negligible contribution on DW dynamics [25].
Perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld pulses of adjustable amplitude (0-65 mT) were produced by a 75 turns small coil (diameter ∼1 mm) mounted on the sample.
The set-up was placed in an optical He-ﬂow cryostat allowing to stabilize the temperature between 5.7 K and Tc.
The DW displacement is observed using a magneto-optical Kerr microscope (resolution ∼1 µm).
The DW velocity is deﬁned as the ratio between the average displacement ∆x and the pulse duration ∆t [25], which varies between 1 µs and 120 s. DW dynamics and creep exponent.
Let us start with investigations of current driven DW dynamics.
In or- der to circumvent the variation of driving force with DW tilt, the velocity measurements were all performed from almost ﬂat DWs transverse to current (θ ≈0) (see [25]).
The velocity curves are reported in Fig. 1 and show simi- lar features to those usually encountered in the literature for magnetic ﬁeld driven DW dynamics [9, 11, 12].
At low drive (j < jd), the velocity follows a strong non-linear variation with drive and temperature, which character- izes the thermally activated creep regime (see the inset in Fig. 1).
The curves present a change of curvature below and above the depinning threshold (j = jd).
The lin- ear variation observed well above threshold corresponds to the ﬂow regime.
Here the exploration of DW dynam- ics was limited to the temperature range T = 49-59 K, due to large thermal ﬂuctuations impeding accurate dis- placement measurements above 59 K and to an increase of the depinning threshold beyond experimental access below 49 K. For more quantitative insights on dynamical univer- Figure 1.

For the creep regime, the energy barrier height is given by ∆E = kBTd((j/jd)−µ −1), where kBTd is the char- acteristic height of eﬀective pinning barrier.
For the de- pinning regime, Eq. 1 is only valid over a limited range: it does not account for the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations occurring just above the depinning threshold nor for the crossover to linear ﬂow regime [12].
The depinning ex- ponents are β = 0.25, and ψ = 0.15, and the critical parameter x0 = 0.65 [12].
Finally, the linear ﬂow regime in Eq. 1 is only reached at the end of crossover.
For each temperature, the ﬁt of three regimes described by Eqs. 1 (see Fig. 1) relies only on three independent adjustable parameters (jd(T), v(jd(T)), and Td) and was performed simultaneously.
As the depinning threshold jd is not known a priori, the following procedure was used.
The ﬁt of creep regime was performed between the low- est measured velocity and increasing values of v(j, T) on3 Current Magnetic ﬁeld T jd v(jd) Td Hd v(Hd) Td 49 7.9 (0.6) 4.1 (0.5) 465 (35) 28.4 (0.4) 7.5 (0.4) 320 (15) 54 4.9 (0.4) 3.0 (0.4) 375 (25) 15.5 (0.4) 4.0 (0.2) 420 (20) 59 3.5 (0.3) 2.3 (0.2) 315 (30) 16.1 (0.5) 4.2 (0.4) 410 (20) Table I.

Td(T) was taken as a free parame- ter, and µ = 1/4.
The threshold velocity v(j = jd, T) was assumed to correspond to the best simultaneous ﬁt of Eqs. 1.
As it can be observed in Fig. 1, a good agree- ment is obtained with the data.
The same analysis was performed for magnetic ﬁeld driven DW motion [25].
A comparison of the pinning parameters obtained in both cases is shown in Table I.
The pretty close heights of eﬀec- tive pinning energy barrier (kBTd) reported for each tem- perature indicates that a similar weak pinning disorder controls both dynamics.
In order to estimate precisely the value of creep exponent µ, it was set as a free shared parameter and we perform a global ﬁt of the creep power law lnv ∼j−µ, for j < jd(T), and all the temperatures.
The obtained values for ﬁeld (µH = 0.247 ± 0.011) [25] and current (µj = 0.259 ± 0.004) driven DW motion match within experimental error bars [26].
Therefore, a good agreement is obtained both for the creep exponent and self-consistent description of the creep and depinning universal dynamics.
This is a strong evidence that DW motion induced by transverse current through the STT mechanism shares common universal creep and depin- ning behaviors of DW driven by magnetic ﬁeld observed in thin magnetic ﬁlms made of diﬀerent materials [4, 9– 12, 27]. Roughness exponent.
As this ﬁnding do not conﬁrm the analysis reported in Refs.
[8, 10], we have investi- gated the DW roughness in the creep regime, in order to obtain a complementary and independent test of univer- sal behavior.
The DW self aﬃnity was studied using the displacement-displacement correlation function [4]: w(L) = X x [u(x + L) −u(x)]2, (2) where u(x) is the DW displacement measured parallel to current and L the length of DW segment along the axis x transverse to current (see the inset of Fig. 2 (A)).
For a self-aﬃne interface, the function w(L) is expected to follow a power law variation w(L) ∼L2ζ, where ζ is the roughness exponent.
Typical variations of w(L) versus L obtained for ﬁeld and current induced motion are com- pared in Fig. 2 (B) in log-log scale.
As it can be observed, both curves present a linear variation with similar slopes (= 2ζ), between the microscope resolution (≈1 µm) and L =10 µm.
In order to get more statistics, the slopes Figure 2.

The dashed lines are ﬁt of w ∼L2ζ used to determine the roughness exponents ζj and ζH. were systematically determined for successions of DW positions (see Ref.
[25]) and a temperature varying over one decade (T =4.5-59 K).
The mean and standard devi- ation of the roughness exponent for current (ζj) and ﬁeld (ζH) driven DW motion is reported in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature.
As expected for universal critical expo- nents, the values of ζj and ζH do not vary signiﬁcantly.
Their mean values (ζj = 0.60±0.05 and ζH = 0.61±0.04), calculated from all measurements, agree well within ex- perimental error.
Here, it is important to notice some diﬀerences and similarities with the results reported for Pt/Co/Pt in Ref. 5.
For Ga/Mn/As, ζj presents no signiﬁcant variation with DW tilting (see [25] for details) and remains always signiﬁcantly smaller than the value (ζj = 0.99 ± 0.01) reported for DW displacements mea- sured in the direction of current [28, 29].
In contrast, the value ζj = 0.60 ± 0.05 is compatible with the results (ζj = 0.68±0.04) of Ref. 5 for a DW roughness analyzed in the direction (⃗n) normal to DW.
The good agreement is also obtained with usual experimental results reported in the literature for ﬁeld driven DW motion [4, 5, 9], and4 with theoretical predictions (ζ = 0.635 ± 0.005) [21, 30] for the universality class of the qEW model with short range disorder and elasticity including an-harmonic cor- rection.
Therefore, both the analysis of DW dynamics and roughness lead to the same conclusion of common universal behaviors for current and ﬁeld driven DW mo- tion.
Origin of Domain wall faceting.
This common be- havior, which is a priori diﬃcult to reconcile with the faceting of DW produced by the current calls for investi- gation on the origin of DW faceting.
First, we analyze the evolution of an initially almost rectangular domain sub- jected to a large current density (j = 11GA/m2).
As it can be observed in Fig. 3, the edges of the domain aligned along the current (i.e., ⃗j ⊥⃗n , where ⃗n is the direction normal to DW) remain almost motionless.
In contrast, the back and front DWs perpendicular to the current (i.e., ⃗j ∥⃗n) are signiﬁcantly displaced.
Surprisingly, the back DW moves faster than the front DW, which causes the collapse of the domain (see Fig. 3 (E-F)).
Another interesting feature is the increasingly pointed shape of the front DW (not observed for the back DW).
Here, the faceting of the front DW develops without any contribu- tion of ”strong” pinning sites (see [5, 25]), which suggests that the transverse orientation between DW and current is unstable.
Consequently, the diﬀerent shape evolutions of the front and back DWs observed in Fig. 3 (A-F) can be interpreted as a result of opposite contributions of DW elasticity.
The two side DWs pull the extremities of back (front) DWs in the −⃗j (⃗j) direction, which tends to stabilize (destabilize) the transverse DW orientation.
To explore more quantitatively the directionality of in- teraction between DW and current, we have measured the DW displacements ∆xn along the direction ⃗n as a function of the angle θ between ⃗n and −⃗j, for a ﬁxed mag- nitude of current density and pulse duration ∆t = 1µs (see Fig. 3 (G and H)).
We have then deduced the vari- ation of velocity vn = ∆xn/∆t as a function of |j| cos θ, which are reported Fig. 3 (I).
As expected the DW ve- locity decreases as the tilting angle increases (i.e.,|j| cosθ decreases).
For |j| cos θ < 2.25 GA/m2, the displacement ∆xn becomes lower than the spatial resolution so that the estimation for vn is zero.
The dispersion of data most probably results from the contributions of DW elasticity, which tends to reduce DW velocity.
Therefore, the veloc- ity DW without contribution of elasticity should corre- spond to the upper measured values.
Interestingly, those values present a rather good overlap with the velocity curves of Fig.1, which were obtained as a function of the current density and for θ = 0.
This indicates that DW tilting reduces the driving force in the direction normal ⃗n to the DW and suggests that the DW faceting originates from the directionality of driving force f ∝⃗j · ⃗n.
Let us now discuss the implication of the variation of the driving force with DW tilting (∝j cos θ) on uni- versal behaviors.
The second order expansion of cos θ Figure 3.

The back DW conserves its shape and velocity while the front DW becomes pointed, which reduces its veloc- ity and leads to the collapse of the domain (see images E and F).

The error bars reﬂect the uncertainties of tilting angle and displacement.
(≈1 −(1/2)(∂u/∂x)2) introduces a so-called KPZ term (λ(∂u/∂x)2 with λ = −j/2) in the equation of mo- tion [31], which is usually used to describe interface tilt- ing.
However, at large tilting angle, the relation f ∝⃗j ·⃗n should not be compatible with the KPZ minimal model.
In contrast, in the direction ⃗n perpendicular to DW, for a ﬁxed DW tilting, the driving force due to spin-transfer- torque is simply proportional to j cos θ and acts as a magnetic ﬁeld (f ∝H).
This could explain the com- patibility of current induced DW motion with the qEW universality class, which is observed experimentally.
In conclusion, the common universal behaviors with ﬁeld driven DW motion and in particular the agree- ment with the self-consistent description of creep and depinning regimes could help to better understand spin- transfer-torque induced DW motion experiments [2] since5 it allows a clear identiﬁcation of dynamical regimes and to discriminate universal from material dependent be- haviors [27].
It would be also very interesting to study the universal behaviors of DWs driven by spin-orbit- torque [32] and of DWs in antiferromagnets [33].
More- over, the instability of transverse alignment between DW and current should have direct implications for potential applications based on the controlled motion of DWs [1] in nanowires.
