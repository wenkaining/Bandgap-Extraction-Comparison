To  realize these applications, a thorough understanding of the localization and delocalization of  interlayer excitons in the moir√© potentials is necessary.
Here, we investigated interlayer exciton  dynamics and transport modulated by the moir√© potentials in WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers in time,  space, and momentum domains using transient absorption microscopy combined with first- principles calculations.
Experimental results verified the theoretical prediction of energetically  favorable K-Q interlayer excitons and unraveled exciton-population dynamics that was  controlled by the twist-angle-dependent energy difference between the K-Q and K-K excitons.
Spatially- and temporally-resolved exciton-population imaging directly visualizes exciton  localization by twist-angle-dependent moir√© potentials of ~100 meV. Exciton transport deviates  significantly from normal diffusion due to the interplay between the moir√© potentials and strong  many-body interactions, leading to exciton-density- and twist-angle-dependent diffusion length.
These results have important implications for designing vdW heterostructures for exciton and  spin transport as well as for quantum communication applications.3 Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures assembled from graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and  transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) have emerged as a new class of materials in exploring  new quantum phenomena with designed functionalities1-5.
Spatially-indirect interlayer excitons  can be formed with electrons and holes localized in different TMDCs layers6-9, with much longer  lifetimes than the direct intralayer excitons, achieving long-range exciton- and valley-spin  transport3,4.
Further, lattice mismatch or rotational misalignment in the semiconducting TMDC  heterostructures leads to the formation of moir√© potentials (e.g. nanoscale periodic energy  potentials for excitons), providing a configurable solid-state excitonic analog to ultracold atoms  in optical lattices or photons in photonic crystals10,11.
Scanning tunneling microscopy  measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations for MoS2-WSe2 10,12,13 have  shown that the bandgap of the heterobilayer vary spatially within the moir√© pattern, suggesting  amplitudes of moir√© potentials as large as hundreds of meV. More recently, far-field optical  measurements have indicated the existence of moir√© excitons in semiconducting TMDC  heterostructures by observations, such as trap exciton emission, flat exciton band, spatially  varying valley polarization, and resonantly hybridized excitons14-19.
How the quantum states of many-body systems are localized or delocalized at well- defined positions in space by energy potentials is a long-standing question in physics20.
Although  the photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectroscopy measurements from aforementioned  studies14-19 provided indirect evidences for the localized excitons in moir√© potentials, it still  remains largely unknown the time- and length-scale of the localization.
The transport of  spatially-indirect excitons has been extensively investigated in electrically-biased coupled  quantum wells, demonstrating long-range transport and quantum many-body effects, including  Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation and superfluidity of excitons21-23; although moir√© patterns do not4 exist in these systems.
Recently, long-range interlayer exciton diffusion over micrometer  lengthscale in TMDC heterostructures at both low temperature and room temperature was  reported3,24; however, the role of moir√© potentials has not been addressed.
Here, we report direct  ultrafast spatial imaging of interlayer exciton transport in the WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers with two  different twist angles (0ÔÇ∞ and 60ÔÇ∞) with a temporal resolution of ~200 fs and a spatial precision of  ~50 nm.
In combination with first-principles calculations, these results provide a comprehensive  picture of the localization and delocalization of the interlayer excitons in the presence of twist- angle-dependent moir√© potentials.
We performed measurements on the WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers, prepared using a  modified two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method (see Methods and Fig. S1 for more  details) that provides contamination‚Äêfree and atomically-sharp interfaces uniform over the  micrometer length scale25.
Fig. 1a shows an optical image of a typical WS2-WSe2 heterobilayer,  grown on a Si wafer with a 285-nm-thickness oxide.
The larger bottom layer is a single layer  WS2 (1L-WS2), while the smaller top layer is a single layer WSe2 (1L-WSe2).
The presence of  the vertical heterostructures constituted of WS2 and WSe2 monolayers was confirmed using  Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S2).
The heterobilayers have two stacking orientations with twist  angles of ùúÉ= 0¬∞ and 60¬∞, which are energetically favorable in the modified two-step CVD  growth25.
The twist angle can be readily determined by the relative orientation of the top and  bottom triangles, because the orientation of each triangle is directly correlated with its  microscopic crystal orientation26,27.
We further confirmed the stacking orientation using the  second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy (Fig. S3).
The SHG intensity of WS2-WSe2  (60¬∞) is strongly suppressed due to the destructive interference of the second harmonic fields,  while it is enhanced in WS2-WSe2 (0¬∞) by constructive interference28.
The existence of moir√©5 patterns can be directly observed by high-resolution annular dark-field (ADF) scanning  transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image (Fig. 1b for 60¬∞ and Fig.S4 for 0¬∞).
The lattice  mismatch of the monolayers of the WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers is about 4%, as confirmed by the  selected area electron diffraction images shown in Fig. S5.
This mismatch leads to the moir√©  periodicity of ~8.5 nm (Fig. 1b and Fig. S4).

PL spectra  are normalized with respect to the peak intensity of the 1L-WS2.
e, PL image of the WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers with  twist angles of 0¬∞ and 60¬∞ taken at 295 K. The detection energy is 1.95 eV, corresponding to the A exciton emission  of the 1L-WS2.
f, PL image of the WS2-WSe2 heterobilayer with twist angle of 60¬∞ taken at 78 K. The detection  energy is 1.45 eV, corresponding to the interlayer exciton emission.
The WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers have a type-II band alignment, as shown schematically in  Fig. 1c29,30, resulting in the formation of spatially-indirect interlayer charge-transfer excitons,  with electrons and holes residing in the WS2 and WSe2 layers, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1d,6 the photoluminescence (PL) spectra at 78 K display a new emission peak at ~1.45 eV in both  WS2-WSe2 with twist angles of 0¬∞ and 60¬∞, which is attributed to the emission from the  interlayer excitons16.
Figs. 1e and 1f depict PL images collected at 1.95 eV and 1.45 eV,  corresponding to the emission from the intralayer A exciton in WS2 and the interlayer exciton  emission, respectively.
Significant PL quench of the WS2 A exciton in the heterostructures  indicates an efficient charge separation (Fig.1e).
The PL microscopy image (Fig. 1f) of the  interlayer exciton at 1.45 eV shows that the emission is homogenous over the heterostructure  region, confirming the high quality of the interfacial contact.
We also observed that the interlayer  exciton emission intensity in the 60¬∞ heterobilayer was about one order magnitude higher than  that of 0¬∞ (Fig. 1d).
To gain insights on how the energy landscape for the interlayer excitons is modified by  the moir√© pattern of the 0¬∞ and 60¬∞ heterobilayers, we performed first-principles calculations  using DFT (see Methods and Supplementary Note 1 for details).
Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b show a  moir√© supercell for the twist angles of 0ÔÇ∞ and 60ÔÇ∞, respectively.
Highlighted in color are different  local, high-symmetry stacking configurations (Fig. S6); they are labeled according to the  nomenclature introduced in Ref.13, where Hh h and Rh M correspond to the atomic registries of 2H  and 3R bulk polytypes, respectively.
We calculated the energy of the four lowest-energy optical  transitions between the valence-band maximum (VBM) in the K valley and the conduction-band  minimum (CBM) in the K and the Q valleys (Fig. 2c and Table S1) for different stacking  configurations.
Notably, the lowest-energy transition is always K-Q and therefore K-Q interlayer  excitons are expected to represent the ground state instead of the more commonly discussed K-K  excitons.
The moir√© potentials plotted along the main diagonal of the moir√© supercells, shown in  Fig. 2d (also see Table S2), indicate that the spatial variations for 0ÔÇ∞ are much stronger (deep7 potential) than for 60ÔÇ∞ (shallow potential).
The effect is illustrated for K-K singlet excitons by  the vertical arrows in Fig. 2d.
The gray area in Fig. 2d indicates the spatial variation of the  energy difference between the K-Q and the K-K transitions, ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ (also indicated in Fig. 2c).
Averaged over the whole moir√© pattern, the mean difference ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ is larger for 0ÔÇ∞ than for 60ÔÇ∞  (88 meV vs. 62 meV, see Table S3).

The different lines correspond to the four lowest-energy optical  transitions as marked in c. Circles and triangles for K-K indicate spin-singlet and spin-triplet excitations,  respectively.
Vertical arrows indicate the potential variations of the K-K spin-singlet excitons.
The gray area  indicates the difference between the lowest-energy K-Q and K-K transitions, ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ. Averaged over the whole moir√©  pattern, the difference ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ is larger for 0ÔÇ∞ than for 60ÔÇ∞. The theoretical results show that the moir√© pattern leads to  a twist-angle-dependent modulation of the energy landscape of the interlayer excitons.8 Two predictions can be made based on the DFT calculations: (i) the population dynamics  of the K-K and K-Q excitons should be affected by the twist-angle-dependent ‚àÜEKQ; and (ii) the  twist-angle-dependent moir√© potentials should lead to different degrees of localization of the  interlayer excitons in 0ÔÇ∞ and 60ÔÇ∞ heterobilayers.
First, to test the prediction (i), we selectively monitored electrons and holes in the K  valleys using pump-probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, as schematically shown in  Fig. 3a.
We employed a linearly-polarized pump excitation (at either 1.80 eV or 1.60 eV) to  create A excitons in WSe2.
Following the photoexcitation, electrons are transferred from WSe2 to  WS2 within 100 fs, while the holes remained in the WSe2 31.
We used a linearly-polarized probe  beam at 1.60 eV, to monitor the hole population in the K (or K‚Äô) valley of WSe2, and a probe  energy of 2.00 eV, to track the electron population in the K (or K‚Äô) valley of WS2.
Because the  holes reside in the K valley of WSe2 for both the K-K and K-Q interlayer excitons, the hole  population probed at 1.60 eV corresponds to the sum of the K-K and K-Q exciton populations  (ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ+ ùëÅùêæ‚àíùëÑ).
On the other hand, electrons are located in different valleys for the K-K and K- Q interlayer excitons.
The dynamics probed at 2.00 eV reflects only the K-K interlayer exciton  population (ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ), because only the electrons in the K valley of WS2 contribute the TA signal.
Thus, the population dynamics of the K-K and K-Q excitons can be elucidated by comparing the  dynamics probed at 1.60 eV to that probed at 2.00 eV.   As shown in Fig. 3b, the decay time of (ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ+ ùëÅùêæ‚àíùëÑ) in the heterostructures is ~1 ns at  295 K, which is much longer than the intralayer excitons in 1L-WSe2 (~40 ps), due to the  spatially-indirect nature of the interlayer excitons6.
This lifetime increases to more than 3 ns at  78 K (Fig. 3c), showing similar temperature dependence as the PL decay (Fig. S7), likely due to  the suppressed non-radiative recombination8.
The hole dynamics do not exhibit significant twist-9 angle dependence (Fig. 3b and Fig. S8).
The ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ dynamics probed at 2.00 eV at 295 K is  presented in Fig. 3d and Fig. S9, showing that the decay time for 0¬∞ is about 3 times shorter than  that for 60¬∞.
Temperature-dependent measurements demonstrate that the K-K exciton decay time  in both the 0¬∞ (Fig. 3e) and the 60¬∞ (Fig. S10) heterobilayers become significantly shorter at  lower temperatures, in stark contrast to the total exciton population shown in Fig. 3c.
All  measurements were carried out at an exciton density of 4.1ÔÇ¥1012 cm-2 and the dynamics do not  show significant dependence on exciton density (Fig. S11).

The hole dynamics is determined by selectively exciting the WSe2 layer and  probing the WSe2 layer using a probe photon energy of 1.60 eV. The hole population corresponds to the sum of K-K  and K-Q exciton populations.
The electron dynamics is determined by selectively exciting the WSe2 layer and  probing the WS2 layer using a probe photon energy of 2.00 eV. The electron population reflects the K-K exciton  population only.

e, Temperature-dependent electron dynamics for the 0¬∞ heterobilayer.
f, Plot of the fitted  decay time of the K-K exciton shown in e as function of temperature.
The dashed lines are guides to the eye.
All  measurements were carried out at an exciton density of 4.1ÔÇ¥1012 cm-2.
All decay curves are fitted using a bi- exponential decay function, convoluted with a Gaussian function.
These results support that the K-K and K-Q  exciton dynamics are modulated by the twist-angle dependence of the energy gap ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ.10 The twist-angle- and temperature-dependent K-K exciton dynamics can be explained by  intraband scattering of electrons between the K and Q valleys, influenced by ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ. Initially, the  electrons transferred from WSe2 reside in the K valley of WS2, but they are quickly scattered to  the Q valley by the intervalley scattering (Fig. 3a).
The scattering from K to Q through phonon  emission does not require thermal activation (‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ> 0) and is much faster than the electron‚Äì hole recombination ( ~100 ps vs. ~3 ns at 78K).
On the other hand, the back scattering of  electrons from the Q to the K valley by phonon absorption is a thermal process and the  probability of this process is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics, ùëì(ùê∏) ‚àù1/(ùëí ‚àí ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ ùëòùêµùëá‚àí1),  where ùëòùêµ is the Boltzmann constant and ùëá is the temperature.
At higher temperature, more  electrons are backscattered to the K valley and therefore ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ increases, leading to a longer  decay time (Fig. 3e).
The impact of temperature for the scattering from Q to K can be seen in  Fig. 3f, where the K-K exciton decay time increases as the temperature increases.
Higher  temperature is required for 0¬∞ than for 60¬∞ to thermally excite phonons to scatter electrons from  Q to K (Fig. 3f), directly confirming that ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ is larger, as predicted by DFT (88 meV vs. 62  meV, see Table S3 for more details).
The larger ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ for 0¬∞ leads to less efficient Q-K scattering  and, hence, shorter K-K exciton decay time than for 60¬∞ (Fig. 3d).
Therefore, by selectively  measuring the dynamics of the K-K and K-Q excitons, these experiments verified prediction (i).
Overall, the PL dynamics is similar to the hole dynamics (Fig. S7), implying  contributions from both K-K and K-Q excitons.
Because of the 4% lattice mismatch between 1L- WS2 and 1L-WSe2, the K-K excitons have small momentum mismatch and therefore are  probably momentum-indirect.
The momentum mismatch for K-Q excitons is even larger and  should lead to less emission than that from K-K excitons due to the requirement for stronger11 phonon assistance.
At equilibrium,  ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ ùëÅùêæ‚àíùëÑ= ùëí ‚àí ‚àÜùê∏ùêæùëÑ ùëòùêµùëá and thus, a larger ùëÅùêæ‚àíùêæ exists for 60¬∞ than 0¬∞  at a given temperature.
This explains the stronger PL emission intensity and the higher emission  energy observed for 60¬∞ at 78 K (Fig. 1d), reflecting more emission from K-K excitons.
Next, we investigated the twist-angle dependence of interlayer exciton transport to test  our prediction (ii).
We have recently demonstrated transient absorption microscopy (TAM) as a  new means to image the time-dependent carrier and exciton transport32,33.
Briefly, a Gaussian  pump beam was fixed on the sample and a Gaussian probe beam was scanned relative to the  pump beam with a pair of galvanometer scanners, to obtain interlayer-exciton propagation at  different time delays (more details can be found in the Supplementary Note 2 and Fig. S12).
The  interlayer exciton transport in both 60¬∞ and 0¬∞ heterobilayers was imaged with a linearly  polarized pump with a photon energy of 1.60 eV and with a beam size of ~500 nm (Fig. S13),  creating A excitons in WSe2.
The exciton density at time zero (details in Supplementary Note 3)  was between 2.1ÔÇ¥1012 and 6.0ÔÇ¥1012 cm-2, corresponding to an mean inter-exciton distance of 4-7  nm, larger than the interlayer exciton radius (ùëé0 ~ 2 nm)34.
At zero delay time, the excitons have  a spatial distribution of ùëõ(ùë•, 0) = ùëÅ0ùëíùë•ùëù[‚àí (ùë•‚àíùë•0) 2 2ùúé02 ].
Within the pulse width of ~200 fs, the  electrons were transferred to WS2, leading to the formation of interlayer excitons.
We employed  a probe energy of 2.00 eV with a beam size of ~400 nm (Fig. S13), to monitor the population of  K-K interlayer excitons (no TA signal was observed in the WS2 only region, Fig. S14).
How the  interlayer excitons move out of the initial volume was measured as function of the pump-probe  time, resulting in a population distribution of ùëõ(ùë•, ùë°) = ùëÅùë°ùëíùë•ùëù[‚àí (ùë•‚àíùë•0) 2 2ùúéùë°2 ]  (Fig. 4a).
The  experimentally measured ùúéùë° 2 ‚àíùúé0 2 corresponds to the mean squared distance travelled by the  interlayer excitons.12 We carried out exciton-density-, temperature-, and twist-angle-dependent TAM  measurements to directly visualize the localization of interlayer excitons.
Normal diffusion  would lead to a linear temporal dependence of ùúéùë° 2 ‚àíùúé0 2 , but a highly nonlinear temporal  dependence was observed for the interlayer excitons in both 0¬∞ and 60¬∞ heterobilayers.
The  anomalous diffusion with faster transport at higher densities (Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c) can be  understood such that the interlayer excitons have permanent electric dipole moments due to the  electron‚Äìhole separation, which results in repulsive dipole‚Äìdipole and exchange interactions,  consistent with the previous report in the MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures3 and coupled quantum- well heterostructures23,35,36.
The strong twist-angle dependent of the overall range of anomalous diffusion suggests  the role of the moir√© potentials.
Excitons are more localized for 0¬∞ than 60¬∞, with a shorter range  of motion for the same exciton density (Fig. 4).
While the repulsive interactions between the  interlayer excitons have been reported for MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures3, a moir√© potential was  absent from the MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures with 0¬∞ twist angle in that study.
Exciton  localization by moir√© potentials is directly visualized by temperature-dependent measurements  (Fig. 4d and Fig. 4e), showing reduced range of exciton motion as temperature decreases.
The  twist-angle dependence confirms a deeper moir√© potential for 0¬∞ and validates prediction (ii).
The transport of interlayer excitons is significantly faster than that of intralayer excitons in 1L- WS2, 1L-WSe2, 2L-WS2, and 2L-WSe2 for exciton densities of ~1012 cm-2 (Fig. 4f and Fig. S15),  demonstrating the central role of many-body repulsive interactions in the transport of interlayer  excitons.13   Fig. 4 | Interlayer exciton transport in moir√© potentials.

The interlayer exciton transport in WS2-WSe2 heterobilayers is also  compared to the exciton diffusion in 1L-WSe2 and 1L-WS2.
The black and grey lines are fits using linear functions.
Note that the exciton diffusion in 1L-WS2 and 1L-WSe2 is measured using the pump photon-energy of 3.10 eV and  probe photon-energy of 2.00 and 1.60 eV, respectively.
These results show that many-body interactions delocalize  interlayer excitons in twist-angle-dependent moir√© potentials.
To quantitatively describe the motion of interlayer excitons in the moir√© potentials, we  employed a model that includes the effects of many-body repulsive interactions and the trapping  potential 23,35-37:                                                     ùúïùëõ(ùë•,ùë°) ùúïùë° = ‚àí‚àá‚àô(ùêΩùê∑ùëñùëìùëì+ ùêΩùëÖùëíùëù) ‚àí ùëõ(ùë•,ùë°) ùúè                                          (1)  where ùúè is the exciton lifetime.
ùêΩùê∑ùëñùëìùëì describes the exciton diffusion, which can be written  as: ùêΩùê∑ùëñùëìùëì= ‚àíùê∑‚àô‚àáùëõ(ùë•, ùë°), where ùê∑ is the diffusion coefficient.
ùêΩùëÖùëíùëù describes the many-body  repulsive interaction between the interlayer excitons, which is given by: ùêΩùëÖùëíùëù= ‚àíùëõ(ùë•, ùë°) ‚àôùúá‚àôùë¢0 ‚àô ‚àáùëõ(ùë•, ùë°), where ùúá is the reduced exciton mass and ùë¢0 is the exciton interaction energy per unity  of density.
Because of the small interlayer separation of ~7 √Ö, the exchange term is much larger14 than the dipole-dipole interaction and dominates the many-body repulsion force3,37.
Thus, ùë¢0 is  given by: ùúã ‚Ñè2 ùúá (see the Supplementary Note 4).
The diffusion constant ùê∑ is related to the trapping  moir√© potential U and can be described as: ùê∑0 ‚àôexp [‚àí ùëà ùëòùêµùëá+ùë¢0‚àóùëõ(ùë•,ùë°)], where ùê∑0 is the exciton  diffusion constant in the absence of the trapping potential 37.
At higher densities, more excitons  accumulate in the potential minima and the repulsive exciton-exciton interactions effectively  screen the moir√© potentials, leading to delocalization of the excitons.
Note that Mott density  estimated from the Bohr radius38, (0.1 ‚àí0.3) √ó ùëé0 ‚àí2 =(2.5-7.5)√ó1012 cm-2, is similar to the  exciton densities at time zero in our measurements.
However, recent ultrafast mid-infrared  measurements39 demonstrated strongly bound interlayer excitons with binding energy of ~ 126  meV survived even at density as high as 2 √ó1012 cm-2.
Further, as excitons move out the initial  pump spot, the exciton density decreases quickly below the Mott density.
Therefore, the electron  and hole should remain largely correlated and discussion using an exciton picture is valid here.
Thus, the depth of moir√© potentials can be determined by modeling the exciton-density-  and temperature-dependent exciton transport data.
As shown in Fig. 4b and Fig.4d, solid lines  represent the simulated ùúéùë° 2 ‚àíùúé0 2 as function of the delay time based on Eq. 1 for the 60¬∞  heterobilayer, and a moir√© potential of ùëà= 0.11 ùëíùëâ was obtained (other parameters are listed in  Table S4).
A deeper trapping potential of ùëà= 0.15 eV was determined for the 0¬∞ heterobilayer  by fitting data in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4e.
The trapping potentials measured by the TAM experiments  represent the averaged potentials experienced by the interlayer K-K excitons, because the pump  and probe beam size of ~400 nm is much larger than the moir√© periodicity of ~8.5 nm.
The  measured potential values agree well with the averaged potential heights of 0.08 eV and 0.17 eV  for 60¬∞ and 0¬∞, respectively, predicted by our DFT calculations (Fig. 2d and Table S2).
In the15 absence of the moir√© potentials, the free interlayer excitons are very mobile with a diffusion  constant of 9.0 cm2 s-1 at room temperature.
The transport of the interlayer exciton is determined by the interplay between the moir√©  potentials and many-body exciton interactions.
Strong many-body interactions can overcome the  moir√© potentials, leading to a significant delocalization of interlayer excitons at densities >1012  cm-2.
For instance, excitons can travel ~200 nm in 1 ns at a density of 2.0ÔÇ¥1012 cm-2 at room  temperature.
The delocalization at high densities is consistent with the recent report of broad  interlayer PL peak at high density that splits into several narrow lines at low power15.
PL spectra  taken at high exciton densities reflect excitons that sample many locations with different energy  levels, resulting in broad emission lines.
The localization and delocalization of the interlayer excitons presented here have  important implications for the potential applications of vdW heterostructures; for long-range  transport, more delocalized interlayer excitons are preferred and, therefore, deep moir√© potentials  should be avoided.
On the other hand, for applications such as quantum emitters, deep moir√©  potential should be preferred, to localize excitons.
We show that the free interlayer excitons in  absence of a moir√© potential can be very mobile, with a diffusion constant of 9.0 cm2 s-1 at room  temperature.
Further, interlayer exciton transport significantly deviates from normal diffusion,  and therefore to correctly predict exciton diffusion length both the exciton density and the depth  of moir√© potential have to be taken into account.
We also stress that K-Q interlayer excitons are  the ground state instead of the commonly assumed K-K excitons and are necessary to be  considered when discussing interlayer excitons in the WS2-WSe2 systems. References  1.

Briefly, a quartz  boat with tungsten disulfide powder (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) and a piece of Si wafer with a 285-nm- thick oxide (1 cm √ó 3 cm) were placed at the center and the downstream of the furnace for the  growth of the WS2 monolayers respectively.
The system was firstly cleaned by the high pure Ar  gas (400 SCCM) for 15‚Äâmin.
The furnace was then heated to 1050‚Äâ¬∞C and kept for 10‚Äâmin for the  growth of WS2 monolayers.
The as-prepared WS2 monolayers were used as the new substrate for  the vertically growth of the WSe2 monolayers.
The tungsten diselenide powder (99.8%, Alfa  Aesar) and the substrate with the WS2 monolayers were placed at the center and downstrem of  the quartz tube respectively.
A mixture flow of H2/Ar (with 5% H2) gas was used as the carrier  gas and the growth temperature was set at 1000¬∞C.
After the growth, the furnace was cooled  down to the room temperature naturally.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy  For scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, CVD grown WS2-WSe2  vertical heterostructures were transferred onto a copper grid using the poly(methyl methacrylate)  PMMA-assisted transfer method.
The STEM measurements were carried out on JEOL  ARM200F microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a probe-forming aberration  corrector.
For HAADF-STEM images, the inner and outer collection angles of the ADF detector  are 68 and 280 mrad, respectively.
The convergence semiangle is about 28 mard.20 Confocal photoluminescence (PL) microscopy   PL measurements were performed by employing a home-built confocal PL microscope.
A  picosecond pulsed diode laser (Pico-Quant, LDH-P-C-450B) with an excitation energy of 2.8 eV  and a repetition rate of 40 MHz was used to excite the sample.
The laser beam was focused onto  the sample using a 50X [(numerical aperture) NA=0.95] objective.
The PL emission was  collected with the same objective, dispersed with a monochromator (Andor Technology) and  detected using a charge coupled device (CCD) (Andor Technology).
PL images were acquired  using a galvanometer scanner (Thorlabs, GVS012) to scan the excitation beam.
Time-resolved  PL was measured using a single-photon avalanche diode (PDM series, PicoQuant) and a single- photon counting module (PicoQuant).
For temperature-dependent PL measurements, the sample  was mounted on a cold finger of a continuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat (Janis, ST-500).
A  40X (NA = 0.60) objective was used to focus the laser beam onto the sample.
Transient absorption microscopy (TAM) and spectroscopy   Transient absorption dynamics and transport measurements were taken using a home-built TAM  system, performed in the reflection mode, schematically shown in Fig. S13.
Briefly, a Ti:  Sapphire oscillator (Coherent Mira 900) pumped by a Verdi diode laser (Verdi V18) was used as  the fundamental light source (1.60 eV, 76 MHz, 200 fs).
70% of the pulse energy was fed into  the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (Coherent Mira OPO) to generate the probe beam at 2.00  eV, while the remaining 30% was served as the pump beam.
The pump beam was modulated at 1  MHz using an acoustic optical modulator (AOM) (Model R21080-1DM, Gooch&Housego).
Both pump and probe beams were spatially filtered.
A 60X (NA = 0.95) objective was used to  focus both pump and probe beams onto the sample, and the reflection light was then collected by  the same objective and detected by an avalanche Si photodiode (Hamamatsu).
The change in the21 probe reflection (‚àÜùëÖ) induced by the pump was detected by a lock-in amplifier (HF2LI, Zurich  Instrument).
For morphological imaging, pump and probe beams were spatially overlapped and a  piezo-electric stage (P-527.3Cl, Physik Instrumente) was used to scan the sample with a step size  of 200 nm.
For exciton transport imaging, a galvanometer scanner (Thorlabs GVS012) was used  to scan the probe beam relative to the pump beam in space to obtain the exciton diffusion  profiles.
For transient absorption dynamics measurements, the pump and probe beams were  spatially overlapped and a mechanical translation stage (Thorlabs, LTS300) was used to delay  the probe with respect to the pump.
For the measurements of the hole dynamics, we used the  output of a high‚Äìrepetition rate amplifier (Pharos Light Conversion, 400 kHz) to pump two  independent optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs), one providing the pump (1.80 eV) and the  other supplying the probe (1.60 eV).
Both pump and probe beams were spatially filtered.
An  acousto-optic modulator (Gooch &Housego, R23080-1) was used to modulate the pump beam at  100 kHz.
The change in the probe reflection (‚àÜùëÖ) induced by the pump was detected by a lock-in  amplifier (Stanford Research Instrument, SR830).
For temperature-dependent exciton dynamics and diffusion measurements, the sample  was mounted on a cold finger of a continuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat (Janis, ST-500).
A  40X (NA = 0.60) objective was used to focus both pump and probe beams onto the sample.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The moir√© potentials were calculated by considering different stacking configurations of the  heterobilayers.
The configurations were structurally optimized using density-functional theory  (DFT) as implemented in the ADF-BAND software40 (BAND2018, SCM, Theoretical  Chemistry, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.scm.com).
The22 maximum gradient threshold for geometry optimization was set to 10‚àí3 hartree √Ö‚àí1.
The PBE41  exchange-correlation functional was used together with the valence triple-zeta polarized (TZP)  basis sets composed of Slater-type and numerical orbitals with a small frozen core.
Relativistic  effects, like spin-orbit coupling (SOC), were taken into account by employing the scalar Zero  Order Regular Approximation (ZORA)42.
The k-space integration was done with the 2D variant  of the regular k-space grid using the quadratic interpolation method, resulting in 9 symmetry- inequivalent k-points.
The convergence of the k-space grid was checked; a denser grid did not  significantly change the transition energies.
The van der Waals interactions were accounted for  using the D3 correction together with the Becke-Johnson damping function as proposed by  Grimme43.

Density functional theory calculations  The optimized lattice parameters a of WS2 and WSe2 monolayers are 3.162 √Ö and 3.295 √Ö,  respectively.
This corresponds to a lattice mismatch of about 4%.
For the twist angles of 0ÔÇ∞ and  60ÔÇ∞, this leads to an incommensurate moir√© superstructure that could best be approximated by  supercells containing thousands of atoms (see Fig. 2).
Such large systems are too demanding  even for standard DFT.
Therefore, we modeled the moir√© superstructures by considering the  high-symmetry stacking configurations as indicated in Fig. 2 and Fig S7.
These configurations  were studied by employing primitive cells that contain 6 atoms, with the lattice constant a set  according to three choices: (i) a is equal to the value of the WS2 monolayer (and the WSe2 layer  is compressed), (ii) a is equal to the value of the WSe2 monolayer (and the WS2 layer is strained),  (iii) a is an intermediate value that minimized the total strain of the system.
Fig. 2C shows a schematic representation of a typical band structure of all stacking  configurations of the heterobilayer.
The band structure of WS2-WSe2 heterobilayer close to the  Fermi level is defined by the electron bands (conduction band minimum, CBM) that involve  electronic states from the WS2 layer and the hole bands (top of valence band, VBM) that involve  states of the WSe2 layer.
Therefore, lattice choice (i) was used to determine the band edge energy  of the CBM and choice (ii) to determine the band edge energy of the VBM, relative to the  vacuum level, respectively.
Their difference provides a good estimate of the optical-transition  energies (band gaps) of the stacking configurations of the heterobilayer and the effects of the  compressive or tensile strain on the electronic structure are minimized.
The values of all of these  transitions are given in Table S1.
The (spin) splitting of the bands at the VBM or CBM Fig. 2C is  due to the spin-orbit coupling, giving rise to the total of four interband transitions, out of which,3 only the ones from the VBM are indicated by arrows.
They are either the momentum-direct  transitions in the K valley (K-K) or the momentum-indirect transitions between the VBM in K  and the CBM in the Q valley (K-Q).
For all stacking configurations, K-Q forms the fundamental  band gap.
The values in Figure 2D are given relative to the K-Q transition in the ùëÖ‚Ñé ùëã stacking,  because the moir√© potential for the motion of the excitons is defined by the local variations of the  transitions within the moir√© pattern and not by their absolute values.
DFT is known to  underestimate the band gap size.
However, the band gap differences between different stacking  configurations of the same heterobilayer should be well described and, by considering the  relative energies, the band gap error cancels out.
For that reason, we believe it is not necessary to  perform more accurate band structure calculations employing, e.g., hybrid functionals or the GW  method.
The interlayer transitions 1 and 2 are either spin-conserving (forming a spin-singlet  exciton) or spin-flipping (forming a spin-triplet exciton), depending on the relative lattice  orientation (twist angle).
In TMDC monolayers, spin-conserving transitions are optically bright  and spin-flip transitions are optically dark.
However, as recently shown by Yu et al.5, the  monolayer selection rules do not apply to heterobilayers, where due to the absence of the in- plane mirror symmetry, both transitions are optically bright.
Therefore, we have to consider both  transitions on equal footing.
The information about the spin-singlet or spin-triplet K-K  transitions in Fig. 2D was inferred from the analysis of the spin orientations of the band states in  connection with Table 2 of Yu et al.5.4 To analyze structural properties of the stacking configurations, we adopted the lattice  choice (iii) (see above) and optimized the in-plane lattice parameters (a) and the interlayer  distances (d).
These values are given in the following table:    0ÔÇ∞  60ÔÇ∞ System ÔÄ†ÔÅÑE [meV]  a [√Ö]  d [√Ö]  System  ÔÄ†ÔÅÑE [meV] a [√Ö]  d [√Ö]  ùëÖ‚Ñé ‚Ñé  109.3  3.222  3.512  ùêª‚Ñé ‚Ñé  0.0  3.221  2.911 ùëÖ‚Ñé ùëã  14.9  3.227  2.862  ùêª‚Ñé ùëã  27.8  3.227  2.917 ùëÖ‚Ñé ùëÄ  0.0  3.226  2.858 ùêª‚Ñé ùëÄ  103.5  3.226  3.463  Structural and energetic properties of fully optimized high-symmetry stacking configurations for  0ÔÇ∞ and 60ÔÇ∞ twist angles (following the lattice option (iii)): the total energy differences (ÔÅÑE), the  in-plane lattice parameters (a), and the interlayer distances (d).
While the in-plane lattice parameters almost do not vary between different stacking  configurations, the interlayer distances do. 2.
Factors that limit the spatial precision of TAM imaging  There are two main sources of noise contributing to the TAM imaging: laser fluctuation noise  and electronic noise from the detection system (for example, detector and lock-in amplifier).
Noise due to laser intensity fluctuations can be effectively eliminated by using heterodyne lock- in detection with MHz modulation where the intensity of the excitation beam (or additional local  oscillator) is modulated by an acoustic-optical modulator1.
Subsequently, a lock-in amplifier  referenced to this modulation frequency can sensitively extract the induced signal.
The  fluctuation of laser intensity (1/ùëì noise) usually occurs at low frequency (< 10 kHz).
When ùëì is  in the MHz range, the laser intensity noise becomes near the quantum shot noise limit, which is5 always present because of the Poissonian distribution of the photon counts at the detector.
The  pixel dwell time should be significantly longer than the modulation period to allow for reliable  demodulation for each pixel.
Such a modulation scheme has been successfully applied to  transient absorption microscopy to achieve single-molecule sensitivity.
In our experiments, we  use a modulation frequency of 1 MHz.
The TAM instrumentation described here could detect a  differential transmission ‚àÜùëáùëá ‚ÅÑ  of 10‚àí7, three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than  conventional TA spectroscopy.
In the TAM imaging of exciton transport, the measured carrier distribution is convoluted  with profiles of pump and probe beams, so that the measured carrier distribution is written as                                        ùúéùëöùëíùëéùë†ùë¢ùëüùëíùëöùëíùëõùë° 2 = ùúéùëíùë•ùëêùëñùë°ùëúùëõ 2 + ùúéùëùùë¢ùëöùëù 2 + ùúéùëùùëüùëúùëèùëí 2                                  (S1) The exciton diffusion is written as                                                                       ùêø2 = ùúéùë° 2 ‚àíùúé0 2                                                         (S2) Since ùúéùëùùë¢ùëöùëù 2  and ùúéùëùùëüùëúùëèùëí 2  do not change with the pump-probe delay, the diffusion length is only  determined by the change of the exciton density profiles.
Here we performed a sensitivity analysis by differentiating equation S2 and obtain the  error of the measured diffusion length written as                    ‚àÜùêø= ‚àö ùúéùë°2 ùúéùë°2‚àíùúé02 (‚àÜùúéùë° 2)2 + ùúé02 ùúéùë°2‚àíùúé02 (‚àÜùúé0 2)2 = ‚àö‚àÜùúéùë° 2 + ( ùúé0 ùêø) 2 (‚àÜùúé0 2 ‚àí‚àÜùúéùë° 2)                  (S3) From equation (S3), we can clearly see that the error mainly comes from the uncertainty of  Gaussian profiles obtained at different time delays, which is determined by the signal-to-noise of  the TAM system.
3. Determination of exciton density  The absorption of the 1L-WSe2 is determined from the differential reflection spectra.
For the  micro-reflection spectroscopy, the white light from a stabilized tungsten-halogen light source6 (Thorlabs) was focused onto a pinhole with a diameter of 10 ¬µm.
It was then collimated and  focused onto the sample with a 40X (NA = 0.6) objective.
The reflected light was collected with  the same objective, dispersed with a monochromator (Andor Technology) and detected by a TE  cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) (Andor Technology).
The differential reflectance is defined  as                                                          ùõøùëÖ(ùúÜ) = ùëÖùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëí‚àíùëÖùë†ùë¢ùëèùë†ùë°ùëüùëéùë°ùëí ùëÖùë†ùë¢ùëèùë†ùë°ùëüùëéùë°ùëí                                                   (S4)  where ùëÖùë†ùëéùëöùëùùëôùëí is the reflectance intensity of the sample with substrate and ùëÖùë†ùë¢ùëèùë†ùë°ùëüùëéùë°ùëí is the  reflectance intensity of the bare substrate.
For temperature-dependent measurements, the sample  was mounted on a cold finger of a continuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat (Janis, ST-500).
For the ultrathin film on a transparent substrate, the differential reflection is directly  related to the absorption by the following equation2-4:                                                       ùõøùëÖ(ùúÜ) = 4 ùëõùë†ùë¢ùëè 2 ‚àí1 ùê¥(ùúÜ)                                                              (S5)  where ùëõùë†ùë¢ùëè is the refractive index of the quartz substrate.
We assume it to be wavelength  independent for the spectral range investigated in this study.
The calculated absorption of 1L- WSe2 at different temperature is shown in Fig. S16.
In the TAM measurements, excitons are generated by the absorption of pump lasers.
The peak  fluence of pump pulse (ùëÉùëì) could be calculated as:                                                       ùëÉùëì= ùëÉ ùê¥‚àóùëì                                                                         (S6)  where ùëÉ is the average laser power, ùê¥ is the effective area of the pump beam, ùëì is the repetition  rate of the laser.
Then, the injected exciton density (ùëõ) is obtained as:                                                      ùëõ= ùê¥(ùúÜ)‚àóùëÉùëì ‚Ñèùúà                                                                       (S7)  where ùê¥(ùúÜ) and ‚Ñèùúà are the absorption and photon energy of pump pulse respectively.7 4.
Exchange and dipole-dipole interactions   For small transferred momenta in exciton-exciton scattering, exciton interaction energy per unity  of density (ùë¢0) is given by                                                                      ùë¢0 = ùúã ‚Ñè2 ùúáùúí(ùëë)                                                            (S8)  where ùúá is the reduced exciton mass and ùëë is the effective separation between the electron and  hole layer.
The dimensionless function ùúí(ùëë) has two-well defined limits, ùëë‚â™ùëé2ùëë ùêµ and ùëë‚â•ùëé2ùëë ùêµ  (2D exciton Bohr radius).
The first limit corresponds to the exciton-exciton exchange interaction.
In this situation, ùúí(ùëë‚â™ùëé2ùëë ùêµ) is very close to unity6, ùúí(ùëë) = 1.036, according to first-principles  calculations7.
The second limit is a well-defined dipole-dipole interaction.
In this case, ùúí(ùëë> ùëé2ùëë ùêµ) = ùëé2ùëë ùêµ/(2ùëë) and eq.
(S8) reduces to ùë¢0 = 4ùúã(ùëí2/ùúÄ)ùëë, where ùúÄ is the dielectric constant.     II.

In the case of  the 1L-WS2, the ùê∏2g 1  and ùê¥1g modes are determined to be ~ 350 cm-1 and ~ 420 cm-1 respectively.
For the 1L-WSe2, ùê∏2g 1  and ùê¥1g modes are observed at ~ 250 cm-1.
The Raman peak position and  intensity ratio of the 1L-WS2 and 1L-WSe2 are consistent with the previous report8.
The Raman  spectra were collected by a confocal Raman system (HORBIA Jobin Yvon, XploRA).
A CW  laser with an excitation energy of 2.33 eV was used to excite the sample, which was focused  onto the sample with a 100X (NA= 0.90) objective.
A grating of 1800 lines per mm was used in  the measurements which provides a spectral resolution of 1.9 cm-1.
To minimize any thermal  damage in the air, all measurements were taken with excitation power of 1 mW and an  integration time of 1 s. The spectrometer was calibrated with a Si substrate at 520 cm-1 before the  measurements.9   Fig. S3.

We note that the initial  fast components in the TA dynamics of the holes arise from the A exciton decay of the 1L-WSe2  because pump excites the WSe2 and the slow components reflect the interlayer exciton  recombination.12         Fig. S8.
