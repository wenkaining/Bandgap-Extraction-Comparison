Both give very similar results because of the characteristics of their symmetry.
Quantum- mechanical distortion appears through ﬂuctuation of normal modes and the degeneracy of the ground state is not lifted.

PACS: 75.10.Jm; 75.40.Gb; 75.80.+q Keywords: Spin Jahn–Teller effect; Exchange striction; Quantum spin; Vanadium spinel The highly degenerate antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the pyrochlore lattice is very interesting.
Reduction of the degeneracy through the distance dependence of exchange coupling was investigated before by Terao [1,2] with classical spins.
Detailed investigations into the spin Jahn–Teller effect were given for tetramer models with classical spin and quantum spin-1 2 by Tchernyshyov et al. [3,4] and by Yamashita and Ueda [5], respectively, on the basis of static distortion.
Recently, quantum-mechanical treatment of distortion was given by the present authors [6,7].
In the present paper, we point out the similarity between the regular triangle and tetrahedron clusters with respect to the effects of distortion upon the degenerate ground spin- state of the AF Heisenberg Hamiltonian of spin-1 2.
We consider the role of the symmetry of the spin-states in distorting non-magnetic clusters.
The tetragonal distortion at the phase transition of spinels is discussed in a context of bond-order in non-magnetic states.
The AF Hamiltonian for the regular cluster is H0 ¼ 2J0 P ‘o‘0s‘  s‘0, where J0o0 and s ¼ 1 2.
The ground states of the triangle and tetrahedron clusters conform to the doublet E0 and E representations for the D3h and Td point groups, respectively.
The eigenvalue equations are H0jE0ii ¼ ð3 2ÞJ0jE0ii, i ¼ 1, 2, with the total spin S ¼ 1 2 for the triangle, and H0jEZi ¼ 3J0jEZi, Z ¼ u, v, with S ¼ 0 for the tetrahedron.
We put aside the Kramers degeneracy.
The spin correlations hs‘  s‘0i in these states are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 by the numerals by the bonds.
The distortions for the triangle and the tetrahedron are, respectively, classiﬁed into A0 1, E0 (Q1; Q2, their normal coordinates) modes by the D3h group and into A1, T2, E ðQu; QvÞ modes by the Td group.
The A0 1 and A modes are the breathing ones.
The E and E0 modes are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.
The perturbation Hamiltonians by the E0 and E modes are H0 E0 ¼ ðP2 1 þ P2 2Þ=2m þ mo2 E0ðQ2 1 þ Q2 2Þ=2  2J0 E0ðQ1f 1 þ Q2f 2Þ ð1Þ ARTICLE IN PRESS www.elsevier.com/locate/jmmm 0304-8853/$ - see front matter r 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Note that fa’s for the T2 representation for the tetrahedron vanish and T2  E is reduced to T1  T2, hence the T2 mode plays no role.
The static displacement splits the energies for the doublet E0 and E spin-states.
The changes in energies are estimated as dE0 ¼  3J02 E0 4mo2 E0 at ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Q2 1 þ Q2 2 q ¼ ﬃﬃﬃ 3 2 r jJ0 E0j moE02 (3) for the triangle and dE0 ¼  3J02 E 2mo2 E at ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Q2 u þ Q2 v q ¼ ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p jJ0 Ej mo2 E (4) for the tetrahedron.
We consider the dynamical displacement by representing Qa by phonon operators, by a and ba, and introducing the modiﬁed operator ~ba ¼ ba  ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p J0 af a= ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ m_o3 a p , Eqs.
(1) and (2) are rewritten as H0 ¼ X a½_oað ~b y a ~ba þ 1=2Þ  2J02 af 2 a=mo2 a. (5) Commutators of the modiﬁed operators are ½ ~ba; ~b y a ¼ 1 and ½ ~ba; ~ba ¼ ½ ~b y a; ~b y a ¼ 0; so ~ba, ~b y a are boson-like.
Although the excited states are complicated because ~ba’s with different a’s are not commutable, the ground state with respect to ~ba is deﬁned as ~baj    i0 ¼ 0 : In the subspace of the modiﬁed ground spin-states, H0 ¼ X a  2J02 af 2 a=mo2 a þ _oa=2, (6) where f 2 a ’s are proportional to the unit matrix, then, the degeneracy is not lifted.
The changes in energy dE0 for the triangle and the tetrahedron are, apart from the zero-point motion, 3J02 E0=2mo2 E0 and 3J02 E=mo2 E; respectively, which are twice that by the static model, Eqs. (3) and (4).
In the subspace of the modiﬁed ground spin-states, fQ1; Q2g ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 3=2 p J0 E0=mo2 E0fsx; szg, (7) for the triangle and fQu; Qvg ¼  ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p J0 E=mo2 Efsz; sxg (8) for the tetrahedron.
The expected values of Q1 and Qv vanish due to sx, and their ﬂuctuations are estimated as hE0ijQ2 1jE0ii0 ¼ 3J02 E0=2m2o4 E0 þ _=2moE0 (9) with i ¼ 1, 2 for the triangle and hEZjQ2 vjEZi0 ¼ 3J02 E=m2o4 E þ _=2moE, (10) with Z ¼ u, v for the tetrahedron.
Because the signs of the expected values of Q2 and Qu depend on the spin-states through sz in Eqs.
(7) and (8), the clusters distort into different shapes depending on the spin- states although they remain degenerate.
The expected values of the squared displacement Q2 1 þ Q2 2 and Q2 u þ Q2 v are, respectively, 3J02 E0=m2o4 E0 þ _=moE0 and 6J02 E=m2o4 E þ _=moE; which are twice that by the static model due to quantum ﬂuctuation, apart from the zero-point terms.
Then, the change in energy by the dynamical model is twice that by static model by the virial theorem.
On the other hand, the sum of squared expectation values is equal to that by the static model, Eqs. (3) and (4).
The quantum ﬂuctuation contributes to reduce energy.
As shown above, the behaviors of the triangle and tetrahedron are completely similar to each other because the normal modes of the T2 symmetry for tetrahedron do not couple with spin in the ground spin-states.
The breathing A ðTdÞ and A0 1 ðD3hÞ modes couple with excited spin-states.
The E ðTdÞ and E0 ðD3hÞ modes distort the clusters in the ground spin-state.
The Qv and Q1 components ﬂuctuate and are smeared out.
The signs of distortions by the Qu and Q2 depend on the spin-states because the sign of spin correlations in the Eu and Ev spin-states for the tetrahedron or in the E0 1 and E0 2 spin-states for the triangle are opposite to each other as seen from Figs. 1 and 2.
Let us consider mechanism for the tetragonal distortion at the nonmagnetic phase transition in the spin-1 spinels [8–10].
Yamashita and Ueda [5] considered by breaking up the tetrahedron in pyrochlore lattice into tetramer of spin- 1 2.
The static distortion was obtained by the spin-driven Jahn–Teller effect.
By the present dynamical model, the distortion of Qu emerges as a result of ﬂuctuation of Qv.
