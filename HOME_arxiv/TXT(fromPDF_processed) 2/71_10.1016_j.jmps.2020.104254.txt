A phase ﬁeld formulation for dissolution-driven stress corrosion cracking Chuanjie Cuia, Rujin Maa,∗, Emilio Mart´ınez-Pa˜nedab aCollege of Civil Engineering, Tongji University, 200092, Shanghai, China bDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK Abstract We present a new theoretical and numerical framework for modelling mechanically- assisted corrosion in elastic-plastic solids.
Both pitting and stress corro- sion cracking (SCC) can be captured, as well as the pit-to-crack transition.
Localised corrosion is assumed to be dissolution-driven and a formulation grounded upon the ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation mechanism is pre- sented to incorporate the inﬂuence of ﬁlm passivation.
The model incor- porates, for the ﬁrst time, the role of mechanical straining as the electro- chemical driving force, accelerating corrosion kinetics.
The computational complexities associated with tracking the evolving metal-electrolyte interface are resolved by making use of a phase ﬁeld paradigm, enabling an accurate approximation of complex SCC morphologies.
The coupled electro-chemo- mechanical formulation is numerically implemented using the ﬁnite element method and an implicit time integration scheme; displacements, phase ﬁeld order parameter and concentration are the primary variables.

By modelling these paradigmatic 2D and 3D boundary value problems we show that our formulation can capture: (i) the transition from activation-controlled corrosion to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion, (ii) the sensitivity of interface kinetics to mechanical stresses and strains, (iii) the role of ﬁlm passivation in reducing corrosion rates, and (iv) the dependence of the stability of the passive ﬁlm to local strain rates.
The inﬂuence of these factors in driving the shape change of SCC defects, in- cluding the pit-to-crack transition, is a natural outcome of the model, laying the foundations for a mechanistic assessment of engineering materials and structures.

Introduction The reliability and structural integrity of materials are generally governed by their interaction with the environment and the multi-physics phenomena resulting from those interactions.
Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is one of these phenomena, arguably the most common yet complex failure mechanism of engineering structures and components (Turnbull, 2001).
SCC involves the propagation of cracks due to the combined action of mechanical stresses and the environment.
It is often facilitated by pre-existing defects, such as cor- 2rosion pits, and takes place in a broad range of metallic materials and envi- ronments (Raja and Shoji, 2011).
However, and despite decades of intensive research, the underlying physical mechanisms governing SCC are still not well understood (Turnbull, 1993; Crane and Gangloﬀ, 2016).
A number of mechanistic interpretations have been presented, and models can be classiﬁed into two categories.
The ﬁrst one refers to models and mechanisms where crack propagation is driven by the anodic corrosion reaction at the crack tip, including the active path dissolution model (Parkins, 1996) or models grounded on the ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation (FRDR) mechanism (Scully, 1975, 1980; Andresen and Ford, 1988).
The second category in- cludes models where crack growth is cathodic-driven and associated with the ingress and transport of hydrogen, such as the hydrogen-enhanced decohe- sion (HEDE) mechanism (Oriani, 1972; Serebrinsky et al., 2004; Kristensen et al., 2020), hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) (Sofronis and Birnbaum, 1995) or adsorption-induced dislocation emission (AIDE) (Lynch, 1988).
The characteristics of SCC can vary signiﬁcantly from one material to another, or even between diﬀerent environments within the same material, hindering a critical evaluation of the diﬀerent mechanistic interpretations.
Moreover, many of these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and could be acting in concert.
The development of predictive models for SCC is not only hindered by the complexity of the physical picture but also by the challenges associ- ated with encapsulating into a numerical framework the diﬀerent physics of the problem (diﬀusion, electrochemistry, mechanics).
It is particularly 3challenging from a mathematical and computational perspective to capture how the metal-electrolyte interface evolves over time.
SCC failures typically involve the growth of multiple pits, a pit-to-crack transition stage and the propagation of one or multiple cracks (Larrosa et al., 2018).
Capturing the complex morphologies resulting from this three-stage process is not an easy task and typically requires deﬁning moving interfacial boundary conditions and manually adjusting the interface topology with arbitrary criteria when merging or division occurs.
Numerical methods have been developed to cap- ture the moving boundary problem of localised corrosion; these include the eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) (Duddu et al., 2016), Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) techniques (Sun et al., 2014) and peridynamics (Chen and Bobaru, 2015).
However, progress is often limited by the inability to deal with arbitrary 3D geometries, cumbersome implementations or the computational cost.
An alternative approach is the use of the phase ﬁeld method, which is revolutionising the modelling of moving boundaries and interfacial problems.
In the phase ﬁeld paradigm, the boundary conditions at an interface are replaced by a diﬀerential equation for the evolution of an auxiliary (phase) ﬁeld φ.
This phase ﬁeld takes two distinct values in each of the phases (e.g., 0 and 1), with a smooth change between both values in a diﬀuse region near the interface.
The problem can then be solved by integrating a set of partial diﬀerential equations for the whole system, thus avoiding the explicit treatment of the interface conditions.
First proposed in the context of solidiﬁcation and micro-structure evolution, phase ﬁeld meth- ods are ﬁnding ever-expanding applications (Biner, 2017), including areas such as fracture mechanics (Bourdin et al., 2000; Tann´e et al., 2018; Hir- 4shikesh et al., 2019) or fatigue damage (Lo et al., 2019; Carrara et al., 2020; Kristensen and Mart´ınez-Pa˜neda, 2020).
Very recently, phase ﬁeld models have been developed for environmentally-assisted material degradation, in- cluding the propagation of cracks assisted by hydrogen (Mart´ınez-Pa˜neda et al., 2018; Anand et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020) and the evolution of the aqueous electrolyte-metal interface due to material dissolution (St˚ahle and Hansen, 2015; Mai et al., 2016; Mai and Soghrati, 2017; Toshniwal, 2019; Gao et al., 2020).
In addition, recent works have coupled the concepts of phase ﬁeld evolution due to fracture and material dissolution (Nguyen et al., 2017a,b, 2018).
In this work, we develop a new phase ﬁeld formulation for simulating pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking.
The model builds upon the FRDR mechanism and incorporates the role of mechanics in driving inter- face kinetics and local ﬁlm breakage.
The predictive capabilities of the model are demonstrated by addressing a number of relevant 2D and 3D problems, including several for which analytical or experimental data exist - a remark- able agreement is observed.
The remainder of this manuscript is organised as follows.
The theoretical framework presented is described in Section 2.
De- tails of the ﬁnite element implementation are given in Section 3.
In Section 4 model predictions are benchmarked against analytical solutions and rele- vant experimental measurements; practical case studies are also addressed to demonstrate the ability of the model in tackling complex engineering prob- lems.
Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5. 52.
Theory In this Section we formulate our coupled deformation-diﬀusion-material dissolution theory.
First, the key mechanistic assumptions are presented.
We proceed then to develop our theory using the principle of virtual work.
Subsequently, the governing equations for our theory are formulated, as dic- tated by the coupled ﬁeld equations, the free-energy imbalance and a set of thermodynamically-consistent constitutive equations. 2.1.
Phase ﬁeld FRDR model Our formulation aims at capturing the process of ﬁlm rupture, dissolution and repassivation.
Metals and alloys exposed to conditions of passivation are protected by a nm-size impermeable ﬁlm of metal oxides and hydroxides that eﬀectively isolates the material from the corrosive environment (Macdonald, 1999).
Independently of the speciﬁc cracking mechanism, ﬁlm-rupture is a necessary condition for localised damage in these conditions.
Also, a poten- tial rationale for pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking is the rupture of the ﬁlm due to mechanical straining, followed by localised dissolution of the metal (Scully, 1980; Jivkov, 2004).
Repassivation follows each local ﬁlm rupture event, with the new ﬁlm being deposited on the bare metal under zero-strain conditions.
Further input of mechanical work is thus needed to fracture the new ﬁlm, in a cyclic process governed by the competition be- tween ﬁlming and mechanical straining kinetics.
6Time, Current  Density, Passive Film Figure 1: Schematic illustration of two cycles of the ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation (FRDR) mechanism at the tip of a defect.
As sketched in Fig. 1, the enhanced corrosion protection resulting from the development of a passive ﬁlm is characterised by a drop in the corrosion current density i, relative to the corrosion current density associated with bare metal i0.
After a drop time tf, a ﬁlm rupture event takes place and the bare metal current density i0 is immediately recovered.
This is followed by a time interval t0, during which the current ﬂows before decay begins, such that ti = t0 + tf represents one ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation cycle.
Following common assumptions in the literature (Parkins, 1987), the mechanical work required to achieve ﬁlm rupture can be characterised using an eﬀective plastic strain quantity, εp, such that ﬁlm rupture will take place when the accumulation of the eﬀective plastic strain over a FRDR interval εp i equals a critical quantity: εp i = εf with εp i = Z ti 0 ˙εp dt (1) where ˙εp is the eﬀective plastic strain rate and εf is the critical strain for ﬁlm 7rupture, which is on the order of 0.1% (Gutman, 2007).
Thus, the duration of each ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation cycle, and the magnitude of tf, will be dictated by the local values of the equivalent plastic strain and their evolution in time.
We proceed to deﬁne the degradation of the current density as an exponential function of the time.
Thus, during one rupture- dissolution-repassivation cycle, i(ti) can be expressed as: i(ti) =    i0, if 0 < ti ⩽t0 i0 exp (−k (ti −t0)), if t0 < ti ⩽t0 + tf (2) where k is a parameter that characterises the sensitivity of the corrosion rates to the stability of the passive ﬁlm, as dictated by the material and the environment.
The role of mechanical stresses and strains is typically restricted to the ﬁlm rupture event.
However, we here consider recent experimental evidence that suggests a further inﬂuence of mechanical straining, accelerating cor- rosion.
For example, in Dai et al. (2020) localised corrosion is observed in Q345R steel despite the negligible eﬀect of the passive ﬁlm in the hydroﬂu- oric acid environment considered.
Also, as pointed out by Gutman (2007), localised corrosion rates can be notably accelerated by the inﬂuence of resid- ual stresses.
Thus, we enhance the deﬁnition of the corrosion current density by considering a mechanochemical term km (Gutman, 1998) as: ia(t) = km (εp, σh) i(ti) = εp εy + 1  exp σhVm RT  i(ti) (3) where ia is the mechanochemical corrosion current density, εp is the eﬀective plastic strain, εy is the yield strain, σh is the hydrostatic stress, Vm is the 8molar volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
We emphasise that km is a local variable, a function of the local εp and σh magnitudes.
Localised corrosion can be diﬀusion-controlled or activation-controlled.
In the latter, the velocity of the moving pit boundary Γ follows Faraday’s second law, vn = v · n = ia zFcsolid (4) where n is the unit normal vector to the pit interface, F is Faraday’s constant, z is the average charge number and csolid is the concentration of atoms in the metal.
Then, the concentration of dissolved ions cm(x, t) at a point x in the interface can be calculated according to the Rankine–Hugoniot condition as, [D∇cm + (cm(x, t) −csolid) v] · n = 0 (5) where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
On the other hand, corrosion becomes diﬀusion controlled when the sur- face concentration reaches the saturation concentration csat, due to the ac- cumulation of metal ions along the pit boundary.
The pit interface velocity becomes then controlled by the diﬀusion of metal ions away from the pit boundary and the moving pit boundary velocity can be obtained by consid- ering a saturated concentration in (5), such that vn = D∇cm · n csolid −csat (6) Modelling the moving pit interface requires the application of both Robin (5) and Dirichlet (cm = csat) boundary conditions for the activation-controlled 9and diﬀusion-controlled processes, respectively.
Instead, we circumvent these complications by following the phase ﬁeld paradigm proposed by Mai et al. (2016), approximating the interface evolution implicitly by solving for an aux- iliary variable φ.
As shown in Fig. 2, the phase ﬁeld takes values of φ = 0 for the electrolyte and φ = 1 for the metal, varying smoothly between these two values along the interface Γ. Also, for consistency, a normalised concen- tration is deﬁned as c = cm/csolid (Mai et al., 2016).
Thus, the normalised concentration c will equal 1 in the metal (solid) phase, and will approach 0 with increasing distance from the metal-electrolyte interface.

Principle of virtual work and balance equations Our theory deals with the coupled behaviour of two systems, one me- chanical and one electrochemical one, see Fig. 2.
These two systems are 10coupled by the following physical phenomena: (i) the pit evolution process is accelerated by mechanics, as presented in Eqs.
(2) and (3); and (ii) the disso- lution of metals leads to a redistribution of mechanical stress.
With respect to the mechanical contributions, the outer surface of the body is decomposed into a part ∂Ωu, where the displacement can be prescribed by Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, and a part ∂ΩT, where a traction T can be prescribed by Neumann-type boundary conditions.
As for the electrochemical part, the external surface consists on two parts: ∂Ωq where the ﬂux J is known (Neumman-type boundary conditions), and ∂Ωc, where the concentration is prescribed (Dirichlet-type boundary conditions).
Accordingly, a concentra- tion ﬂux entering the body across ∂Ωq can be deﬁned as q = J · n. Solute diﬀusion is driven by the chemical potential µ, as constitutively characterised below.
We follow Duda et al. (2018) in deﬁning a scalar ﬁeld η to determine the kinematics of composition changes, such that ˙η = µ and η(x, t) = Z t 0 µ(x, t) dt (7) Thus, from a kinematic viewpoint, the domain Ωcan be described by the displacement u, phase parameter φ and chemical displacement η.
We denote the set of virtual ﬁelds as (δu, δφ, δη) and proceed to introduce the principle of virtual work for the coupled systems as, Z Ω  σ : δε + 1 L dφ dt δφ + ωδφ + ζ · ∇δφ −dc dtcsolid δη + J · ∇δη  dV = Z ∂Ω {fδφ + qδη + T · δu} dS (8) where ε is the strain tensor, which is computed from the displacement ﬁeld in the usual manner ε = sym∇u and additively decomposes into an elastic 11part εe and a plastic part εp.
Also, we use L to denote the interface kinetics coeﬃcient, f is the phase ﬁeld microtraction and ω and ζ are the microstress quantities work conjugate to the phase ﬁeld φ and the phase ﬁeld gradient ∇φ, respectively.
Operating, and making use of Gauss’ divergence theorem: Z Ω  (∇· σ) · δu +  ∇· ζ −ω −1 L dφ dt  δφ +  ∇· J + dc dtcsolid  δη  dV = Z ∂Ω {(σn −T ) · δu + (ζ · n −f) δφ + (J · n −q) δη} dS (9) Finally, considering that the left-hand side of Eq. (9) must vanish for ar- bitrary variations, the equilibrium equations in Ωfor each primary kinematic variable are obtained as ∇· σ = 0 (∇· ζ −ω) −1 L dφ dt = 0 dc dtcsolid + ∇· J = 0 (10) with the right-hand side of Eq. (9) providing the corresponding set of bound- ary conditions on ∂Ω, T = σ · n f = ζ · n q = J · n (11) 2.3.
Energy imbalance The ﬁrst two laws of thermodynamics for a continuum body within a dynamical process of speciﬁc internal energy E and speciﬁc entropy Λ read 12(Gurtin et al., 2010), d dt Z Ω E dV = ˙We (Ω) − Z ∂Ω Q · n dS + Z Ω Q dV d dt Z Ω Λ dV ⩾− Z ∂Ω Q T · n dS + Z Ω Q T dV (12) where ˙We is the power of external work, Q is the heat ﬂux and Q is the heat absorption.
The resulting Clausius-Duhem inequality must be fulﬁlled by the free energies associated with both systems, mechanical ψM and electro- chemical ψE.
Thus, the energy imbalances associated with the mechanical and electrochemical systems can be obtained by assuming an isothermal pro- cess (T = T0) and replacing the virtual ﬁelds (δu, δφ, δη) by the realizable velocity ﬁelds  ˙u, ˙φ, µ  in Eq. (8), d dt Z Ω ψM dV ⩽ Z ∂Ω T · ˙u dS (13) d dt Z Ω ψE dV ⩽ Z ∂Ω  f ˙φ + qµ  dS (14) Employing the divergence theorem and recalling the local balance equa- tions (10)-(11), we ﬁnd the equivalent point-wise version of Eqs.
(13)-(14) as, ˙ψM −σ : ˙ε ⩽0 (15) ˙ψE −1 L ¨φ −ω ˙φ −ζ · ∇˙φ + µ˙c csolid −J · ∇µ ⩽0 (16) 2.4.
Constitutive theory We proceed to deﬁne the functional form of free energy of each system and subsequently derive a set of thermodynamically consistent relations. 132.4.1.
Constitutive prescriptions for the mechanical problem The mechanical behaviour of the solid is characterised by von Mises J2 plasticity theory.
The extension to strain gradient plasticity (Mart´ınez- Pa˜neda and Fleck, 2019; Mart´ınez-Pa˜neda et al., 2019), of particular impor- tance when dealing with sharp pits and cracks, will be addressed in future works.
Accordingly, the mechanical free energy is decomposed into elastic ψe and plastic ψp components, both of which are degraded by the phase ﬁeld, ψM = h(φ) (ψe + ψp) (17) Here, h(φ) is the degradation function characterising the transition from the undissolved solid (φ = 1) to the electrolyte phase (φ = 0).
The deﬁnition of h(φ) must satisfy the conditions h(φ = 0) = 0 and h(φ = 1) = 1; here, h (φ) = −2φ3 + 3φ2 (18) Consistent with (15), the Cauchy stress tensor is deﬁned as σ = ∂εψM and we denote σ0 as the Cauchy stress tensor for the undissolved solid.
Thus, accounting for the inﬂuence of the phase ﬁeld and using σ0, the mechanical force balance (10a) can be reformulated as, ∇· [(h (φ) + κ) σ0] = 0 (19) where κ is a small positive parameter introduced to circumvent the complete degradation of the energy and ensure that the algebraic conditioning number remains well-posed.
We adopt κ = 1 × 10−7 throughout this work.
The elastic strain energy density is deﬁned as a function of the elastic 14strains εe and the linear elastic stiﬀness matrix C0 in the usual manner, ψe (εe) = 1 2 (εe)T : C0 : εe (20) While the plastic strain energy density is incrementally computed from the plastic strain tensor εp and the Cauchy stress tensor for the undissolved solid σ0 as, ψp = Z t 0 σ0 : ˙εp dt (21) Finally, the material work hardening is deﬁned assuming an isotropic power law hardening behaviour.
Such that the ﬂow stress σ and the eﬀective plastic strain εp are related by, σ = σy  1 + Eεp σy N (22) where E is Young’s modulus, σy is the yield stress and N is the strain hard- ening exponent (0 ⩽N ⩽1). 2.4.2.
Constitutive prescriptions for the electrochemical problem In the localised corrosion system described in Section 1, the electrochemi- cal free energy density ψE can be decomposed into its chemical and interface counterparts, ψE = ψch + ψi (23) The chemical free energy density ψch can be further decomposed into the energy associated with material composition and a double-well potential energy (Mai et al., 2016), such that ψch = h (φ) ψch S + (1 −h(φ)) ψch L + wg (φ) (24) 15where the parameter w is the height of the double well potential g (φ) = φ2(1 −φ)2, and ψch S and ψch L denote the chemical free energy density terms associated with the solid and liquid phases, respectively.
These latter two terms are deﬁned following the KKS model (Kim et al., 1999), which as- sumes that each material point is a mixture of both solid and liquid phases with diﬀerent concentrations but similar chemical potentials.
Following this assumption, one reaches the following balances c = h (φ) cS + [1 −h (φ)] cL (25) ∂ψch S (cS) ∂cS = ∂ψch L (cL) ∂cL (26) where cS and cL are the normalized concentrations of the co-existing solid and liquid phases, respectively.
Deﬁning a free energy density curvature A, assumed to be similar for the solid and liquid phases, and restricting our attention to dilute solutions, we reach the following deﬁnitions for each component of the chemical free energy density, ψch S = A(cS −cSe)2 and ψch L = A(cL −cLe)2 (27) where cSe = csolid/csolid = 1 and cLe = csat/csolid are the normalised equilibrium concentrations for the solid and liquid phases. Combining Eqs.
(24)-(27) renders, ψch = A [c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe]2 + wφ2 (1 −φ)2 (28) On the other hand, the interface free energy density ψi is deﬁned as a function of the gradient of the phase ﬁeld variable as: ψi = α 2 |∇φ|2 (29) 16where α is the gradient energy coeﬃcient.
In the free energy density deﬁni- tions (28)-(29), the parameters α and w govern the interface energy γ and its thickness l as: γ = √αw 4 and l = a∗ r 2α w (30) where a∗= 2.94 is a constant parameter corresponding to the deﬁnition of the interface region 0.05 < φ < 0.95 (Abubakar et al., 2015).
The results are sensitive to the choices of γ and l, which characterise the energy barrier that separates the free energy of the coexisting phases.
Finally, the constitutive relations for the associated stress quantities can be readily obtained by fulﬁlling the free energy imbalance (16), which implies −1 L ¨φ+ ∂ψE ∂φ −ω  ˙φ+  ∂ψE ∂∇φ −ζ  ·∇˙φ+ ∂ψE ∂c + µcsolid  ˙c−J · ∇µ ⩽0 (31) Thus, the scalar microstress ω, work conjugate to the phase ﬁeld φ, is given by ω = ∂ψE ∂φ = −2A [c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe] (cSe −cLe)h′(φ) + wg′(φ) (32) while the vector microstress ζ, work conjugate to the phase ﬁeld gradient, reads ζ = ∂ψE ∂∇φ = α∇φ (33) Inserting these constitutive relations (32)-(33) into the phase ﬁeld balance (10b) renders the so-called Allen-Cahn equation: dφ dt + L ∂ψE ∂φ −α∇2φ  = 0 (34) 17Eq. (34) shows that material dissolution is governed by the interface kinetics coeﬃcient L.
The magnitude of L can be considered to be a constant positive number (see, e.g., Mai et al., 2016).
Here, we assume a time-dependent L in- stead, enriching the modelling capabilities by establishing a relation with our FRDR mechanistic interpretation and our deﬁnition of a mechanochemically- enhanced corrosion current density ia(ti). Thus, from Eqs.
(2)-(3) and as- suming a linear relationship between L and ia, the interface kinetics coeﬃ- cient over a time interval ti is deﬁned as L =    km (εp, σh) L0, if 0 < ti ⩽t0 km (εp, σh) L0 exp (−k (ti −t0)), if t0 < ti ⩽t0 + tf (35) We emphasise that the interface kinetics coeﬃcient L includes the inﬂuence of mechanical straining via km (εp, σh), and that this is a one-way coupling in that, while φ reduces the material stiﬀness, there is no L-dependent term in the mechanical problem.
Also, we stress that the mechanical free energy density ψM does not contribute to the phase ﬁeld evolution, see (34).
In other words, crack advance takes place due to localised metal loss, as postu- lated by the slip-dissolution model (see, e.g., Turnbull, 1993).
The framework could be extended to incorporate other cracking mechanisms that include a contribution from ψM; for example, using a coupled framework such as that by Nguyen et al. (2017b).
The material dissolution process (pitting and cracking) can be either activation-controlled or diﬀusion-controlled, as it will be illustrated in our ﬁrst case study - Section 4.1.
The constitutive choices for the mass transport 18process are obtained as follows.
First, the chemical potential is given by, µ = −1 csolid ∂ψE ∂c = −2A csolid ((c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe)) (36) Secondly, the ﬂux J can be determined following a Fick law-type relation as, J = D 2A · csolid · csolid · ∇µ = −csolid · D∇((c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe)) (37) Substituting Eqs.
(36)-(37) into the mass transport balance Eq. (10c), the following ﬁeld equation is obtained dc dt −∇· D∇((c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe)) = 0 (38) which is an extension of Fick’s second law such that diﬀusion of metal ions only takes place along the interface and in the electrolyte. 3.
Numerical implementation The ﬁnite element method is used to discretise and solve the coupled electro-chemo-mechanical problem.
First, we formulate the weak form of the governing equations for the displacement (19), phase ﬁeld (34), and concen- tration (38) problems, respectively.
Thus, Z Ω (h(φ) + κ) σ0δε dV − Z ∂Ω T · δu dS = 0 (39) Z Ω ∂φ ∂t δφ dV + L Z Ω ∂ψE ∂φ δφ dV + L Z Ω α∇φ∇δφ dV = 0 (40) Z Ω ∂c ∂tδc dV + D Z Ω ∇[c −h(φ)(cSe −cLe) −cLe] · ∇δc dV = 0 (41) 19Using Voigt notation, the nodal variables for the displacement ﬁeld ˆu, the phase ﬁeld ˆφ and the normalised concentration ˆc are interpolated as: u = m X i=1 Nu i ˆui, φ = m X i=1 Ni ˆφi, c = m X i=1 Niˆci (42) where Ni denotes the shape function associated with node i, for a total num- ber of nodes m.
Here, Nu i is a diagonal interpolation matrix with the nodal shape functions Ni as components.
Similarly, using the standard strain- displacement B matrices, the associated gradient quantities are discretised as: ε = m X i=1 Bu i ˆui, ∇φ = m X i=1 Bi ˆφi, ∇c = m X i=1 Biˆci (43) Then, the weak form balances (39)-(41) are discretised in time and space, such that the resulting discrete equations of the balances for the displace- ment, phase ﬁeld and concentration can be expressed as the following resid- uals: rn+1 i,u = Z Ω  h(φn+1) + κ  (Bu i )Tσ0 dV − Z ∂Ω (Nu i )TT dS (44) rn+1 i,φ = Z Ω φn+1 −φn dt Ni dV + L Z Ω ∂ψE ∂φn+1Ni dV + L Z Ω αBi T∇φn+1 dV (45) rn+1 i,c = Z Ω cn+1 −cn dt Ni dV + D Z Ω Bi T  ∇cn+1 −h′(φn+1)(cSe −cLe)∇φn+1 dV (46) where ()n+1 denotes the (n + 1) time step and dt is the time increment.
Subsequently, the tangent stiﬀness matrices are calculated as: Kn+1 ij,u = Z Ω  h(φn+1) + kp  (Bu i )TCepBu j dV (47) 20Kn+1 ij,φ = Z Ω NiNj dt dV + L Z Ω ∂2ψE ∂φ2 NiNj dV + L Z Ω αBi TBj dV (48) Kn+1 ij,c = Z Ω NiNj dt dV + D Z Ω Bi TBj dV (49) where Cep is the elastic-plastic consistent material Jacobian.
Finally, the linearized ﬁnite element system can be expressed as:   Ku 0 0 0 Kφ 0 0 0 Kc     u φ c  =   ru rφ rc   (50) We solve the ﬁnite element system by means of a time parametrization and an incremental-iterative scheme in conjunction with the Newton–Raphson method.
Good convergence is achieved without the need for staggered schemes; the residual and stiﬀness matrix components are built using current values and all the equations of the system are solved at once.
The numerical model is implemented in the ﬁnite element package ABAQUS by means of a user ele- ment subroutine (UEL) and Abaqus2Matlab (Papazafeiropoulos et al., 2017) is used for pre-processing the input ﬁles.
The code, with examples and accom- panied documentation, can be downloaded from www.empaneda.com/codes. 4.
Results We proceed to showcase the potential of the model in predicting localised corrosion with ﬁve case studies of particular interest.
First, in Section 4.1, we validate our predictions with analytical solutions in the context of a pure cor- rosion problem, the classic benchmark of the pencil electrode test.
Secondly, the predictions of the model are compared with experimental measurements 21of anodic dissolution-driven defect growth in a C-ring test, see Section 4.2.
The inﬂuence of mechanical contributions in accelerating and governing the pit-to-crack transition in stainless steel is addressed in Section 4.3.
Then, the interaction between multiple pits is investigated in Section 4.4 by modelling SCC in a steel plate with pre-existing defects.
And ﬁnally, the capabilities of the model in conducting large scale 3D simulations of pit corrosion are showcased in Section 4.5. 4.1.
Analytical veriﬁcation under uniform corrosion: pencil electrode test The paradigmatic benchmark of a pencil electrode test is addressed ﬁrst.
This boundary value problem enables validating the numerical framework under pure corrosion conditions, as no mechanical load is applied and no ﬁlm passivation takes place.
The specimen, a H=150 µm long metal wire with diameter d= 25 µm, is mounted into an epoxy coating, leaving only one end of the sample exposed to the solution - see Fig. 3.
Thus, the problem is essentially one-dimensional and can be described by the change in time of the position of the metal-electrolyte interface xd.
22H x d epoxy metal solution Figure 3: Schematic illustration of the pencil electrode test, including the initial and boundary conditions deﬁned in the phase ﬁeld model.
The evolution of the pit depth xd can be estimated analytically (Scheiner and Hellmich, 2007), and is found to be proportional to √ t as, xd = 2ξd √ Dt (51) where the unknown ξd is given by: csat csolid −csat exp  −ξ2 d  = √πξd erf (ξd) (52) A proportional dependency of the pit depth on √ t is also observed ex- perimentally (Ernst and Newman, 2002).
In both the experiments and the analytical study, corrosion is assumed to be diﬀusion-controlled; this can be achieved by using a suﬃciently large applied potential such that reaction rates are high and the surface concentration reaches a saturation magnitude.
Using the phase ﬁeld method, the pencil electrode test can be conveniently 23modelled without the need of prescribing a moving cm = csat Dirichlet bound- ary condition at the interface (Mai et al., 2016).
Thus, as described in Fig. 3 we assign as initial conditions φ = 1 and c = 1 in the metallic wire and prescribe the Dirichlet boundary conditions φ = 0 and c = 0 at the pit mouth throughout the numerical experiment.
Neumann boundary conditions J = 0 and f = 0 are considered at the sides, to simulate the insulation provided by the epoxy coating.
The interface kinetics coeﬃcient is assumed to be constant L = L0, as there is no mechanical straining or protective ﬁlm.
Fol- lowing Mai et al. (2016) and Gao et al. (2020), we consider the material and corrosion parameters shown in Table 1; the values listed for the interface thickness l and the interface energy γ result from the choices of a gradient energy coeﬃcient α = 4.8 × 10−5 N and a height of double well potential w = 33.3 N/mm2, see (30).
A uniform ﬁnite element mesh is used, with a characteristic element size 10 times smaller than the interface thickness and employing a total of 15,000 quadratic quadrilateral plane strain elements.
The contours of the phase ﬁeld φ and the normalised concentration c are given in Fig. 4.
Results are shown for two time instants, 38 and 152 s, showing how the metal corrodes and the metal-electrolyte evolves.
Fig. 4a shows that the normalised concentration increases from 0 at the pit mouth to csat/csolid = 0.036 at the metal-electrolyte interface; the model captures how a further increase in the pit surface concentration is prevented as saturation occurs.

The predictions of the model are quantitatively veriﬁed against the an- 25alytical solution (51)-(52).
As shown in Fig. 5, an excellent agreement is attained in the calculation of the evolution of the pit depth as a function of √ t.
The results obtained also coincide with the numerical predictions by Mai et al. (2016) and Gao et al. (2020), further validating our numerical implementation.

Comparison of model predictions for pit depth versus time against analytical results (Scheiner and Hellmich, 2007).
We proceed to showcase the capabilities of the model in capturing both diﬀusion-controlled and activation-controlled corrosion.
In the pencil elec- trode test, the corrosion rate is directly controlled by a non-transient pa- 26rameter L = L0.
If L0 is suﬃciently high, as in Figs. 4 and 5 (Table 1), the process is diﬀusion-controlled, with the electrochemical reaction at the metal-electrolyte interface occurring very fast and leading to saturation in the surface concentration of metal ions.
On the other hand, if L0 is small, then the corrosion process is activation-controlled and the pit depth shows a linear dependence with time.
For a given time instant, e.g. t = 150 s, one can readily see that increasing the interface kinetics coeﬃcient raises the magnitude of the pit depth, but this sensitivity to L0 is non-linear and sat- urates as L0 increases; for a suﬃciently large value of L0, further increasing its magnitude has no eﬀect on the corrosion kinetics.
Corrosion becomes then diﬀusion-limited and a higher value of D should be adopted to increase dissolution rates.
Model predictions of pit growth versus time as a function of the interface kinetics parameter are shown in Fig. 6a, exhibiting a linear to parabolic trend with increasing L0.
The pit depth evolution is also computed for a large interface kinetics parameter, L0 = 2 × 106 mm2/(N · s), and selected values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, see Fig. 6b.
As expected, the corrosion reaction exhibits a signiﬁcant sensitivity to the magnitude of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
As the inﬂuence of mechanical straining and ﬁlm re-passivation and rupture are incorporated, the magnitude of L will evolve in time and the transition from activation-controlled to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion will be captured by the model.

Chemo-mechanical validation with experiments: C-ring test on Q345R steel We now verify our model by reproducing the experimental observations by Dai et al. (2020) on C-ring specimens.
Q345R steel samples were ex- posed to a hydroﬂuoric acid corrosion environment and the growth of pits and associated cracks was quantiﬁed for diﬀerent levels of applied mechani- cal stress.
This choice of environment translates into a negligible inﬂuence of ﬁlm passivation, as the corrosion products are mainly ﬂuorides (not oxides) and the ﬁlm is not dense enough to prevent the attack of aggressive ions (Dai et al., 2020).
The applied strain is held constant throughout the exper- iment and thus the sensitivity of defect growth rates to mechanical stresses can be quantiﬁed.
This boundary value problem enables us to validate the chemo-mechanical coupling introduced in our formulation to characterise the interplay between mechanics and corrosion kinetics, see Eq. (3).
Note that the sensitivity of corrosion rates to applied stresses cannot be captured with conventional SCC models that restrict the inﬂuence of mechanical straining to the local ﬁlm breakage mechanism (see, e.g., Mai and Soghrati, 2017).
The conﬁguration of the experiment is shown in Fig. 7.
The sample is subjected to a constant strain by tightening a bolt centred in the diameter of the ring.
The load level is characterised by the circumferential stress at the top of the sample, the region where localised corrosion will develop.
Thus, the magnitude of the circumferential stress σc is determined by placing a strain gauge in the middle of the arc, close to the extreme edge; i.e., in the vicinity of point A, see Fig. 7.
The C-ring specimens were exposed to 40 29wt.% hydroﬂuoric acid under room temperature conditions and, using 3D optical microscopy, surface morphologies were characterised as a function of the stress level and the time (Dai et al., 2020).
SCC region A Figure 7: Schematic description of the C-ring SCC test including the geometry, ﬁnite element mesh, boundary conditions and dimensions.
In the ﬁnite element model we discretise the domain between the two bolt holes.
As shown in Fig. 7, the sample has an inner diameter of 20 mm and an outer diameter of 25 mm.
The vertical and horizontal displacements are constrained at the left side, while a Dirichlet boundary condition is used to prescribe the horizontal displacement component of the right side, where the bolt is tightened.
The load is prescribed at the beginning of the analysis and then held ﬁxed throughout the calculation.
The resulting circumferen- tial stress is measured at the top of the sample (point A), to resemble the experimental measurements.
In agreement with the experimental work, we consider a Young’s modulus of E = 200 GPa, a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.3 and a yield stress of σy = 535 MPa for the Q345R steel.
No stress-strain curve or strain hardening exponent is provided in (Dai et al., 2020), a value of N = 0.073 is adopted based on the Q345R material characterisation by 30Liang et al. (2019).
The material properties are listed in Table 2.

Parameter Value Unit Young’s modulus E 200,000 MPa Poisson’s ratio ν 0.25 — Yield stress σy 535 MPa Strain hardening exponent N 0.073 — In regard to the corrosion parameters, those listed in Table 1 are used unless otherwise stated.
Since no ﬁlm passivation is involved, we deﬁne k = 0 in Eq. (35).
The initial interface kinetics coeﬃcient L0 is chosen so as to pro- vide the best ﬁt to the experimental data; here, L0 = 4.7×10−5 mm2/(N · s).
The interface thickness is taken to be l = 0.05 mm and the ﬁnite element mesh is reﬁned in the SCC region accordingly, with the characteristic element size being equal or smaller than 0.005 mm.
A total of 10,681 quadrilateral quadratic elements are used.
As shown in Fig. 8, several pits are observed in the experiments, with one of them becoming a particularly large crack - we aim at capturing this dominant localised corrosion defect and address later the occurrence of multiple pits and their interactions.
To trigger the dominant localised defect, the Dirichlet boundary condition φ = 0 is pre- scribed over a length of 0.05 mm in the extreme edge of the middle of the arc (point A).
The ﬁnite element results obtained in terms of SCC defect length and shape are provided in Fig. 8; the experimental measurements from Dai et al. (2020) corresponding to the same time (t =210 min) and stress level 31(σc = 0.8σy) are also shown.

Fig. 8 reveals a good agreement with experimental observations.
A quan- titative comparison with experiments for diﬀerent stress levels is provided in Fig. 9.
Results are shown in terms of the length of the SCC region, including the initial pitting and subsequent cracking, as a function of time.
A very good agreement is observed for both σc = 0.55σy and σc = 0.8σy.
We emphasise that while the circumferential stress in the middle of the arc remains below the yield stress, plasticity can develop on the surface of the SCC defects as the resulting notches and cracks act as stress concentrators.

Parametric study: cracking from a semi-elliptical pit We proceed to conduct numerical experiments on a stainless steel plate, containing a pre-existing pit, to investigate the eﬀect of both mechanical straining and repassivation on the SCC process.
The geometric setup, dimen- sions and boundary conditions are given in Fig. 10.
The Dirichlet boundary conditions φ = 0 and c = 0 are prescribed at the surface of the pre-existing defect, which has a semi-elliptical shape with radii 0.01 and 0.02 mm.
At 33t = 0, c = 1 and φ = 1 are deﬁned as initial conditions in the metallic plate, of height 0.15 mm and width of 0.3 mm.
The mechanical load is applied by prescribing a remote horizontal displacement u∞on the left and right edges of the sample, as shown in Fig. 10.
The vertical displacement of the top right corner is also constrained to prevent rigid body motion.

The corrosion parameters in this study are those assumed in the pen- cil electrode test, see Table 1, with the exception of the interface kinet- ics coeﬃcient; a magnitude of L0 = 0.001 mm2/(N · s) is adopted to ensure activation-controlled corrosion.
The constitutive behaviour of the steel plate is characterised by a Young modulus of E = 190 GPa, a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.3, an initial yield stress of σy = 520 MPa and a strain hardening exponent of N = 0.067.
Approximately 7,000 quadrilateral quadratic plane 34strain elements are used to discretise the model.
First, we consider the case of mechanics-enhanced corrosion in the absence of a passivation mechanism.
The goal is to characterise the role of mechanical straining in controlling the defect growth rate and shape.
Thus, we make k = 0 in Eq. (35) and prescribe three diﬀerent values of the remote displacement u∞= 0.02 µm, u∞= 0.1 µm and u∞= 0.125 µm.
The remote displacement u∞is prescribed at the beginning of the numerical experiment and then held ﬁxed over a total time of 900 s.
The results obtained, in terms of the phase ﬁeld and hydrostatic stress contours, are shown in Fig. 11.

Contours of (a) the phase ﬁeld and (b) hy- drostatic stress for three selected values of the initial applied displacement after t = 900 s.
The results reveal that, when the mechanical load is small (u∞= 0.02 µm), there is a negligible inﬂuence of the hydrostatic stress and the pit grows approximately the same length in all dimensions, in agreement with the cor- rosion evolution laws in the absence of mechanical contributions.
However as the remote displacement is raised and the magnitude of σh increases, the pit morphology changes and a pit-to-crack transition is observed.
The dominance of the mechanics contributions becomes very clear in the case of u∞= 0.125 µm, where the stresses are suﬃciently high to trigger plas- 36tic deformations and the shape of the SCC defect is governed by both the hydrostatic stress and the plastic strain distribution.
It is also worth empha- sising that mechanical straining not only sharpens the SCC defect but also increases its length.
The length of the SCC region is shown in Fig. 12 for the three chosen values of the applied displacement u∞. It can be seen that the mechanical contribution has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on localised corrosion rates.

Evolution in time of the SCC region for three diﬀerent mechanical loads, as characterised by the remote displacement u∞. 37We now turn our attention to the repassivation process and our ﬁlm rupture-dissolution-repassivation (FRDR) formulation.
Thus, we apply and hold ﬁxed a remote displacement of u∞= 0.1 µm and consider the sensi- tivity of the results to changes in the material parameter characterising the corrosion sensitivity to the stability of the passive ﬁlm, k - see Eq. (2) and (35).
Three representative values are considered: k = 2×10−4, k = 5×10−4, and k = 1 × 10−3; while the critical strain for ﬁlm rupture and the time interval without repassivation are held constant at εf = 3×10−3 and t0 = 10 s, respectively.

The phase ﬁeld contours obtained after 900 s are shown in Fig. 13.
The impact of k in the SCC morphology is evident; higher k values accelerate the SCC defect growth rate in the pit base relative to corrosion rates at the pit mouth, sharpening the pit and triggering a pit-to-crack transition.
Corrosion rates at the tip of the SCC defect are exacerbated as the defect sharpens and plasticity localises; the protective ﬁlm is weaker in areas of high mechanical 38straining - see Eq. (1).
The length of the SCC region is shown in Fig. 14 as a function of the ﬁlm stability parameter k, including the case where no ﬁlm is present (k = 0).
The results reveal that by introducing the repassivation process, the length of the SCC region drops slightly at an early stage, which is in accordance with the fact that repassivation will restrain the SCC process by decreasing the value of interface kinetics coeﬃcient.
After a certain time, the size of the SCC region grows faster with increasing k as ﬁlm rupture occurs and the magnitude of the equivalent plastic strain increases as the defect sharpens, augmenting the interface kinetics coeﬃcient - see Eq. (35).

Finally, we gain insight into the model predictions at the local level by quantifying the evolution the interface kinetics coeﬃcient as a function of time and space.
We compare the interface kinetics coeﬃcient L at the SCC tip to further clarify the local behaviours.
First, Fig. 15a shows the evolution in time of the normalised interface kinetics coeﬃcient L/L0 at the tip of the SCC defect for diﬀerent values of the ﬁlm stability coeﬃcient k.
The initial value of L is smaller with increasing k due to the eﬀect of ﬁlm passivation, in 40agreement with expectations.
In all cases, the magnitude of L/L0 increases with time but eventually reaches a plateau.
This indicates that mechanical straining dominates the corrosion process.
Also, it is observed that SCC damage becomes more localised as the stability of the ﬁlm k increases.
This is showcased in Fig. 15b, where the spatial contour of L/L0 is shown in the interface region.
Higher values of the interface kinetics coeﬃcient are observed at the tip of the pit, where the mechanical ﬁelds (εp, σh) are larger.

SCC driven by the interaction between multiple pits Component failure frequently takes place as a consequence of the interac- tion between multiple pits.
In this section, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model in predicting failure due to the combined action of multiple pits and their coalescence, as well as investigating the role of corrosion parameters 41in driving the evolution of neighbouring pits.
For this purpose, we model a steel plate with an inner defect (not exposed to the environment) and three pre-existing corrosion pits.
As shown in Fig. 16, one of the existing pits has a semi-ellipsoidal shape with radii 0.1 and 0.2 mm, while the other two pits have a semi-circular proﬁle and the same radius: 0.15 mm.
The mechani- cal load is applied by prescribing a remote horizontal displacement equal to u∞= 0.01 on each side of the plate.
The displacement is prescribed at the beginning of the analysis and held constant afterwards (step function).

The corrosion and material parameters considered are those listed in Ta- bles 1 and 2, respectively.
However, note that a smaller value is assumed for the interface kinetics coeﬃcient, L0 = 1 × 10−4 mm2/(N · s), so as to simu- late activation-controlled corrosion.
Also, the interface thickness is chosen to be equal to l = 0.2 mm, which is 20 times larger than the characteristic 42element size.
The plate is discretised using 27,450 quadrilateral quadratic plane strain elements with reduced integration.
In addition, the presence of a protective ﬁlm and its rupture is captured by considering a ﬁlm stability parameter k = 2 × 10−4.
The SCC process is shown as a function of time in Fig. 17, where the blue and red colours correspond to the completely corroded and intact areas, respectively.
We can see that the three pits increase in depth (Fig. 17a), with the upper two eventually branching (Fig. 17b).
The bottom pit eventually coalesces with the central circular defect (Fig. 17c), while the branches of the upper defects sharpen - one growing toward the central defect and the other one in the direction of the bottom pit.
Eventually, after approximately 4 hours, the upper and bottom pits merge and complete failure of the plate is predicted (Fig. 17d).

Phase ﬁeld contours at times (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1 h, (c) 2 h, and (d) 4 h. Blue and red colours respectively denote the electrolyte (φ = 0) and solid (φ = 1) regions.
44We also compare the SCC morphologies for three diﬀerent values of L0 to assess the inﬂuence of the interface kinetics parameter on the corrosion process.
The results are shown in Fig. 18 for a time of t=0.5 h. It can be seen that the pits grow more uniformly when the initial interface kinetics pa- rameter is higher, implying a smaller contribution of the mechanical problem with increasing L0.
Mechanical strains and stresses enhance interface kinet- ics via the mechanochemical term km (εp, σh), see (3) and (35).
However, this also implies that the mechanical contribution facilitates the transition from activation-controlled corrosion to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion, and when L is suﬃciently large such that corrosion is diﬀusion-limited, corrosion rates become independent of L (see Fig. 6a) and accordingly of km.
Consequently, for a given value of the remote load, the contribution from the mechanical problem will be larger for lower L0 magnitudes.

Three-dimensional predictions of SCC defect growth Finally, we extend our computational framework to model 3D SCC prob- lems.
The goal is to bring new insight into the mechanics of SCC de- 46fect growth and demonstrate the capabilities of our model in addressing technologically-relevant case studies.
For this purpose, we choose to model a hemispherical pit in a suﬃciently large steel plate subjected to tension, aiming to rationalise the observation of cracks initiating at the cross-section of uniaxial tension samples (Turnbull et al., 2010).
The pit, of radius 0.15 mm, has its centre located at 3 mm from the loading edge and at 1 mm along the plate thickness.
The geometry, initial and boundary conditions are given in Fig. 19.
The remote displacement, applied along the x axis, is prescribed at the beginning of the numerical experiment and is held constant throughout the analysis; its magnitude equals u∞= 0.01 mm.
The corrosion and material parameters adopted are those listed in Tables 1 and 2 with the exception of an initial kinetics coeﬃcient of L0 = 3 × 10−4 mm2/(N · s), to ensure that at t = 0+ corrosion is activation-controlled.
Also, the presence of a protective ﬁlm is considered, with k = 2 × 10−4.
The interface thickness is chosen to be l = 0.4 mm, which is 20 times larger than the characteristic element size.
A total of 356,892 10-node tetrahedral elements are used; the model contains approximately 2.5 million degrees-of-freedom (DOFs).
47x  z  y  R 0.15 mm 6 mm 2 mm 2 mm Stainless steel Figure 19: 3D pit growth study: geometry and loading conﬁguration.
The pit is a hemi- sphere located at the center of the upper surface of the plate.
The predicted evolution of the SCC defect is shown in Figs. 20 and 21, in terms of 3D phase ﬁeld contours.
For the sake of a better visualisation, a cut along the y-z plane is made in Fig. 20 while Fig. 21 shows the SCC region where φ < 0.5.
It can be observed that the pit tends to grow more along the y and z directions, relative to the x one.
This shape evolution of the pit, going from hemispherical to ellipsoidal, is driven by the inﬂuence of the mechanical problem.
Plastic straining is larger at the pit base and the regions of the pit mouth closer to the cross-section perpendicular to the applied load.
Consequently, the magnitude of km (εp, σh) is larger in these regions and the passive ﬁlm weaker, leading to an increase in the interface kinetics coeﬃcient.
This is in agreement with experimental observations of increasing pit depth and the initiation of lateral cracks (Turnbull, 2001).

Evolution of the SCC defect (φ < 0.5) after a time of: (a) t = 300 s, (b) t = 1200 s, and (c) t = 2100 s. The pit depth along the three Cartesian coordinate axes is shown in Fig. 22 as a function of time.
The results show that the pit growth along the x direction is linear, i.e. activation-controlled corrosion.
However, the results obtained along the y and z directions transition from linear to parabolic.
In other words, the mechanical enhancement of the interface kinetics coeﬃcient L has triggered a transition from activation-controlled to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion.
The role of the mechanical contribution will eventually become 49negligible as L raises above its saturation value (diﬀusion-limited corrosion) but those areas where mechanical straining is higher will continue to corrode faster until L reaches its saturation value everywhere, when uniform corrosion will be recovered.

Concluding remarks We have presented a new formulation for predicting dissolution-driven pit- ting and stress corrosion cracking.
Its main ingredients are: (i) a KKS-based 50phase ﬁeld model for both activation-controlled and diﬀusion-controlled cor- rosion, (ii) a mechanics-enhanced interface kinetics law grounded on mechanochem- ical theory, and (iii) a strain rate governed ﬁlm rupture and repassivation process according to the FRDR mechanism.
A numerical framework is also presented, with displacements, phase ﬁeld and concentration of dissolved ions as degrees of freedom.
The model is benchmarked by addressing ﬁve bound- ary value problems of particular interest.
First, we model the paradigmatic pencil electrode test to verify our numerical implementation and examine the model capabilities in predicting the transition from activation-controlled to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion.
Secondly, we reproduce C-ring experiments in a ﬁlm-free environment to benchmark our mechanics-enhanced corrosion laws against experimental data.
Thirdly, SCC from an ellipsoidal pit is predicted under diﬀerent conditions to quantify the inﬂuence of mechanical stresses and their interplay with the ﬁlm rupture and repassivation process.
Fourthly, the interaction between multiple pits is addressed, assessing the competing in- ﬂuences of the coeﬃcients characterising the mechanical, ﬁlm stability and interface kinetics contributions.
Finally, pit growth in a 3D solid is predicted to showcase the capabilities of the model in capturing large scale phenomena and impacting engineering practice.
The main ﬁndings are: • The interface kinetics coeﬃcient L governs corrosion rates.
Corro- sion kinetics rise with increasing L, going from activation-controlled to diﬀusion-controlled corrosion, until the process becomes diﬀusion- limited, when corrosion rates become insensitive to a further augment- ing L. • Mechanical stresses and strains enhance corrosion kinetics, in agree- 51ment with experiments, favouring localised damage and triggering a pit-to-crack transition.
However, if the mechanical enhancement of L is suﬃciently large, the diﬀusion-controlled limit is reached and the inﬂuence of the mechanical contribution reaches a saturation stage.
Thus, the inﬂuence of mechanical ﬁelds is most notable for activation- controlled corrosion.
• The presence of a passive ﬁlm exacerbates localisation and the role of mechanics.
The eﬀect is more pronounced if the ﬁlm stability coeﬃ- cient is large as ﬁlm rupture will only occur in regions where mechan- ical straining is high.
Also, cracks are more likely to nucleate under activation-controlled corrosion conditions.
Future developments could involve the extension of the model to consider other cracking mechanisms, including those driven by cathodic reactions.
Also, material microstructure and microchemistry can play an important role and should be taken into consideration in many material systems for an accurate prediction of the initial development stages.
