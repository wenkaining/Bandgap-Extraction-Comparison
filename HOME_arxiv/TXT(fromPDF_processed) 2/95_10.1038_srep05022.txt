Subtractive 3D Printing of Optically Active Diamond Structures  Aiden A. Martin, Milos Toth *, and Igor Aharonovich ยง  School of Physics and Advanced Materials, University of Technology,  Sydney, P.O. Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia     Abstract  Diamond has recently attracted considerable attention as a promising platform for quantum  technologies, photonics and high resolution sensing applications.
Here we demonstrate a  chemical approach that enables the fabrication of functional diamond structures using gas- mediated electron induced etching.
The method achieves chemical etching at room  temperature through the dissociation of surface-adsorbed H2O molecules by electron  irradiation in a water vapor environment.
High throughput, parallel processing is possible by  electron flood exposure and the use of an etch mask, while single step, mask-free three  dimensional fabrication and iterative editing are achieved using a variable pressure scanning  electron microscope.
The electron induced chemical etching paves the way to a  transformative technology for nanofabrication of diamond and other wide band-gap  semiconductors.
Diamond, long considered unconquerable due to its extraordinary strength and  chemical resistance, has found applications across numerous areas of science due to its  unique combination of optical, electronic, chemical and thermal properties1.
Most notably,  the nitrogen vacancy luminescence center (NV) has been employed as a spin qubit, enabling  the use of diamond as a platform for next generation sensing, nanopthotonic and quantum  devices2-8.
These tantalizing applications are, however, overshadowed by challenges in  fabrication arising from its extraordinary hardness and chemical resistance.
At present, diamond fabrication requires cumbersome masking techniques, and ion  bombardment or high power laser ablation which often causes damage and material  redeposition artifacts9-13.
Fabrication and editing of optoelectronic grade nanostructures is  therefore extremely limited relative to conventional semiconductors such as silicon and  gallium arsenide.
Furthermore, there is no robust technique for direct-write, deterministic  patterning of diamond that does not produce severe surface damage caused by ion  implantation and redeposition of non-volatile, sputtered or ablated material.
Here we demonstrate a chemical approach that enables the fabrication of functional diamond  structures using gas-mediated electron induced etching (Figure 1a).
The method achieves  chemical etching at room temperature through the dissociation of surface-adsorbed water  molecules by electron irradiation in a water vapor environment.
The process utilizes low  energy electrons which do not cause damage through knock-on displacement of carbon,  sputtering, and staining characteristic of reactive ion etching and focused ion beam  sputtering techniques.
High throughput, parallel processing is possible by electron flood  exposure and the use of an etch mask, while single step, mask-free three dimensional  fabrication and iterative editing are achieved using a variable pressure scanning electron  microscope.
The mask-free, electron beam induced etching (EBIE)14, 15 is used to realize  direct-write subtractive 3D printing of diamond nanostructures on inclined planes.
This  variant enables iterative editing and imaging of individual nanostructures.
The processes aredemonstrated using a standard variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM)  making diamond nanofabrication accessible to every nanotechnology laboratory in the  world.
Figure 1b-c shows the steps used to direct-write etch diamond.
The process involves  exposure of diamond to water vapor and concurrent irradiation with an electron beam,  giving rise to volatilization of carbon.16-18      Figure 1.

b-c Volatilization of diamond by electron exposure in  a gaseous H2O environment.
To demonstrate the applicability of EBIE to device fabrication, we start by fabricating a  pillar from a single crystal diamond using an etch mask.
Pillars are used as antennas that  enhance light extraction from the embedded emitters, particularly of high refractive index  semiconductors.
The EBIE process is shown schematically in Figure 2a-c.
The mask must  either absorb the incident electrons or prevent H2O from adsorbing to the diamond  substrate.
Here we use a silica mask to prevent low-energy (2 keV) electrons from  penetrating into underlying regions of diamond.
The resulting pillars (Figure 2d) have high  aspect ratios and straight side-walls, making them ideal for photonic applications.
The  minimum pillar diameter is ultimately limited by the diameter of the interaction volume of a  delta function electron beam, which scales super-linearly19  with electron energy.
In  diamond, it is equal to ~ 19 nm at 2 keV, and ~ 9 nm at 1 keV, as shown in Figure 2e.20  Nanostructures can therefore be fabricated with high resolution using the correct  combination of mask diameter and electron energy.
On the other hand, micron sized depths  can be achieved, enabling high aspect ratio geometries. Figure 2.

The silica bead acts as an etch mask that prevents the electrons from  reaching the diamond surface.

The values were calculated using a Monte Carlo model of  electron-solid interactions.
Optical properties of the pillars are shown by the fluorescence and Raman scattering data in  Figure 3.
PL spectra were recorded using a confocal microscope with a 532 nm excitation  laser.
The PL intensity of the pillar (Figure 3a) shows a two fold increase over the  neighboring, at, unprocessed region of diamond (under identical PL collection conditions).
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 3b) shows no evidence of graphitic inclusions in the irradiated  area with the first-order diamond peak positioned at 1332 cm-1 and FWHM of ~ 3.6 cm-1,  consistent with the Raman signature of pristine, single crystal diamond21, 22.Figure 3.

Next, we demonstrate the unparalleled capability of EBIE for mask-free editing of inclined  diamond surfaces.
Editing of multiple inclined facets is nearly impossible by mask-based  processing techniques, including electron- and photo-lithography.
To demonstrate the three  dimensional capability of writing on inclined surfaces, we patterned the letters `UTS' and  `NANO' into individual microparticles (Figure 4) simply by tracing out the letters using an  electron beam as shown schematically in Figure 1d.
Etching was carried out using a 20 keV  electron beam, while charging was stabilized using a low vacuum (13 Pa) environment of  H2O.
The letters are clearly visible in SEM images (Figure 4a), while atomic force  microscope (AFM) maps of the `UTS' logo show line widths and depths of ~ 100 nm  (Figure 4b).
The letters `NANO' were written intentionally across three diamond (111)  facets, showing the ability of EBIE to edit three dimensional, inclined nanostructures.
Figure  4c shows an individual diamond microparticle with visible (111) facets and Figure 4e shows  the word `NANO' imprinted in the crystal, with the letters `NA', `N' and `O', occupying all  three (111) planes, respectively.
PL measurements recorded from the diamond  microparticles exhibit strong fluorescence, confirming that the etch process does not destroy  optical properties and material functionality.
The mask-less patterning approach is  particularly attractive for generation of high resolution microfluidic channels in  microdiamond crystals, in a close proximity to optical emitters.23, 24Figure 4.  Beam-directed editing of Si-doped diamond micro-particles.

The potential of EBIE exceeds that of traditional etching techniques for wide bandgap  semiconductors.
For instance, a combination of EBIE with cathodoluminescence analysis  techniques may enable probing of the spectroscopic properties of nanostructures while the  etch parameters are modified during fabrication.
Alternatively, substrate tilting can enable  fabrication of undercut structures that are currently not available in diamond.
Finally, the  EBIE method will be pivotal for realizing hybrid devices when direct sculpting of a  nanostructure is required to achieve close proximity with an external cavity or metallic  nanostructure25.
We have demonstrated a novel, promising approach to pattern and sculpt optically active  diamond structures using two variants of H2O-mediated electron induced chemical etching:  a scalable, mask-based lithographic approach, and an extremely versatile, direct- write  editing process.
For the first time, direct 3D writing is realized on various facets of a single  microparticle.
PL and Raman analysis were used to show that the unique optical properties  of diamond are maintained and no graphitization occurs.
By leveraging the advanced  functionalities provided by a conventional SEM in conjunction with EBIE a modification to  existing devices and direct nanofabrication for rapid prototyping is enabled.
The realized  electron induced chemical etching paves the way to a transformative technology for  nanofabrication of diamond structures and other wide band-gap semiconductors.
It is thefirst step towards rendering 3D single crystal diamond geometries for high performance  photonic, sensing and quantum devices.
