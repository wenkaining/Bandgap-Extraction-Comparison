The possibility to tailor the latter  by controlling the former is guaranteed to have a great impact on applied and fundamental  research.
As shown here, proton irradiation deeply affects the surface morphology of bulk  TMD crystals.
Protons penetrate the top layer, resulting in the TMD-catalyzed production  and progressive accumulation of molecular hydrogen in the first interlayer region.
This  leads to the blistering of one-monolayer thick domes, which stud the crystal surface and2    locally turn the dark bulk material into an efficient light emitter.
The domes are stable (>2- year lifetime) and robust, and host strong, complex strain fields.
Lithographic techniques  allow to engineer the formation process so that the domes can be produced with well- ordered positions and sizes tunable from the nanometer to the micrometer scale, with  important prospects for so far unattainable applications. 1.
Introduction  The notable transformation of the electronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides  (TMDs) when reduced to a single X-M-X plane (X: chalcogen; M: metal)1 makes them suitable  for flexible, innovative optoelectronic devices2,3,4 and transistors5.
Like graphene, few-layer  TMDs can also withstand surprisingly large mechanical deformations6,7,8,9, which, coupled to the  material’s electronic structure, would enable the observation of non-dissipative topological  transport, provided a periodic modulation of strain is attained10,11,12,13.
Finally, TMD monolayers  (MLs) and nanostructures are also important for their catalytic role in the cost-effective  production of hydrogen14,15,16.
These examples share the need to achieve spatial control of the  material’s properties, over sample regions with size ranging from the nano14,16 to the  micrometer16 scale lengths.
In this study, we present a route toward the patterning of TMDs based on the effects of low- energy proton irradiation17 on the structural and electronic properties of bulk WS2, WSe2, WTe2,  MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2.
Suitable irradiation conditions trigger the production and  accumulation of H2 just beneath the first X-M-X basal plane, leading to the localized exfoliation  of the topmost monolayer and to the formation of spherically shaped domes.
Structural and3    optical characterizations confirm that these domes are typically one ML-thick and contain H2 at  pressures in the 10-100 atm range, depending on their size.
Such high pressures induce strong  and complex strain fields acting on the curved X-M-X planes, which are evaluated by means of a  mechanical model.
The domes’ morphological characteristics can be tuned by lithographically  controlling the area of the sample basal plane participating in the hydrogen production process.
This results in the unprecedented fabrication of robust domes with controlled position/density  and sizes tunable from the nanometer to the micrometer scale, that, by virtue of their inherently  strained nature and geometry, might prompt a variety of applications. 2.
Creation of light-emitting micro-/nano-domes  2.1 Proton-irradiation of bulk TMDs  The samples, consisting of thick (tens to hundreds of MLs) TMD flakes, were obtained by  mechanical exfoliation, deposited on Si substrates, and afterwards proton-irradiated using a  Kaufman source (see Methods).
The top-right inset of Fig. 1a displays the optical microscope  image of a large bulk WS2 sample after irradiation with an impinging dose dH=8×1016  protons/cm2.
Unexpectedly for indirect-gap bulk WS2, the sample exhibits strong  photoluminescence (PL, see Methods) in the red wavelength region (~690 nm), as displayed in  the main part of Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1.
The bottom-left inset shows that the  luminescence originates from circular spots with diameters varying between less than one (which  is an upper limit due to the finite resolution of our optical setup; see Methods) to few m.
As  evidenced by the atomic force microscopy (AFM, see Methods) image in Fig. 1b, these spots  signal the presence of dome-shaped features, protruding from the irradiated crystal surface, with4    virtually perfect spherical shape.
The average footprint radius of the features displayed in Fig. 1b  is R=(71560) nm—with maximal height hm=(23020) nm—but the dome size can be controlled  by the irradiated proton dose: with dH=1.0×1016 protons/cm2 we obtained nanometer-sized  structures, with average R=(8220) nm and hm=(25.65.6) nm (Fig. 1c).
Fig. 1d shows an AFM  image encompassing three domes formed on a WS2 sample analogous to that shown in panel c.
The corresponding room temperature micro-PL (-PL, see Methods) intensity map, detected at  det=689 nm and displayed in panel e, demonstrates the perfect match between the domes and the  light-emitting spots.
The µ-PL spectrum of one dome (singled out from the ensemble of panel a)  is provided in Fig. 1f.
The luminescence of an untreated WS2 ML measured under the same  excitation/collection conditions is shown for comparison.
The PL intensity of the domes is  typically larger than that of the exfoliated WS2 MLs, indeed suggesting a one-ML thickness for  the domes.
This hypothesis is confirmed by measuring the -PL spectrum and the thickness of  the outer layer of exploded domes, which are both fully consistent with that of the monolayer (as  exampled for a MoSe2 dome in Fig. S2).
This is further supported by the strong circular  dichroism measured for the PL emission of the domes (in a WS2 dome the degree of circular  polarization is >50% at 130 K, see Fig. S3A), which is a property stemming directly from the  hexagonal symmetry of the first Brillouin zone of monolayered TMDs (see Fig. S3B)18 and by  second harmonic generation measurements, as discussed in the following.
Based on the  percentage of visible domes that double as strong light emitters (see Fig. S1), at least 85-90% of  the domes can be estimated to be one-ML thick.
The energy of the PL peak (corresponding to the free-exciton recombination) of a typical (single- layer) WS2 dome is 200 meV lower than that of the ML (see Fig. 1f), mainly because of the  strain exerting on the dome’s surface7,8.5      Figure 1.

The base- 10 logarithm of the µ-PL intensity is shown as a false color scale (see color bar).
f, -PL  spectrum of a dome (red line) singled out from the ensemble displayed in (a); the blue line is the  µ-PL spectrum of a WS2 monolayer, whereas the green dashed line is the macro-PL spectrum of  an ensemble formed by ~2500 domes.
The spectra are peak-normalized for ease of comparison.
Notably, no significant linewidth broadening is observed when many such domes are measured  all together, as demonstrated by the PL spectrum of a dome ensemble, displayed in Fig. 1f as a  dashed line.6    The spectral homogeneity of the light emitted by the domes suggests that the same average strain  is present in each dome’s “peel”, irrespective of the dome size.
The evidence shown in Fig. 1  demonstrates that indirect-gap bulk WS2 can be turned into an efficient light emitter with no size  restrictions, like those typically affecting exfoliated flakes or samples grown by chemical vapor  deposition.
We point out that the reported phenomenon is substantially independent of the  specific MX2 composition (see measurements on H+-treated MoSe2, MoS2, MoTe2, WSe2 and  WTe2 in Figs. S4-S5) and is exclusively induced by the interaction of the material with protons.
No effect was found in samples exposed to molecular hydrogen or ionized helium atoms under  the same temperature and gas flow conditions.
2.2 Dome formation mechanism as a catalysis-driven process  Clues on the internal make-up of the domes can be derived by following their low-temperature  evolution.
Figs. 2a and 2b show, respectively, the 300 K and 4 K optical microscope images of a  bulk WS2 sample irradiated with dH=8×1016 protons/cm2.
At 300 K, many domes—featuring  iridescence, as accounted for below—are visible.
For T ≲30 K the domes disappear, and the  sample surface looks conspicuously flat.
As T is increased, at ~30 K, the domes bulge suddenly  in ~10 mK (see insets of Fig. 2c and Movie 1).
As illustrated in Fig. 2c, the transition  temperature distribution was sampled over more than 500 domes obtained on several proton- irradiated flakes deposited on different substrates (see Methods).
The resulting average transition  temperature is (32.22.4) K, a number close to the critical temperature of H2 (33.18 K) and thus  compatible exclusively with the presence of molecular hydrogen inside the domes (see  Supplementary Note SN1): when T is sufficiently low/high, H2 liquefies/boils, and the domes  deflate/inflate always in the same position.7      Figure 2.
Dome inflating/deflating process.

The orange line is a Gaussian fit to the  data.
The red point-line is the cumulative function of the histogram (right axis).
The solid wine  curve superimposed is a fit to the cumulative function providing the average transition  temperature T HLV of proton-irradiated flakes.
The blue point-line is the cumulative function of  the histogram derived from deuteron-irradiated WS2 flakes (see Supplementary Note SN1).
The  corresponding fit providing T DLV is performed only on the part of the cumulative function in  which H effects are negligible (see SN1).
The insets are two optical microscope pictures of the  same dome, recorded immediately before (top) and after (bottom) the transition temperature.
d,  Sketch of the process leading to the formation of domes caused by the local blistering of  atomically thin material membranes.
The fluctuations observed in the liquid-vapor transition temperature (T HLV) are chiefly due to the  spread in the size (and hence in the internal pressure) of the domes.
To reinforce our hypothesis,  we considered the study of isotopic effects in our system and we repeated our analysis on 500  more WS2 domes, obtained by deuteron irradiation.
The (p-T) phase diagrams of hydrogen and  deuterium19 show an isotopic shift in the temperature at which the liquid-vapor phase transition  occurs of about 2.9 K (the exact value depending on the pressure of the gas).
The details of our  measurements are discussed in Supplementary Note SN1.
The cumulative function of deuteron- irradiated samples id displayed in Fig. 2b (see Fig. SN1A for the histogram): differently from8    proton-irradiated samples, the behavior is in this case characterized by a composite shape,  corresponding to the three different steps that are apparent in the cumulative function.
We  ascribe empirically these three steps to the presence of H2, HD and D2 molecules20 within the  domes.
There are several possible explanations why H may be present also in deuterium-treated  samples: 1) even the highest purity deuterium bottles contain a 0.25% of H2 and HD molecules;  2) it has been reported that deuterons permeate through graphene and BN monolayers much  slower than protons.
At room temperature the areal conductivity of deuterons results to be 1/10  of that of protons21.
This effect could be even much stronger in the case of TMDs, whose single  layer is constituted by three atomic planes; 3) the hydrogen evolution reaction could be  remarkably faster with respect to the deuterium evolution reaction because of the high mass  difference between the two isotopes22,23.
For deuteron-irradiated samples, a sigmoidal fit was  thus performed only to the high-temperature data of the cumulative function shown, where no  effect from hydrogen is expected.
The fit estimates a transition temperature of T DLV = (35.7±4.3)  K, resulting in a difference between the centers of the distributions equal to (3.5±0.7) K,  consistent with the (p-T) diagram of the two isotopes.
Indeed, the measured transition  temperatures are consistent only with the presence of H2 (or its isotopes) within the domes (see  Fig. SN1B).
We can therefore hypothesize that, during irradiation, accelerated protons penetrate  through the top MX2 basal plane (Fig. 2d top), becoming confined in between two X-M-X layers.
Therein, triggered by the catalytic activity of TMDs14,15,16, the following reaction takes place:  2H+ + 2𝑒−→H2,                                                            (1)  with electrons e- being supplied from the ground contact (Fig. 2d middle).
The subsequent build- up of H2 molecules, stored just beneath the top surface, leads to the local blistering of one X-M- X plane, and eventually to the formation of the domes (Fig. 2d bottom).
The above scenario is9    supported by theoretical studies, which showed that thermal protons remain trapped in the metal  plane of X-M-X layers and do not diffuse, thus favoring the accumulation of H2 molecules in the  interlayer regions24.
The formation of localized nucleation sites (i.e., the domes), rather than the  establishment of a uniform H2 distribution underneath the top layer, is due to the van der Waals  (vdW) forces existing between adjacent planes, which prevent H2 molecules from moving freely.
The shape of the domes itself—i.e., their height-to-radius ratio—results from the interplay  between: (i) the vdW forces that tend to keep the TMD layers together, thus minimizing the  dome radius; (ii) the stiffness of the top TMD layer, which limits the dome height; and (iii) the  tendency to expand of the trapped gas, which results in the application of a constant pressure on  the dome’s walls6.
We estimate such pressure to be about 10 atm for R≳500 nm, given the  average T HLV=32.2 K and the H2 phase diagram (see SN1 and Ref. 25).
Therefore, the multi- colored look sported by the large domes in Fig. 2a can be ascribed to Newton’s rings caused by  the interference of the light reflected inside the H2-filled spherical volume26. 3.
Domes’ strain fields  3.1 Domes’ profile and strain tensor modeling As noted earlier and shown in Fig. 1f, the average PL peak energy of the domes is about 200  meV lower than that of the corresponding material in the ML form (see also Fig. S5).
This is  ascribable to the presence of tensile strain,  , which reaches its maximum 𝜀m at the domes’  summit.
As predicted by Hencky’s model7,27,28,  𝜀m = 𝑓(𝜐) ∙(ℎm 𝑅 ⁄ )2,                                                        (2)10    where f only depends on the material’s Poisson ratio, v, while R and hm are the dome footprint  radius and maximum height, respectively; see Supplementary Note SN2.
As reported in Ref. 6,  the dome’s height-to-radius ratio is largely independent of the dome’s dimensions: hm scales  linearly with R, and the value of m in a given material can be estimated by Eq. (2).
As shown in  Fig. 3a, wherein the experimental (i.e, obtained by AFM) values of ℎm are plotted as a function  of R for six different chemical compositions, the expected linear dependence is verified over a  wide span of dome sizes (R between 100 nm and ~3 µm).
The average values of hm/R estimated  for each of the investigated materials are: 0.160.02 (MoS2), 0.180.02 (MoSe2), 0.170.02  (MoTe2), 0.160.02 (WS2), 0.150.01 (WSe2) and 0.130.02 (WTe2) yielding the values of m  shown in Fig. 3a and in SN2.
The height profile of the dome and the evolution of the strain tensor across the dome’s surface  can both be computed via Finite-Element Method (FEM) calculations, performed within the  framework of nonlinear membrane theory (see Supplementary Note 3)27.
As an illustrative case,  Fig. 3b (left) shows the comparison between these calculations and the AFM profile of a MoS2  dome with R=(3.760.12) m and hm=(61815) nm, formed after irradiation of a flake with  8×1016 protons/cm2.11    Figure 3.
Dome’s shape, strain, and size distribution.

The average hm/R provides the average dome biaxial tensile strain at the  dome apex m, according to the equation reported in the figure.
b, Left side: Comparison  between the height profile of a MoS2 dome measured by AFM (black dots), and the profile  obtained by Finite Elements calculations (solid orange line; see Methods).
The dome footprint  radius and height, as estimated by AFM measurements, are 3.76 µm and 618 nm, respectively.
Right side: Components of the strain tensor along the three principal axes of the dome, i.e., in the  radial (𝜀r, solid olive line), circumferential (𝜀t, solid red line), and perpendicular (𝜀z, solid blue  line) directions.
These components are represented as color-coded arrows in the inset, showing a  three-dimensional AFM image of the dome.
As summarized in Supplementary Fig. SN3A, FEM simulations correctly reproduce the  experimental profile for all the investigated materials.
The calculated spatial dependences  (0rR) of the principal components of the strain tensor —namely, along the circumferential (𝜀t)  and radial (𝜀r) in-plane directions27 and along the perpendicular (𝜀z) out-of-plane direction —are  also displayed in Fig. SN3A and 3b (right): interestingly, strain is isotropic biaxial (𝜀t = 𝜀r =  1.97% for the dome in Fig. 3b) only at the very top of the dome, gradually becoming uniaxial as  the circumferential component goes to zero near the dome’s edge.
In between these two limits,  strain is anisotropic (𝜀t  ≠ 𝜀r), with a negative perpendicular component accounting for a  compression in out-of-plane direction (as detailed in Supplementary Note 3).
The complex  spatial dependence of the strain tensor across the domes is reflected by the spatial evolution of - Raman measurements where, as a general feature, a progressive softening of the in-plane and  out-of-plane vibrational modes is observed with increasing strain over the dome.
Due to the  diffraction-limited size of our laser spot (directly measured and modelled by a Gaussian with  standard deviation  =0.230.01 m, see Methods), the finer details of this evolution can only be  appreciated on large (R>2 m) domes: -Raman measurements were therefore performed on  WS2, MoS2 and WSe2, where large domes were fabricated, giving results in good agreement with  the literature7 discussed in Supplementary Figs. S6-S8.
Our results agree well also with12    Hencky’s model7,27, yielding 𝜀m = 𝜀t = 𝜀r =1.95% for the MoS2 dome shown in Fig. 3b (the  same applies to the other MX2 compounds investigated; see SN3).
Moreover, the pressure values  used in the calculations match rather well, for µm-sized domes, with the ~10 atm estimated from  the average T HLV obtained in the previous section (see Fig. 2c).
For smaller (R<<1 µm) domes,  the model results in internal pressures in excess of 100 atm—as shown in Figure SN3B and  reported in Ref.
6—for which H2 should enter a supercritical fluid phase29.
4. Engineered creation of TMD domes  The detailed knowledge of the evolution of the strain tensor across the domes’ surface is  particularly relevant since strain is known to alter profoundly the electronic properties -and  hence the optical and transport properties- of TMDs, which can lead to, e.g., the emergence of  giant pseudo-magnetic fields and to the generation of persistent currents10,11,12,13.
For this to  happen, specific and stable configurations of the strain field need be achieved, and spatial control  and durability are therefore necessary.
In fact, other methods for the creation of strained TMD  bubbles either allow size/position controllability but lack durability (as in Refs.
7, 9) or permit to  create durable structures but which lack any spatial ordering (as in Ref. 6), in both cases  considerably limiting their potentiality for applications.
As shown in Fig. S9A, indeed, the domes created via proton-irradiation remain intact—and keep  exhibiting strong light emission—for temperatures up to 510 K. In addition, the shape and size of  these nano/micro-structures remain unchanged with time—in the best cases over more than two  years—as illustrated by Figs. S9B-F. This confirms the notable absence of gas-permeable, nm- scale pores in TMD materials, as already reported in the literature7; moreover, the exceptional13    durability of our domes is likely also aided by the strong adhesion forces existing between the  ML forming the dome and its parent substrate, as well as by the low permeability to H2 of the  latter.
In the bulging devices commonly employed to induce strain in TMD membranes7,8,9 the  ML is usually laying directly on a SiO2 substrate.
As a result, the devices typically deflate within  weeks, mostly due to leaks through the substrate and the TMD/SiO2 interface7.
Besides  durability, the applicative prospects of our MX2 domes are greatly enhanced by the possibility to  precisely control their size and position.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, indeed, we can engineer the  dome formation process, which can be achieved depositing an H-opaque masking layer prior to  proton irradiation.
The sample displayed in Fig. 4, for example, was patterned by electron-beam  lithography with arrays of circular openings with diameter S=1, 3, and 5 m (see Figure S10 and  Ref. 30), followed by proton irradiation (dH=41016 protons/cm2) and by the removal of the H- opaque mask (see Methods).
Fig. 4a displays the AFM image of a WS2 array of neatly arranged  single domes with average R=(0.930.07) m and hm=(0.130.02) m, obtained for S=3 m.
The µ-PL signal emitted by the same array is imaged in Fig. 4b (see also the µ-PL map in the  inset).
The ability to fabricate ordered arrays of light-emitting domes is an inherent advantage of  our system with respect to, e.g., the bubbles forming because of the accidental incorporation of  contaminant gases between monolayers and their supporting substrates6,31, which have been  shown to be durable32 but lack any spatial ordering.
The dome dimensions can also be  engineered by varying the opening size.14      Figure 4.
Controlling the dome size and position.

c, Distribution of the footprint radius of domes  formed in opening arrays with diameter S=1 (green), 3 (blue), and 5 (red) m.
The distribution of  randomly formed domes during the same process is given by gray bars.
The distribution width is  illustrated on top of the figure by horizontal bars.
The inset is an optical microscope image  comparing random vs ordered (S=3 µm) domes.
The much narrower distribution of the ordered  domes with respect to the random ones can be appreciated.
d, Second harmonic generation  (SHG) map collected on an array of ordered WS2 domes obtained after proton irradiation (dose  dH=1.51017 protons/cm2) of a flake patterned with an H-opaque mask.
The mask had elliptical  openings with 2- and 1-µm semi axes and 4-µm center-to-center distance.15 In fact, Fig. 4c shows the distributions of the dome footprint radii grouped into randomly formed  and ordered dome subsets obtained during the same proton irradiation process.
It is worth noting  that the domes formed using the lithographic approach sport a remarkably narrower size  distribution, where the size is clearly determined by the diameter of the aperture.
Such  distribution gets even narrower with decreasing the dome size.
Finally, in the ordered arrays, the  average dome volume scales with the surface area (0.25S2) available to the reaction (1) (see  Fig. S11), thus supporting the hypothesis of the dome formation as a catalysis-driven process.
We point out that controlling the dome position and size over large areas is valuable for the  creation of efficient site-controlled photon emitters, as well as in many other situations.
For  example, TMD MLs have been shown to give rise to efficient second-harmonic generation  (SHG), due to their broken inversion symmetry33,34.
This property is retained by our domes -as  demonstrated in Fig. 4d for an ordered array of WS2 domes excited at 900 nm (see Methods)-  which could thus conceivably act as site-controlled SHG “hot spots”, ideal for the integration  with specifically designed photonic crystal cavities35,36.
One should also notice that the intense  second harmonic signal featured by the domes in panel d indicates a > 96% formation yield of  one-ML-thick domes.
5. Conclusions and perspectives  ML TMDs have been demonstrated to possess intriguing optoelectronic and mechanical  properties, which renders them suitable for flexible and innovative optoelectronic devices.16 Furthermore, they have emerged as a fascinating class of materials for catalysis15.
Here, we  demonstrated that the catalytic properties of TMDs can be activated by simply irradiating bulk  flakes with a low energy proton flux, which leads to the formation and accumulation of hydrogen  and allows to control the electronic properties of ML TMDs at the nano- and micro- scale  through the creation of highly strained domes.
These structures can be formed at the desired  location and with controllable size on six different compounds.
Since we can precisely control  the amount of H2 in single domes, they can act as microscopic calibration gauges for H2 sensors  or for controlled reactive gas delivery (see Fig. S12) in nano-reactors37 with unprecedented  accuracies.
The engineered formation of domes also allows the creation of arrays of linear and  non-linear light emitters and of periodic strain-fields, as here demonstrated.
Finally, it should be  noted that several other 2D crystals—such as graphene, h-BN, and phosphorene—have been  found to be virtually transparent to protons, according to both experiments38 and theoretical  calculations24.
Therefore, their deposition on top of bulk TMD samples before proton irradiation  should not hinder the dome formation process, and the controlled formation of (ordered) TMD  domes can thus be exploited to define a template for modulating strain in a much wider range of  two-dimensional materials, leading, e.g., to the emergence of giant pseudo-magnetic fields in  graphene, and creating the conditions for the generation of dissipation-less electrical  currents10,11,12,13.
Movie 1  Optical microscope movie of a WS2 sample irradiated with an H+ dose dH = 8×1016 protons/cm2.
The movie (acquired by employing a 50 objective with NA=0.5) was taken as the temperature17    was raised from T = 19.75 K to T = 45.05 K. The temperature frame step is 10 mK. The counter  visible on the top-right corner of the movie displays the sample temperature.
At T28 K the domes  start inflating due to the liquid-vapor transition of H2.
Methods     1 Sample preparation and proton irradiation procedure  MX2 (M=W, Mo; X=S, Se, Te) bulk flakes are mechanically exfoliated by the scotch tape method  on various Si substrates: bare, SiO2- and Au-covered.
The samples are then mounted in a vacuum  chamber secured on a holder in such a way to guarantee the thermal and electrical (ground) contact  between the holder and the sample.
The chamber is evacuated at p = 1.010-6 mbar and the  temperature of the sample holder is set at 150° C.
Meanwhile, protons are produced in an ionization  chamber and accelerated by a system of grids that generates an H+ beam steered onto the sample  surface with energies between about 5 and 500 eV (in the present study an energy < 100 eV was  employed).
The total impinging H+ dose is determined by setting the exposure time once the proton  flux is fixed.
Once the target dose is obtained, the sample holder is slowly cooled down to room  temperature and the chamber is brought to atmospheric pressure.
The duration of the whole process  is of the order of few hours.
A sketch of the hydrogenation setup is shown in Fig. S13A.      2 Liquid-to-vapor phase transition measurements The measurements were performed by mounting the sample in a closed-cycle cryostat by  Montana Instruments allowing the use of a 50 objective with NA=0.5 mounted externally to the  cryostat optical window.
The image of the sample was monitored on a CCD camera to record in18    real time the sample image with a rate of 10 frames per second.
The sample was mounted on a  special copper holder featuring a thermal link to the cryostat platform (the coldest point of the  system) thus ensuring optimal and fast heat exchange with the sample.
The temperature was  varied from 5 K to more than 50 K using a calibrated heater.
The sample temperature T was  measured by a calibrated 4-point thermometer mounted as close as possible to the samples and T  was increased at a low rate equal to ~40 mK/s. The liquid-vapor phase transition temperature  was established by subsequent careful visual inspection of the videos acquired during the T  sweep.
More details on the isotopic shift measurements are given in SN1.
3 Optical measurements  Photoluminescence (PL) and Raman experiments were performed using the following equipment.
The excitation laser was provided by two different single-frequency Nd:YVO4 lasers (V8 Verdi  by Coherent Inc. and DPSS series by Lasos) with emission wavelength equal to 532.2 nm.
The PL  emission was spectrally analyzed by means of a 750-mm focal length monochromator ACTON  SP750i equipped with 3 gratings (300, 600, and 1200 groove/mm) and detected by a back- illuminated Si CCD Camera (model 100BRX) by Princeton Instruments.
The -Raman spectral  resolution was 0.7 cm-1 and the -PL spectral resolution was 0.2 meV.
The laser light was filtered  out by a very sharp high-pass Razor edge filter at 535 nm (Semrock).
For micro(μ)-PL/Raman on single domes or ML, a confocal microscope was used to excite and  collect the light.
Several microscope objectives (100 NA=0.9, 50 NA=0.5, 20 NA=0.4) were  employed depending on the specific experiment.
For -Raman mapping (Figs. S6-S8), we used an Olympus 100 objective with NA=0.9.
The  minimum scanning step was 80 nm using a compact open loop piezoelectric xy-scanner19    (Attocube).
The mapping was performed along a dome diameter to reduce the data acquisition  time and thus increase the accuracy of the measurements.
We checked that similar results were  obtained also along different diameters of the domes.
The laser spot size resulting from the NA=0.9 objective employed for -Raman mapping was  experimentally determined as follows: the laser was scanned across a reference sample,  lithographically patterned with features of known width (1 µm).
The intensity of the reflected light  was fitted with the ideal reflectance profile, convolved with a Gaussian peak.
The standard  deviation of this peak, obtained as a fitting parameter, provides our estimate of  =0.230.01 µm.
For PL measurements on dome ensembles, the excitation laser was focalized by a lens of 20 cm  focal length positioned laterally with respect to the luminescence-collecting objective.
In this  manner, the samples were excited over an area in excess of 100100 μm2.
The PL emission was  collected by a 10× Leitz objective with NA=0.2, yielding a PL signal averaged over a large part of  the sample under study and allowing us to get statistically reliable.
This applies to Fig. 1f (dashed  line) and Fig. S9A.
The same set-up was used for -PL imaging (Fig. 1a and 4b) by collecting the  luminescence through a low-aperture microscope objective and monitoring the pan-chromatic PL  intensity with a CCD.
Low-temperature -PL mapping and imaging experiments were performed using a Montana cooler  cryostation able to reach the lowest temperature of 4 K.   The circular polarization-resolved μ-PL experiments (Fig. S3) were performed by using a He-Ne  laser by UniPhase as excitation source (exc=632.8 nm) using the setup and procedure described  in Fig. S13B.  All optical measurements were intensity-normalized by the set-up spectral response by using a  calibrated black-body source at 3050 K.20    The second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements (Fig. 4d) were conducted with a confocal  optical microscope (Carl-Zeiss LSM 780) equipped with a 50 optical object (Epiplan-Neofluar  0.85, DIC).
A Ti:Sa laser from Spectra-Physics (100 fs, 80 MHz, wavelength tuneable between  690 and 1040 nm) was used to pump the sample.
The laser wavelength was set at 900 nm.
4 Atomic force microscope measurements  AFM measurements were performed in tapping mode, by using two different AFM instruments  that provided the same results within the experimental uncertainty.
In one case, we used a  Dimension Icon microscope with a Nanoscope V controller (Bruker), equipped with R-Tespa tips.
In another case, we used a Veeco Digital Instruments Dimension D3100 microscope equipped with  a Nanoscope IIIa controller, employing Tapping Mode monolithic silicon probes with a nominal  tip curvature radius of 5-10 nm and a force constant of 40 N/m.
All the data were analyzed with the Gwyddion software and the convolution of the tip used was  duly taken into account.
All the data were taken at room temperature and under the same ambient  conditions (atmospheric pressure).
5 Electron-beam lithography patterning  The fabrication of H-opaque masks was performed by means of electron-beam lithography  employing a Vistec EPBG 5HR system working at 100 kV. A hydrogen silesquioxane (HSQ)  negative-tone e-beam resist was employed because of its property to be H-opaque under the  irradiation conditions used in this work.
Ordered arrays of octagonal openings with the desired21    diameter were patterned on an 80-nm thick HSQ masking layer deposited on top of the sample  surface.
An electron dose of 300 μC/cm2 and an aqueous development solution of tetramethyl  ammonium hydroxide at 2.4% were used for the patterning of the HSQ masks.
After the H  treatment, the HSQ masks were removed by chemical etching in an aqueous solution of potassium  borates at 5-15% and potassium hydroxide at 2%, which dissolves HSQ but does not attack the  transition metal dichalcogenide samples (see Figs. 4 and S10).
