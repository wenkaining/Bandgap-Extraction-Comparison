Louie1,2 1 Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 2 Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 3 Instituto de F´ısica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Caixa Postal 68528, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 21941-972, Brazil (Dated: November 6, 2018) The ordering of Na ions in NaxCoO2 is investigated systematically by combining detailed density functional theory (DFT) studies with model calculations.
Various ground state ordering patterns are identiﬁed, and they are in excellent agreement with avaliable experimental results.
Our results suggest that the primary driving force for the Na ordering is the screened Coulomb interaction among Na ions.
Possible eﬀects of the Na ordering on the electronic structure of the CoO2 layer are discussed.
We propose that the nonexistence of a charge ordered insulating state at x = 2/3 is due to the lack of a commensurate Na ordering pattern, whereas an extremely stable Na ordering at x = 0.5 enhances the charge ordering tendency, resulting in an insulating state as observed experimentally.
PACS numbers: 61.50.Ah,61.66.-f,61.18.-j The recently renewed research interest in NaxCoO2 since the discovery of superconductivity [1] in the hy- drated materials has revealed a range of interesting and intriguing properties of this system.
One of the most interesting discoveries is the determination of its phase diagram as the doping level x is varied [2]: Two metal- lic phases at low and high dopings are separated by an insulating state at x = 0.5.
Along with this insulating state there is strong evidence of an ordered Na layer and commensurate charge orderings in the CoO2 layer.
This raises the possibility of a subtle interplay between the Na ordering and the charge ordering in the CoO2 layer[2, 3].
At certain Na compositions, this interplay might have profound eﬀects on the electronic or magnetic properties of the CoO2 layer if a particularly stable Na ordering pat- tern exists and whether a commensurate charge ordering is allowed.
Therefore, a uniﬁed theory of the Na order- ing mechanism may be critical for a better understanding of the electronic structure in this system.
The observed Na ordering pattern [2, 4] at x = 0.5 agrees well with our theoretical prediction [5], and this motivates us to extend our investigation on Na ordering at other compositions studied by recent electron diﬀraction experiments [4].
In this paper, we identify ground state Na ordering patterns at various compositions and show that the Na ordering is primarily driven by the intra-plane screened electrostatic interactions.
The details of the electronic structure of the CoO2 plane, on the other hand, have minimal eﬀects.
The compound NaxCoO2 assumes a layered structure which consists of alternating triangular CoO2 and Na planes.
Although there have been reports [6, 7, 8, 9] of several stacking patterns, we shall restrict our discussion to the so-called γ phase, which is usually observed for low to intermediate Na compositions.
There are two dis- tinct Na sites within a given plane, denoted as Na(1) and Na(2) (Wyckoﬀindices 2b and 2d).
The Na(1) site, being directly between two Co ions, is slightly higher in energy than the Na(2) site[5].
Therefore, Na ions will normally prefer occupying the Na(2) sites.
We calculate the total energy of 82 ordered structures of NaxCoO2 using ﬁrst principles techniques.
The choice of structures for the ground state search was guided by the MAPS code [10].
Our calculations are based on density-functional theory (DFT) [11, 12] within the local density approximation (LDA) with the Ceperly- Alder exchange-correlation functional [13, 14].
Ab initio Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials [15] are used.
Calcu- lations are performed using the SIESTA code [16, 17], which expands the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions in a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).
A double-zeta plus polarization (DZP) basis is used.
The energy cutoﬀ for the charge density grid is 1000 Ry.
The irreducible Brillouin Zone is sampled using Monkhorst-Pack grids [18] with a density of k-points equivalent to 12×12×2 for a primitive unit cell.
Atomic positions are relaxed until forces are smaller than 0.005 eV/˚A.
We keep the lattice constants ﬁxed at a = 2.82˚A and c = 10.89˚A.
Although the lattice constants of NaxCoO2 will vary slightly with Na concentration, our results are not sensitive to this small variation.
The energetics of Na ordering in NaxCoO2 can be stud- ied using the well-stablished formalism for binary alloys [19].
The fundamental quantity that determines the sta- bility of a given arrangement η of Na ions and vacancies with Na composition x is the formation energy ∆Eη: ∆Eη DF T = Eη −xENaCoO2 −(1 −x)ECoO2, (1) where Eη, ENaCoO2 and ECoO2 are the total energies per site of the structure η, and of the pure compounds NaCoO2 and CoO2, respectively, calculated within DFT.
Fig. 1 shows the calculated formation energies of all 82 structures (open dots).
We highlight the ground state structures (red dots) joined together by the hull-shaped curve (red line).
Structures with formation energy above the convex hull are unstable against phase separation into the two ground states with nearby compositions.
Red ar- rows indicate the structures proposed by Zandbergen et al. [4] (at x = 0.11, x = 0.30, x = 0.33, x = 0.50,2 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 x -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 ∆E η DFT (eV) FIG.

x = 0.71 and x = 0.75) based on electron diﬀraction experiments.
The agreement between theory and ex- periment is remarkable in that all experimentally pro- posed structures are indeed ground states within DFT.
Although the structure at x = 0.30 appears to be an ex- ception (it is not a ground state within DFT), it is too close to the convex hull to be neglected as such, given the uncertainties in the calculation.
Moreover, we ﬁnd additional ground states at x = 0.20, x = 0.25, x = 0.60, x = 0.80 and x = 0.83.
A structure at x = 0.40 is also too close to the convex hull to be ruled out.
These structures have not been observed experimentally, perhaps because samples at these particular compositions were not an- alyzed.
An ordered structure at x = 0.64 also appears experimentally [4].
According to our results, at this com- position the sample should be phase-separated between the x = 0.60 and the x = 0.71 ground states.
All ground state structures and the near ground states at x = 0.30 and x = 0.40 are depicted in Fig.2.
We also display the lowest energy structure at x = 0.67 (not a ground state), for discussion purposes.
Before discussing in detail the various ordered struc- tures, let us ﬁrst address the driving force for Na order- ing in this system.
The simplest explanation would be electrostatics since the Na atoms lose one electron each to the CoO2 network, they arrange themselves so as to minimize electrostatic energy.
We perform model calcu- lations to test this hypothesis, in which the Ewald (ionic) energies of the diﬀerent arrangements of Na+1 ions are computed.
In these calculations, we assume that the elec- tronic charge is spread over the CoO2 planes neighbor- ing the Na-vacancy layer, which is consistent with our previous calculations [5].
Also, the chemical diﬀerence between Na(1) and Na(2) sites is simulated by adding an energy ǫ1 per Na ion to the Ewald energies for a Na(1) site.
Therefore, the total energy per unit cell for this (a) x = 0 (b) x = 0.11 (c) x = 0.20 (d) x = 0.25 (e) x = 0.30 (f) x = 0.33 (g) x = 0.40 (i) x = 0.60 (j) x = 0.67 (l) x = 0.75 (m) x = 0.80 (o) x = 1 (k) x = 0.71 (n) x = 0.83 (h) x = 0.50 a1 a2 FIG.

The dashed lines represent the projected triangular lattice of Co atoms.
Large red open circles and small red dots represent projected Na positions in diﬀerent planes, at z = 0 and z = 0.5c, re- spectively.
The Na(1) sites fall on top of the triangular lattice sites and Na(2) sites fall in the center of the triangles.
Blue lines indicate the minimum unit cell in each case.
A detailed discussion of each structure is presented in the text.
electrostatic model is deﬁned as: Eη model = Eη Ewald + N η 1 ǫ1, (2) where N η 1 is the number of Na atoms in Na(1) sites for the structure η. Figure 3 shows, for each structure, ∆Eη DF T (Eq.(1)) versus the calculated formation energy using the above model (∆Eη model).
We clearly see that these two quan- tities are proportional: ∆Eη DF T = κ∆Eη model.
The best ﬁt (rms deviation of 0.016 eV) is obtained for κ = 0.514 and an on-site energy diﬀerence between Na(1) and Na(2) sites κǫ1 = 67 meV.
A value of κ smaller than 1 is ex- pected because of screening and partial ionization eﬀects, which are absent from the model calculations and natu- rally included in the DFT calculations.
Therefore, DFT formation energies can be described with good accuracy by a model of screened electrostatic interactions, show- ing unambiguously that the dominant driving force for Na ordering in NaxCoO2 is electrostatic.
We now discuss the geometries of the structures shown3 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 ∆E η model (eV) -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 ∆E η DFT (eV) FIG.

In the low concentration regime, we ﬁnd a ground state at x = 0.11 (1/9) (Fig. 2(b)), correspond- ing to an in-plane arrangement of Na “impurities” in a 3 × 3 triangular lattice.
Surprisingly, the lowest energy structure corresponds to placing both Na atoms (one in each plane) in the less favorable Na(1) sites.
This struc- ture prevails with respect to other arrangements because it minimizes the inter-plane electrostatic energy: The Na atoms can be as far as possible from each other.
Inter- estingly, this arrangement corresponds to placing each Na atom in the middle of the projections of the three Na atoms of neighboring planes, and it is consistent with the experimental observation of a √ 3× √ 3 superstructure in the diﬀraction patterns of Ref.
[4] if a random stacking of such arrangements occurs.
At x = 0.20, the ground state has a √ 7 × √ 7 super- cell, shown in Fig. 2(c), with both Na ions in Na(2) sites.
Periodic repetition of this cell leads to an arrangement of Na ions along rows perpendicular to the [110] direc- tion (the horizontal direction in Fig. 2).
The distance between Na ions in a row is √ 3a.
Such pattern of rows have been experimentally observed for diﬀerent composi- tions and have been proposed to be the guiding principle for Na ordering [4].
Indeed, we observe this pattern in all other Na compositions except x = 1/9, 1/4, and 2/3 (not a ground state).
The same pattern of rows is observed in the lowest energy structures calculated using the simple electrostatic model.
Therefore, the rows arise naturally from the minimization of electrostatic energy, combined with the constraint that only discrete lattice sites can be occupied by Na ions.
Fig. 2(d) shows the ground state for x = 0.25, a 2 × 2 triangular lattice.
In this case, both Na ions occupy the more preferable Na(2) sites.
In Fig. 2(e), the lowest en- ergy structure for x = 0.30 is shown.
It has precisely the same in-plane arrangement proposed by Zandbergen et al.[4].
Again, it corresponds to rows of Na ions per- pendicular to [110] and all ions occupy Na(2) sites.
As discussed above, it is not a ground state in our calcula- tions (by merely 1 meV/site).
At x = 0.33 (1/3), the arrangement is again a trian- gular lattice ( √ 3 × √ 3), as shown in Fig. 2(f).
This structure is exactly the same as proposed by Zandbergen et al. [4].
The x = 1/3 concentration is of particu- lar interest due to the observed superconductivity in the hydrated system at x ∼0.3.
Although the role water plays is still unknown, the screening of the Na potential by water molecules might suppress the tendency of de- veloping a commensurate charge ordering pattern in the CoO2 layer, which may then lead to a more homogeneous electronic system and favor a superconducting state over other competing phases at low temperature.
Possible charge disproportionation and gap opening at this dop- ing level in the unhydrated system has been studied pre- viously [20].
However, so far such an insulating state has not been observed.
Fig. 2(g) shows the lowest energy arrangement for x = 0.40 (not a ground state, by 0.6 meV/site).
It also follows the rows pattern, and the ratio between Na(1) and Na(2) occupancies is 1.
In Fig. 2(h), the ground state for x = 0.50 is shown, which is a √ 3 × 2 supercell.
The arrangement also fol- lows the pattern of rows and it has also been predicted theoretically [5] and observed experimentally [4].
This structure is particularly stable since all other in-plane arrangements with a similar unit cell at this composi- tion are at least 25 meV/site (or 200 meV/cell) higher in energy.
Note again that the ratio between Na(1) and Na(2) occupancies is 1.
This ratio tends to be higher for structures with intermediate composition, since the on- site chemical energy diﬀerence between Na(1) and Na(2) sites becomes less important than arranging the Na ions as far as possible to minimize electrostatic energy.
The existence of a particularly stable Na ordering pattern, to- gether with the observed insulating state at this compo- sition [2], strongly indicate an interplay between the Na ordering and the charge ordering in the CoO2 layer in this system.
Our results suggest that, if such an interplay ex- ists, it is more likely that an ordered Na potential drives the charge ordering or enhances this tendency.
Studies of charge ordering in this system with the presence of a commensurate Na ordering will be reported in a separate paper.
At x = 0.60, the ground state structure is again a √ 7 × √ 7 supercell, shown in Fig. 2(i) with a pattern of rows and a Na(1)/Na(2) occupancy ratio of 1/2.
The composition x = 0.67 (2/3), like x = 1/3, has been the subject of many discussions due to its apparent proximity to charge ordering in a triangular lattice[20, 21, 22].
The lowest energy structure corresponds to 3 × 1 supercell, shown in Fig. 2(j).
This structure is clearly lower in energy than any honeycomb arrangement of Na ions.
It is obvious that a honeycomb arrangement would be more compatible with the proposed charge ordering pattern[20, 21, 22].
Therefore, we propose that the nonexistence of a charge-ordered insulating state at this composition is due to the lack of a stable and commensurate Na ordering.
The ground state structure at x = 0.71 (5/7) is shown4 in Fig. 2(k).
It is impressive that such a complex ar- rangement with a large supercell ( √ 13 × √ 13) corre- sponds to a ground state structure, as seen experimen- tally [4].
For this structure we have a Na(1)/Na(2) oc- cupancy ratio of 2/3 and once more the rows pattern is followed.
In the high x limit, this pattern becomes sim- pler to analyze: Low energy structures are composed of rows of Na(2) ions intercalated by rows of vacancies and Na(1) ions.
For instance, for the x = 0.71 structure the repetition is 3×Na(2)-vac-2×Na(1)-vac.
For x = 0.75 we ﬁnd again the same ground state as proposed by experiments [4], a √ 3×4 supercell shown in Fig. 2(l).
In this case, the pattern of rows is 3×Na(2)- vac-3×Na(1)-vac, i.e., there are equal numbers of Na(2) and Na(1) ions.
This structure is lower in energy than that proposed by Shi et al.[23].
Measurements of local distortions of Na(2)O6 polyhedra at x = 0.75 have been recently performed by neutron diﬀraction [24].
Appar- ently, Na(2) ions move to oﬀ-center positions, resulting in two long (2.56 ˚A) and four short (2.32 ˚A) Na-O bonds.
Our calculated Na-O bond lengths for this structure are 2.57 ˚A and 2.29 ˚A, in excellent agreement with experi- ment.
At x = 0.80 and x = 0.83 (5/6) (Figs. 2 (m) and (n), respectively) we ﬁnd ground-state structures that belong to the same “family” as the x = 0.75 structure, i.e., they follow similar row patterns with n×Na(2)-vac- 3×Na(1)-vac rows in a √ 3 × (n + 5)/2 cell, with n = 3 for x = 0.75, n = 5 for x = 0.80 and n = 7 for x = 0.83.
Therefore, it is very likely that beyond x = 0.75 one can construct inﬁnitely many ground states (polytipoids) by simply intercalating odd numbers of Na(2) rows with the sequence of rows -vac-3×Na(1)-vac-.
In fact, if one takes into account entropic considerations, it is plausible that the thermodynamically stable conﬁguration for x > 0.75 will consist of disordered arrangements of such rows.
This result may be related to the order-disorder transition re- ported at x = 0.75 from neutron diﬀraction experiments [3, 24].
Finally, for x = 1.0 all Na(2) sites are occupied (Fig. 2(o)).
In conclusion, we have carried out detailed DFT and model studies on the Na ordering mechanism in NaxCoO2.
The ordering pattern is non-trivial and is sensitive to the Na concentration.
The theoretically de- termined ordering patterns at various Na compositions agree well with those observed in recent electron diﬀrac- tion experiments[4].
In addition, we identify several ground states that have not yet been observed.
Our re- sults indicate that the primary driving force for the Na ordering is the screened electrostatic interactions.
De- tailed electronic structure on the CoO2 layer, on the other hand, plays no important role on the ordering of Na ions since the coupling between the CoO2 plane and the Na plane is much weaker than the intra-plane Na-Na interac- tions.
The converse eﬀects, however, could be signiﬁcant since the charge and magnetic orderings on the CoO2 plane happen at extremely low energy scale[5] and may be vulnerable to external perturbations.
Therefore, it is likely that the particularly stable Na ordering structure at x = 0.5 enhances the charge ordering tendency in the CoO2 layer, resulting in a charge ordered insulating state at low temperature as observed experimentally[2].
Con- versely, the nonexistence of such an insulating state at x = 2/3 may be due to the absence of an ordered honey- comb arrangement of Na ions at this composition.
