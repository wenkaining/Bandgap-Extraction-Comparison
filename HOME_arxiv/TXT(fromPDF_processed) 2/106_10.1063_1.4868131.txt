NEEL, F-38042 Grenoble, France 3)CEA, INAC, F-38054 Grenoble, France (Dated: 21 April 2022) We perform correlated studies of individual GaN nanowires in scanning electron microscopy combined to low temperature cathodoluminescence, microphotoluminescence and scanning transmission electron microscopy.
We show that some nanowires exhibit well localized regions emitting light at the energy of a stacking fault bound exciton (3.42 eV) and are able to observe the presence of a single stacking fault in these regions.
Precise measurements of the cathodoluminescence signal in the vicinity of the stacking fault gives access to the exciton diﬀusion length near this location.
Carrier diﬀusion length is a key quantity in optoelec- tronics, as it notably plays a signiﬁcant role in the com- petition between radiative and non-radiative processes, especially in materials with large densities of defects.
Concerning nitride semiconductors, various studies have established that carrier diﬀusion length in InGaN and GaN bidimensional (2D) layers are rather small, in the range of 50-250 nm1–7.
Such lengths are smaller than the typical distance between dislocations8, one among other possible reasons for the surprising eﬃciency of radiative recombination in InGaN quantum wells in spite of the high density of defects in current heterostructures.
With the aim of further eﬃciency improvement, a current trend in nitride optoelectronics research is to explore the poten- tial of nanowires (NWs) as building-blocks for light emis- sion or absorption devices.
This approach has already led to the realization of NW heterostructure-based light- emitting diodes (LEDs)9–12.
In the case of these pioneer- ing works, the small diameter of NWs raises the issue of the inﬂuence of size eﬀects on carrier diﬀusion.
More gen- erally, the issue of carrier diﬀusion length in GaN NWs is poorly documented to date.
Recent works13–15 sug- gest that recombinations are faster in InGaN nanorods than in 2D layers, which is correlated to a smaller car- rier diﬀusion length and has been tentatively assigned to possible surface damage.
In this letter we address the issue of exciton diﬀusion length in single GaN NWs with a diameter in the range of 100 nm.
For this purpose, low-temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) experiments have been performed on individual NWs in correlation with microphotoluminescence (µPL) and scanning trans- mission electron microscopy (STEM) studies that reveal the presence of I1 basal stacking faults (SFs).
It is well known from 2D-layer studies that such SFs are radiative recombination centers16–18.
Previous TEM/CL studies on GaN epilayers have already evidenced the correlation between the presence of diﬀerent types of SFs with well identiﬁed emission peaks16,17.
The density of structural a)Electronic mail: gilles.nogues@neel.cnrs.fr defects was relatively large in those samples.
In the case of our NWs, we show that emission peaks are linked to the presence of a single defect, acting as a quasi-punctual recombination center.
By varying the distance between the SF and the the CL excitation spot we investigate the diﬀusion length along the NW axis.
The nanowires are grown by Plasma-assisted Molecu- lar Beam Epitaxy (MBE) on a 2-inch Si(111) substrate.
Desoxydation of the silicon is done in situ by annealing at 950 ◦C until the clear appearance of the 7×7 surface reconstruction at 820 ◦C. The growth temperature, set at 820 ◦C, is determined by the measurement of the cor- responding Ga desorption time19,20.
A thin AlN buﬀer layer (2-3 nm thick) is grown directly onto the silicon.
Used as a seed layer for the GaN nanowires, it decreases the tilt of the NWs relative to the normal to the surface21.
This helps to obtain well separated nanowires, even for extensive growth time.
NWs were grown for 18 h in N- rich conditions (Ga/N ratio of 0.3)22.
They are L =3 µm long and their diameters range from 50 to 100 nm. 0 400 800 1200 1600 3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 counts (s-1) Energy (eV) #1 #2 #3 #1 #2 #3 (a) (c) (b) 2000 500 nm DAP D0X SFX FIG.

arXiv:1403.3886v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall]  16 Mar 20142 As grown NWs are mechanically dispersed onto 2 kinds of substrates.
Substrate S1 is used for CL and µPL stud- ies.
It is made of a Si wafer.
Localization marks are patterned by standard deep UV (DUV) optical lithog- raphy followed by reactive ion etching (RIE), using the resist as a mask.
It is then sputtered with a 100 nm- thick Al layer and a 20 nm-thick SiO2 layer.
For com- bined TEM and CL studies, substrate S2 consists of a home-made 35 nm thick Si3N4 membrane with a window size of 90 µm.
Arrays of nitride membranes are fabri- cated starting from a 200 µm thick Si (100) wafer with a layer of low stress Si3N4 of 35 nm on top of a 240 nm thick SiO2 layer on each side.
The fabrication procedure is described in Ref.23, with the diﬀerence that for these membranes the SiO2 layer is removed below the Si3N4 layer by RIE and a sequential KOH etch.
Optical DUV lithography and electron beam metallization are used to pattern Ti-Au markers on the membranes to locate the same NW in diﬀerent experiments.
CL images are taken at 5 K in a FEI scanning electron microscope (SEM) and analyzed through a 45 cm spectrometer and UV-optimized grating with 600 grooves/mm.
Figures 1(a-b) present simultaneously recorded SEM and CL images of 3 NWs on substrate S1.
The color scale of the CL image is set in order to show that light comes from the whole length of the NWs.
Nevertheless, a strong emission arises from 3 bright spots which saturate the image.
Figure 1(c) presents three spectra with a ﬁxed electron beam excitation at three locations (#1 to #3) shown on image 1(b).
The spec- trum #3 is representative of the emission from the whole length and is similar to the ensemble PL measurements on the as-grown sample.
One observes a peak at 3.48 eV that corresponds to the emission from neutral donor bound exciton (D0X) and a peak at 3.28 eV with its phonon replica at lower energy that are attibuted to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP).
Spectra #2 and #3 show that the bright spots are associated to an extra emission peak at 3.42 eV attributed to the emission from excitons trapped by stacking faults (SFX)16,24,25.
CL observa- tions allow us to locate well isolated NWs with SFX emis- sion that are further studied by microphotoluminescence.
µPL spectra are similar to Fig. 1(c) with a magnitude of the 3.42 eV peak slightly smaller or comparable to the D0X one.
This is well understood by considering that the laser excitation spot is larger than the NW and that the µPL spectrum integrates light emitted over its whole volume.
The linewidth of the D0X peak varies signiﬁ- cantly from one NW to the other between 2 and 20 meV, whereas the 3.42 eV peak linewidth is always in the 10- 20 meV range.
The larger linewidth of the 3.42 eV peak has been reported before26 and is still of unknown origin.
Further evidence of the correlation between the emis- sion at 3.42 eV and the presence of a SF is given by joint CL and STEM studies of the same NW on a S2 substrate.
A well isolated NW is ﬁrst identiﬁed in low- temperature CL [Figs. 2(b-d)].
It displays a localized emission at 3.42 eV near one of its tips. The D0X signal FIG. 2.

is more homogeneous, except for two areas where it is quenched.
One of them corresponds to the place where the 3.42 eV emission occurs, the other one is in the middle of the NW.
In Figure 2(a) a bright ﬁeld scanning TEM (BF STEM) image of the same NW is shown oriented along the [2-1-10] direction.
We note that between the two observations, the NW remained at the same location but rotated onto itself.
It explains why the small piece of GaN attached to the NW is at diﬀerent positions between Figs. 2(a) and (b).
The region marked by the red rect- angle in Fig. 2(a) is shown at higher magniﬁcation in BF STEM [Fig. 2(f)] and high angular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) STEM images [Fig. 2(e)] which reveal the presence of a stacking fault.
For sake of clarity it is indicated by an ar- row in both images, as well as a line following the stacking of the Ga columns in the 2H hexagonal wurtzite structure (ABABA.. stacking), that is disrupted by the insertion of one C plane (..ABABCAC.. stacking) characteristic of a cubic zinc blende phase.
Comparison of the CL and STEM data clearly shows that the 3.42 eV emission ex- hibits an excellent spatial correlation with the location of the SF.
On the other hand Fig. 2(g) shows a higher magniﬁcation BF STEM image of the region indicated with the blue rectangle in Fig 2(a), that is correlated with a quenching of D0X CL emission.
In this region we observe no feature indicating the presence of crystal defects.
A continuous smooth contrast over this region was conﬁrmed by high resolution STEM, as for the rest of the NW (not shown here).
The proﬁle of the CL signal along the NW longitudinal axis at 3.42 eV is therefore related to the probability for an exciton to be trapped by a single SF acting as a ra- diative recombination center.
We deﬁne nFX(x, t) (resp.
nD0X and nSFX) as the linear density of free excitons3 CL signal (linear scale) NW9 D0X 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 CL signal (log scale) x (nm) SFX FIG.

Dashed lines are exponential ﬁts with characterisctic length LNW indicated next to each line. (FX) (resp.
neutral donor and SF bound excitons) be- tween x and x + dx.
Extending the model of Corfdir et al.18, and using the same assumptions (absence of non-radiative decay channels and detrapping processes of bound excitons), one writes: ∂nFX ∂t = D∂2nFX ∂x2 + p(x) −  1 τr,FX + 4s d  nFX (1) −  1 τFX→D0X + 1 τFX→DAP + γFX→SFX(x)  nFX, where D is the diﬀusion constant of the FX in the ma- terial.
p(x) represents the excitation term.
It is assumed constant over the wire length in µPL.
On the contrary it is point like in the case of CL.
The FX population can decay either radiatively, with time τr,FX, or through surface eﬀect, s being the surface recombination velocity and d the NW diameter27.
The last line of Eq. 1 corre- sponds to the trapping of free excitons by neutral donors (characteristic time τFX→D0X), DAPs (τFX→DAP) or the SF.
In the latter case, γFX→SFX(x) has a non zero value 1/τ 0 F X→SF X only close to the SF, with a characteristic extension wSF.
In the same manner one has: ∂nD0X ∂t = nFX τFX→D0X −nD0X τr,D0X , (2) ∂nSFX ∂t = γFX→SFX(x)nFX −nSFX τr,SFX , (3) where τr,D0X (resp.
τr,SFX) is the radiative decay time of the neutral donor (resp.
stacking fault) bound exci- ton.
The total SFX (resp.
D0X) ﬂuorescence signal is R L/2 −L/2 nSFX/τr,SFXdx (resp. R nD0X/τr,D0X).
µPL obser- vations show that their stationnary values have the same amplitude.
Hence the SF capture rate is dramatically larger than the one of the neutral donors, in agreement with the results of Ref.18. From Eqs. 2 and 3, one in- fers τ 0 FX→SFX ≃τFX→D0X ∗wSF/L. Using a SF capture range24 wSF =3 nm, 1/τ 0 F X→SF X is 300 times larger than the capture rate by neutral donors.
We now assume a single NW extending from −L/2 to L/2 and containing a single SF at x = 0.
It is excited at position xp by the electron beam, p(x) = p0δ(x −xp).
Outside the SF capture range, the stationnary solution to Eq. 1 is nFX(x) = n0 exp(−|x−xp|/LNW), where LNW = √Dτeﬀis the diﬀusion length in the NW, with: 1 τeﬀ = 1 τr,FX + 4s d + 1 τFX→D0X + 1 τFX→DAP .
(4) Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments in en- semble of GaN nanorods reported τr,FX ≃100 ps28,29 and s =2.7 104 cm/s13,14.
In the set of NWs we have studied d =110±10 nm.
Hence the two ﬁrst terms of Eq. 4 con- tribute with the same magnitude to the eﬀective decay rate of the FX.
The capture rate by neutral donors or DAPs depends on their density.
For pure undoped thick layers of GaN, CL experiments report exciton diﬀusion lengths in the vicinity of threading dislocations ranging from L2D=8130 to 201 nm31.
In our NW sample, the absence of a peak at the FX energy and the presence of D0X and DAP peaks in the spectra let us infer that the capture rate 1/τFX→D0X + 1/τFX→DAP is larger than the radiative or surface decay terms.
Close to a SF, the eﬀective decay rate 1/τeﬀis domi- nated by the SF capture rate 1/τ 0 FX→SFX, which is L/wSF larger than the D0X capture rate.
The corresponding dif- fusion length is therefore divided by a factor p L/wSF.
It is in the 10 nm range, of the same order of magnitude as wSF.
This means that a large fraction of incoming excitons is trapped by the SF and later converted into a photon.
The SF ﬂuorescence signal is therefore propor- tional to nFX(x = 0) = n0 exp(−|xp|/LNW).
Figures 3(b) and (d) plot the CL signal in logscale as a function of the longitudinal wire coordinate x for two diﬀerent NWs on a S1 substrate.
The peaks are well ﬁt- ted by convoluting an exponential decay with a Gaussian function of width wp=30±10 nm for electron acceleration4 voltages V ≥10 kV.
This is larger than wSF and rather reﬂects the size of the excitation region by the electron beam.
For V =5 kV, wp is degraded to 70 nm.
We at- tribute this eﬀect to backscattered electrons in the NW at lower energy.
At distances larger than wp from the peak center, the tails on each side are well ﬁtted by expo- nential functions with characteristic length LNW (dashed lines).
Average of LNW measured for an ensemble of 12 NWs gives LNW=68±16 nm< L2D.
Based on the previ- ous discussion, it conﬁrms that the capture by of neutral donors or DAP dominates the FX eﬀective decay rate.
We also observe a large dispersion on the values of LNW, with sometimes abrupt changes like around x =800 nm on Fig. 3(d).
This is evidence of long range variations of 1/τeﬀ.
The latter can arise from changes of the density of neutral donors or DAPs or the presence of an extra non radiative decay term −nFX/τnr,FX(x) in Eq. 1 due to other kind of impurities.
Further evidence of long range variations of the NW parameters is given by the CL signal at the D0X emission energy [Figures 3(a) and (c)].
Its amplitude variations can only be accounted for if one assumes that τFX→D0X varies along the wire length or if one adds an extra non radiative decay term −nD0X/τnr,D0X(x) to Eq. 2 due to the trapping of the D0X by other defects.
For example, a SF can capture excitons from the neighboring neutral donors18 resulting in a localized quenching area [arrows on Figs. 3(a,c)].
However, we also observe extended NW areas where a partial quenching of the signal occurs.
This can only happen if the previously introduced capture or decay rates experience long range variations and are not just point-like as for the SF defects.
We observe no clear correlation between the D0X signal magnitude and LNW .
This means that 1/τeﬀis determined by other parameters like DAP capture rate or non radiative decay.
In conclusion, we are able to observe single SFs present in individual NWs with diﬀerent optical and structural techniques.
The CL proﬁle in the vicinity of a SF is well understood by a simple diﬀusion model of the exciton.
