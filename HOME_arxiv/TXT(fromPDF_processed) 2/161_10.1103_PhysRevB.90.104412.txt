PACS codes: 75.25.-j, 75.30.Et, 75.30.Kz2    Abstract  We have carried out high magnetic field studies of single-crystalline Li2MnO3, a  honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet.
Its magnetic phase diagram was mapped out using  magnetization measurements at applied fields up to 35 T. Our results show that it undergoes two  successive meta-magnetic transitions around 9 T fields applied perpendicular to the ab-plane  (along the c*-axis).
These phase transitions are completely absent in the magnetization measured  with field applied along the ab-plane.
In order to understand this magnetic phase diagram, we  developed a mean-field model starting from the correct Néel-type magnetic structure, consistent  with our single crystal neutron diffraction data at zero field.
Our model calculations succeeded in  explaining the two meta-magnetic transitions that arise when Li2MnO3 enters two different spin- flop phases from the zero field Néel phase. 1.
Introduction The honeycomb lattice has the smallest number of (three) nearest neighbors that is  possible for two dimensional systems.
Materials with the honeycomb lattice structure have  attracted considerable interest over the years in the condensed matter community, not least for  the discovery of massless Dirac fermions in graphene.1,2 At the same time, honeycomb lattice  consisting of magnetic ions are the focus of some interesting ideas such as the Kitaev model,3  wherein frustrated, directional anisotropic nearest neighbor interactions yield a spin liquid  ground state from which exotic quasiparticles called anyons may emerge.
Moreover, these may  serve as the basis for fault-tolerant quantum computers.4 Another interesting quantum spin liquid  phase was also reported for the Hubbard Model on a honeycomb lattice,5 whilst a topological  insulating state has been discussed in cases where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is sufficiently3    strong, such as Na2IrO3.6,7     Honeycomb lattice compounds containing Ir4+ ions (such as Li2IrO3 and Na2IrO3), with a  large SOC leading to an effective total angular momentum, Jeff = 1/2,8-12 have drawn both  theoretical and experimental interests in recent years, as they are seen to be probable test beds for  the Kitaev model.
Nevertheless, these A2IrO3 compounds (with A = Li and Na) differ from the  ideal Kitaev model in that isotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions, arising mainly from direct  exchange between nearest neighbor Ir-ions, compete with the directional anisotropic Kitaev  interactions.
The ground state of such a Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model may be one of two spin- liquid or four long-range ordered phases depending on the relative strengths of the Kitaev and  the Heisenberg interactions,13 whilst the A2IrO3 systems were identified to be long-range ordered  zigzag-type antiferromagnets (AFMs).14,15 In order to understand better the physics of the honeycomb lattice at a strong SOC limit,  it can be a useful and, at the same time, interesting exercise to investigate honeycomb lattice  materials at a weak SOC limit.
This is an approach we adopted here by examining Li2MnO3 of  such an example thoroughly.
Li2MnO3 also belongs to the “213” honeycomb structure family of  compounds16 with the general formula A2TMO3.17 It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space  group.
Due to its interesting electrochemical activity,18 Li2MnO3 has been widely studied for  applications in Li-batteries.
Below the Néel temperature, TN = 36.5 K, Li2MnO3 exhibits an  antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments of Mn4+  ions.19 As shown in Fig. 1(a), it has  an alternate stacking of a layer of Li(1)O6 octahedron occupying the center of a honeycomb-like  structure formed by MnO6 edge sharing octahedrons and another layer of Li(2)O6 and Li(3)O64    edge sharing octahedrons.
The Mn4+ ions in Li2MnO3 occupying the centers of MnO6  octahedrons set up a modified honeycomb lattice network (in the top and bottom ab-planes)  which fairly mimics the 2D-honeycomb lattice structure of graphene.
Therefore, both Mn–O–Mn  super-exchange and Mn–Mn Heisenberg direct exchange interactions are simultaneously  possible in the ab-plane of Li2MnO3 [see Fig. 1(b)].
Because the MnO6 layers are well separated  by the LiO6 octahedral layer, Li2MnO3 exhibits magnetic properties that are quasi-2D in nature.
The antiferromagnetic ordering of Li2MnO3 single crystal and some of its physical properties  have already been reported.20 In this paper, we present our experimental investigations on the  magnetic spin structure and magnetic field (H) induced spin-flop (SF) phase transition of  Li2MnO3 single crystal.
We construct a full H-T phase diagram from the field, temperature (T)  dependent magnetization and the SF transitions of Li2MnO3 single crystal measured up to 35 T.
The experimental results are compared with the results of mean field model calculations based  on a simple Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a single ion anisotropy term. 2.
Experimental and computational methods The Li2MnO3 single crystals were grown by a two-step flux method.20 In the first step,  polycrystalline Li2MnO3 powder was prepared from Li2CO3 (99.997 %) and MnO2 (99.99 %).
The stoichiometrically mixed starting materials (with 10 mol% of excess Li2CO3) were pressed  into a pellet and placed in an alumina crucible for heat treatments.
A high temperature solid state  reaction was carried out by heating the pellet to 1027 °C at the rate of 100 °C/h and dwelling for  48 h.
Thereafter the polycrystalline Li2MnO3 sample was cooled to room temperature at the rate  of 60 °C/h.
The sample was examined for phase purity and crystallinity using a  table-top X-ray  diffractometer (Rigaku Miniflex II).
In the second step, polycrystalline Li2MnO3 powder was5    mixed in a plastic bottle with the flux (Li2CO3 premixed with finely ground B2O3) in the molar  ratio of 1:(2.76:2.39) respectively.
This mixture was transferred to a platinum (Pt) crucible and  closed using a suitable Pt-lid.
The Li2MnO3 single crystals were grown in the Pt-crucible using  the following heating profile: (i) heating from room temperature (RT) to 1092 °C at the rate of  100 °C/h, (ii) dwelling at 1092 °C for 10 h, (iii) cooling to 720 °C at the rate of 2 °C/h, (iv)  dwelling at 720 °C for a short period of 10 minutes and (v) natural cooling to RT (by turning the  furnace off).
Single crystal neutron diffraction (ND) data of Li2MnO3 at 10 K was collected using a  four circle diffractometer (FCD) having Ge (3 1 1) monochromator and with neutron beam of  wavelength, λn = 1.8343 Å (HANARO reactor, Korea).
The ND data was fitted using the  FullProf program for different probable magnetic structure models.21,22 High field magnetization  at different temperatures was measured using the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  (NHMFL), Florida (USA), with applied fields up to 35 T. Additional detailed temperature- dependent magnetization measurements were carried out up to 14 T using the vibrating sample  magnetometer (VSM) option of a physical property measurement system (PPMS), Quantum  Design.
We also performed mean-field model calculations for the magnetization of Li2MnO3  single crystal using the McPhase software suite.23    3.
Results  3.1 Magnetic structure of Li2MnO3  As stated in the introduction, the antiferromagnetic structure of Li2MnO3 has already  been reported by Lee et al.20 However, following a recent report24 that presents a contradicting6    Cx-type AFM model structure that is claimed to fit the muon-spin rotation and relaxation (μ+SR)  experimental data, we were prompted to reinvestigate the magnetic structure of Li2MnO3 using  the single crystal ND data: we measured 320 magnetic Bragg peaks and used 221 independent  peaks in our analysis.
We attempted to fit the experimental ND data (collected at 10 K) using the  following magnetic model structures: Fx, Fy, Fxz (Fz), Cx, Cy, and Cxz (Cz) -type AFMs.
Here, the  symbols F and C denote, respectively, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic arrangements  (interalayer coupling) of magnetic moments in the ab-plane with AFM interlayer coupling  between any two successive ab-planes along the c-axis.
The direction of the magnetic moments  are indicated by the symbols x, y, z and xz corresponding to the crystallographic a-, b-, c- axes  and the ac-plane of Li2MnO3 respectively.
The Fy, Fxz, Cy and Cxz magnetic model structures  have, respectively, the Γ1g, Γ3g, Γ4u and Γ2u symmetry.20 With the Cxz-type AFM spin structure,  we obtained a best agreement between calculated structure factor (F2 calc) and observed structure  factor (F2 obs) of Li2MnO3.
A schematic drawing of the Cxz-type AFM spin structure is shown in  Fig 2 together with our fitting results for all other models for references.
Thus, we again confirm  that the magnetic structure of Li2MnO3 is Cxz-type AFM with the Γ2u symmetry.
In Li2MnO3, in addition to the nearest neighbor AFM coupling in the ab-plane, the  magnetic moments have antiferromagnetic (interlayer) coupling along the c-axis which doubles  the c-axis length of the magnetic unit cell with respect to that of the crystallographic (or chemical)  unit cell.
The refined magnetic moment per Mn4+ ion [μord ≈ 2.29(1) μB] has 0.67(3), 0 and  2.43(1) μB as the components along the a-, b- and c- axes of the unit cell, respectively.
Since the  magnetic structure requires a strong nearest neighbor (J1) antiferromagnetic interaction and the  nearest neighbor Mn–Mn distance is close (~2.8 Å), it is likely that the direct exchange7    interaction dominates over the probable Mn–O–Mn superexchange interaction which may be  weak and ferromagnetic, due to the Mn–O–Mn bond angle (~96°) being close to 90°.25    3.2 High field magnetization of Li2MnO3 The magnetization of Li2MnO3 single crystal was measured at different temperatures  with external magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane i.e., parallel and  perpendicular to the reciprocal lattice vector, c*.
Figure 3(a) shows the variation of M with H ^  ab-plane (H  c*-axis).
At low temperatures (T < TN), there are two field-induced magnetic  phase transitions where the magnetization shows a sharp, nonlinear increase with increasing H.
No such features were observed with H  ab-plane (H ^ c*) at any temperature, as shown in  Fig. 3(b), indicative of spin flop transitions.26,27 Accordingly we call the corresponding transition  fields spin flop fields, HSF1 and HSF2 respectively.
As seen from Fig. 3(a), the values of HSF1 and  HSF2 increase with T up to TN.
Figure 3(c) shows an expanded view of M measured at different  temperatures for both increasing and decreasing H ^ ab-plane (H  c*), illustrating the  hysteretic behavior of the SF transitions between HSF1 and HSF2.
Interestingly, M measured at 2,  5 and 10 K show two clear hysteresis loops, with one that is closer to the HSF2 enclosing a  relatively lower area than the other that is closer to HSF1.
The hysteresis loops in the M vs H data  indicate first order phase transitions.25    Figure 4 shows the temperature dependent magnetization of Li2MnO3 single crystal  measured using field-cooled warming protocol with various constant magnetic fields applied  perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane (i.e., parallel and perpendicular to c*-axis).
The M vs  T curve measured at H = 0.03 T shows a broad maximum around 50 K and a kink at TN ≈ 36.5 K,8    which is more clearly seen for H  c* than for H ^ c*.
As the applied external magnetic field  is increased, TN gradually decreases.
Below TN, a minimum is observed in the magnetization for     H || c* > 8.5 T and it shifts to higher temperature with increasing field until H > 11 T, where no  clear (or sharp) minimum can be seen.
At higher fields, for example H = 14 T, the changes in  magnetization corresponding to both H || c* and H ^ c* appear to be very similar.
The minima in  M are due to the SF transitions corresponding to the specific values of H ^ ab-plane (i.e., H || c*),  because these occur only for H applied (nearly) parallel / antiparallel to the direction of the  magnetic moments (μ) of an antiferromagnet with low anisotropy27 and not for H ^ μ.
We note  here that, in principle, the SF transitions can be either first order or second order.28    3.3 Magnetic phase diagram of Li2MnO3 As shown in Fig. 5, we construct a magnetic phase diagram based on the experimental  results: the variation of TN with H (¥-symbol), and the SF transition fields (HSF1 and HSF2)  obtained from M vs H, hysteresis measurements (▲- and ▼- symbols) and the M vs T curves at  different fixed H || c* (■- and -symbols).
The transition from paramagnetic (PM) phase to the  antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is a second-order phase transition whose transition temperature  (TN) decreases with increasing H. For T << TN, the AFM phase is separated from the SF phase by  two first-order phase boundary lines (indicated by ▲-, ▼-, ■- and - symbols).
The lines  connecting those data points are guides to the eyes.
The inset of Fig. 5 (an expanded view of the  phase diagram) shows the trend of merging first-order HSF1 and HSF2 boundary lines and joining  the second-order PM-AFM/SF phase boundary line.
The merging point [(10 < Ht < 11 T), T ≈ TN  (Ht)] is a tri-critical point in the H-T diagram of Li2MnO3 which connects the PM, AFM and SF  phases.
Whilst the high field SF phase should have magnetic moments in the ab-plane, the9    structure of the intermediate phase (at HSF1 < H < HSF2) was unclear, leading us to perform a  mean field analysis.
3.4 Mean field analysis and the spin-flop transition of Li2MnO3  The essential features of the observed SF transitions and some other physical properties  of Li2MnO3 may be described by a spin, S = 3/2 Heisenberg model with weak easy axis  anisotropy (along c*-axis), using the following Hamiltonian:  2 1 2 3 . . . . . . . .
1 ( ) 2 z i j i j i j c i j i n n n n n n n c i H J J J J K S ⎡ ⎤ = − • + • + • + • − ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ S S S S S S S S (1),                  where the summations run over nearest- (n.), next-nearest (n.n.), and next-next-nearest (n.n.n.)  neighbor (ith  and jth) Mn-ions in the ab-plane, and nearest neighbors along the c-direction (n.c.)  with associated exchange parameters J1, J2, J3 and Jc respectively (as shown in Fig. 1b), and K is  the single ion anisotropy parameter.
As a first step, a single spin-flop transition can be produced  by a simplified model with only non-zero J1 and K, which may be uniquely defined by the Néel  temperature and the critical field value.
But, the observed two spin flop transitions require an  additional, small, non-zero Jc.
While the interlayer interaction (Jc) is necessary for the Cxz-type  AFM spin structure it also stabilizes an intermediate field structure, wherein only moments on  the alternate ab-planes have flopped, as illustrated in Fig. 5.
The magnitude of Jc determines the  difference between the spin-flop fields (HSF2−HSF1), and thus may be fixed by the experimental  results.
Since the next- and next-next -nearest neighbor interalayer interactions (J2 and J3) and  the interlayer interaction (Jc) likely share similar Mn–O–Li–O–Mn super-exchange pathways  that are separated by almost the same distances, they should, a priori, be of similar magnitude.
Therefore, we have fixed the values of J2 and J3 at twice the magnitude of Jc.
Unfortunately this  produces a large change in the magnetization at the spin flop transition that is calculated to be10    approximately twice the measured values.
In order to reduce this and to match with the  experimentally observed change in the magnetization, we need larger unphysical values of J2 or  J3.
Given the above constraints, we found that the following set of exchange and anisotropy  constants explains our data better: J1 = −0.84 meV, J2 = J3 = −0.02 meV, Jc = −0.01 meV, and  K = −0.067 meV.
The calculated magnetization is shown as dashed lines (MFCs) in Fig. 3(a,b,c)  and Fig. 4, and the calculated magnetic phase diagram is given by the background in Fig. 5.
The  spin-flop transitions are calculated to be first order at low temperatures, which is consistent with  the experimental observations, and apparently merging at T ≈ 16 K. Above this temperature, as a  function of increasing field, the moments rotate smoothly from being perpendicular to the ab- plane to parallel to the ab-plane, reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point.
However, although the  agreement between the theoretical calculations and the experimental results are reasonably good,  there are clear disagreements too.
A most noticeable case is that the calculated magnetization is  bigger than the experimental field dependence of the magnetization data shown in Fig. 3.
We  have tested several alternative models by varying values of J and K to resolve this discrepancy  before coming to a conclusion that the magnetic moment of Mn ions may as well be effectively  smaller in the real material than the spin-only ionic value (3 µB).
In fact, the ordered moment  determined by the ND refinements is not 3 μB but ~2.3 μB. This is strong evidence that supports  our idea.
Moreover, short-ranged fluctuations, often present in two-dimensional spin systems,  can reduce the effective spin value too, which, in principle, cannot be accounted in mean-field  calculations.
Therefore, we repeated the calculations using the following set of parameters for a  spin, S = 1 model: J1 = −1.55 meV, J2 = J3 = −0.02 meV, Jc = −0.025 meV, and K = −0.10911    meV.
The results of the MFCs using S = 1 are shown by the dashed-symbol lines in Fig. 3 which  exhibits significant improvement over that of MFCs using S = 3/2.
(See also calculated M(T)  results in Fig. 4).
However, we note that the overall phase diagram remains almost unchanged  when compared to that for the S = 3/2 case.
The magnetic structures presented in Fig. 5 are the  results of our mean-field calculations, and that corresponding to the low-field region in the H-T  phase diagram is indeed consistent with our analysis of the experimental data as shown in Figs. 1  and 2.    4.
Discussions  It is well known that the SF occurs if an external magnetic field of sufficient strength is  applied parallel to one of the two sub-lattice magnetic moments of an antiferromagnet with a  small anisotropy of easy axis of magnetization.26,27 The whole process of SF is an act of reducing  the energy of the system which, otherwise, is higher if one of the AFM sub-lattice’s moments  point antiparallel to a sufficiently strong H. The spin-flop transition in Li2MnO3 single crystal  occurs in two steps.
In first step, when an external magnetic field of strength H ≥ HSF1 (< HSF2) is  present, only the spins of the alternate ab-planes flop, because the spin-flop occurs against the  single ion anisotropy (SIA) term (K) which adds additional energy if the spins in all the ab- planes flop for the same strength of H. Eventually, the interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange  interaction (Jc) is weakened in the presence of a strong magnetic field.
In second step, when H is  increased further to H ≥ HSF2 (< HFM), the spins of the other alternate ab-planes also flop  because this reduces the total energy of the system (even though it would add a little energy due  to K).
Here, HFM is a possible (hypothetical) field of unknown strength, such that for H ≥ HFM >>  HSF2, all the spins in all the ab-planes flip to align parallel to H and establish a field-induced  ferromagnetic (FM) phase.
Inspecting the high field magnetization data shown in Fig. 3a, we12    estimate HFM to be in the range of 70 – 100 T.
In fact, it is interesting to note that a FM spin-structure in a honeycomb lattice system  (even though a classical ground state) is another possible magnetic phase of the HK model13,29  that is widely studied at present.
It may be possible to observe a field-induced FM phase in a  honeycomb lattice system (e.g., Li2MnO3 or a similar one) at extremely high magnetic fields.
We  observe that the search for honeycomb lattice systems with such field-induced FM phase or FM  ground state may lead to the emergence of new applications of magnetism in honeycomb lattice.
Perhaps, this is achievable in some new materials with similar structure or materials that offer  honeycomb lattice for magnetic ions and have strong single ion anisotropy.
A modified Kitaev  Hamiltonian, introduced by Baskaran et al., has been shown exactly solvable for all half-odd- integer spins and commented as “it is equivalent to an exponentially large number of copies of  spin-1/2  Kitaev Hamiltonians”.30 This modified spin-S Kitaev Hamiltonian may be thought to  replace the original Kitaev interaction terms of the currently considered HK model, so that the  modified HK model would be more general and may be applicable to any real honeycomb lattice  materials with high spins (S > 1/2) also, such as Li2MnO3.
By our high field magnetization studies of Li2MnO3 single crystal and the mean field  model calculations, we found that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction (Jc) along the c-axis  is exhibiting a distinguishable feature in the magnetization and SF transition.
This finding is  important since the inter-layer coupling is mostly neglected in theoretical studies of the magnetic  phase diagram of honeycomb lattice systems.
Overall, what we found is that it is essential to  comprehend the field-induced phase, which, we think, may well be relevant for other magnetic13    honeycomb lattice systems.
Further, besides the fact that the spins of Mn4+ ions in Li2MnO3 can  be treated effectively as classical spins, its Néel-type AFM spin-structure may be thought of one  of the classical ground states of HK model with Kitaev interaction of negligible or effectively  zero strength relative to the strength of isotropic Heisenberg interaction.
This is justifiable  because in the HK model reported by Chaloupka et al., the Néel-type AFM phase exists for a  wide range of “φ” (−34° < φ < 88°), where φ is a phase angle determined by the relative strength  of the Kitaev term (2K) with respect to the Heisenberg term (J): φ ൌcosିଵ൬ J ඥKమାJమ൰.13 Our  analysis discussed so far suggests that the Kitaev term should be very small for Li2MnO3  compared with the Heisenberg term.
Thus, the phase angle (φ) is almost zero for Li2MnO3,  which produces the Néel phase according to the theoretical results in Refs.
13 and 29: which is in  good agreement with our experimental results.
What is particularly interesting about our data  regarding the general phase diagram of the HK model is the newly discovered field-induced  spin-flop phases and the ferromagnetic (FM) phase.
First of all, there is no theoretical prediction  available at the moment for the HK Hamiltonian plus a Zeeman term so we cannot make a direct  comparison with our data.
However, it is intriguing that in all theoretical phase diagrams of Refs.
13 and 29 the magnetic structure we found for the spin-flop phase is not found to be stable.
Second, our high field data demonstrate that one can adiabatically move from the Néel phase to  the FM phase.
Therefore, it will be highly interesting to examine the thermodynamics of the HK  Hamiltonian plus a Zeeman term as a function of magnetic field.
Thus far we believe that our  experimental works demonstrated that there is more for future developments, which could offer  much better understandings on the magnetism of honeycomb lattice systems with any spin-S.    5.
Summary and conclusion14    In summary, we have investigated Li2MnO3 single crystal as a test bed for the physics of  magnetism in honeycomb lattice at a weak SOC limit as it offers a honeycomb lattice for Mn4+  ions with spin, S = 3/2.
Li2MnO3 has a classical Néel ordered Cxz-type antiferromagnetic spin  structure (Γ2u symmetry).
The refined resultant magnetic moment per Mn4+ ion is μord ≈ 2.29(1)  μB, reduced from the spin-only ionic value (3 μB) probably because of the two-dimensional  nature of the honeycomb lattice.
Further, we have studied high field magnetization of Li2MnO3  single crystal for magnetic fields up to 35 T applied both parallel and perpendicular to the ab- planes.
Li2MnO3 is seen to exhibit two successive magnetic field induced spin-flop phase  transitions at T < TN.
A magnetic phase diagram of Li2MnO3 single crystal has been constructed  using the high field- and temperature- dependent magnetization data.
The spin-flop phase  transition and the other magnetization properties of Li2MnO3 single crystal can be described well  by a honeycomb lattice system of an effective spin, S = 1 model based on a simple Heisenberg  exchange interaction Hamiltonian with a single ion anisotropy term.
In the mean field analysis,  the spin-flop transition has been found to occur in two successive first-order phase transitions at  lower temperatures; surprisingly, the inter-layer coupling is seen to play an essential role for the  spin-flop transition.
This is seen to have good agreement with the two hysteresis loops observed  in our M vs H data.

Figure captions  FIG.
1. (Color online) (a) A polyhedral view of Li2MnO3 single crystal (viewed perpendicular to  the ab-plane).
(b) The Cxz-type antiferromagnetic spin structure (unit cell) of Li2MnO3 with only17    Mn atoms shown for better clarity.
The nearest-, next-nearest- and next-next-nearest neighbor  exchange interactions (J1, J2 and J3) between Mn atoms in the ab-plane are shown by double  headed solid, dashed and dotted arrows, respectively.
The possible exchange interaction along  the c-axis (Jc) is shown by a double headed dashed-dotted arrow. FIG.
2. (Color online) Result of magnetic structure refinements using neutron diffraction data of  Li2MnO3 single crystal.
The dashed lines in each graph are the reference lines of perfect match  between the squared observed (F2 obs) and calculated (F2 cal) structure factors.
Schematic diagrams  are given for each magnetic structures used in the refinement. FIG.
3. (Color online) Variation of high field magnetization of Li2MnO3 single crystal with  magnetic field applied (a) parallel and (b) perpendicular to c*-axis measured (only for decreasing  field) at different temperatures.
(c) An expanded view of high field magnetization measured for  both increasing and decreasing field applied parallel to c*-axis.
The corresponding magnetization  calculated using mean field models (MFC) having spin S = 3/2 and S = 1 are shown by dashed  lines and dashed-symbol lines respectively.    FIG.
4. (Color online) Temperature dependence of magnetization of Li2MnO3 single crystal  measured for different values of magnetic field applied both parallel and perpendicular to c*-axis.
In this picture, unless specified otherwise, the direction of the magnetic field is parallel to c*-axis.18    The corresponding magnetization calculated using mean field models (MFC) having spin S = 3/2  and S = 1 are shown by dashed lines and dashed-symbol lines respectively.    FIG.
5. (Color online) Magnetic phase diagram of Li2MnO3 single crystal.
The data points are  derived from the experimental magnetization measured at either fixed temperatures (▲ and ▼  symbols) or fields (■ and  symbols) while sweeping the other parameter.
(The lines connecting  the data points are guides to the eyes.) The phase diagram constructed from our mean field  model calculations (shaded area) is shown as the background for the phase diagram of  experimental data.
The magnetic spin structures of the ordered AFM (obtained from the analysis  of experimental single crystal neutron diffraction data), spin flop (SF) and intermediate SF  phases (obtained in the mean field analysis) are also shown.
The inset shows an expanded view  of the phase diagrams with a trend of merging first-order HSF1 and HSF2 boundary lines and  joining the second-order PM-AFM/SF phase boundary line.19    Figures      FIG. 120      FIG. 221          FIG. 322      FIG. 423      FIG. 5
