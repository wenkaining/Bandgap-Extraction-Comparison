Chakhalian2 1Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo 315201, China 2Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA (Dated: November 2, 2018) Almost all oxide two-dimensional electron gases are formed in SrTiO3-based heterostructures and the study of non-SrTiO3 systems is extremely rare.
Here, we report the realization of a two-dimensional electron gas in a CaTiO3-based heterostructure, CaTiO3/LaTiO3, grown epitaxially layer-by-layer on a NdGaO3 (110) substrate via pulsed laser deposition.
The high quality of the crystal and electronic structures are characterized by in-situ reﬂection high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy.
Measure- ment of electrical transport validates the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas in the CaTiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice.
It is revealed the room-temperature carrier mobility in CaTiO3/LaTiO3 is nearly 3 times higher than in CaTiO3/YTiO3, demonstrating the effect of TiO6 octahedral tilts and rotations on carrier mobility of two-dimensional electron gases.
Due to doped CaTiO3 being an A-site polar metal, our results provide a new route to design novel A-site two-dimensional polar metals.
The entanglement among charge, spin, orbital, and struc- tural degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides leads to a great number of emergent phenomena, one remarkable ex- ample of which is the formation of a two-dimensional elec- tron gas (2DEG) at the interface of two insulating compounds, e.g., SrTiO3/LaAlO3,1,2 SrTiO3/γ-Al2O3,3,4 SrTiO3/RTiO3 (R = La, Gd, Nd),5–8 SrTiO3/LaVO3,9 SrTiO3/LaGaO3,10 and SrTiO3/DyScO3.11 Quantum many-body effects at the inter- faces of transition metal oxides beneﬁt the formation of two- dimensional polar metals, magnetic 2DEGs, and the coexis- tence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism.12–17 On the other hand, strong correlations result in the room-temperature carrier mobilities of SrTiO3-based 2DEGs being ultra-low (0.1–10 cm2V−1s−1),18 which hinders their practical applica- tions for advanced electronic devices.
As seen, almost all per- ovskite oxide 2DEGs are found in SrTiO3-based heterostruc- tures, the two unique exceptions being KTaO3/LaTiO3 and CaTiO3/YTiO3.19,20 Therefore, the study of non-SrTiO3 sys- tems is thus essential, but essentially lacking thus far.
To address this issue, we focus the study of CaTiO3- based heterostructures.
Here, we take the heterostructure CaTiO3/LaTiO3 [CTO/LTO, see Fig. 1(a)] as a prototype to investigate the effect of TiO6 octahedra on carrier mo- bility by comparing its properties with the heterostructure CaTiO3/YTiO3 [CTO/YTO, see Fig. 1(b)].20 As seen in Fig. 1(c), in bulk LTO the Ti–O–Ti bond angle α is 157◦, whereas it is only 144◦in YTO, which results in a larger conduction band width of LTO (2.45 eV) than of YTO (2.04 eV).21 The Ti–O–Ti bond angle can play a key role in determining the electrical transport properties,22 and is ex- pected to lead to a higher carrier mobility in CTO/LTO than in CTO/YTO.
Here, the material LTO is carefully selected for the reason that its bond angle is very close to that of bulk CTO (∼156◦).23,24 Moreover, the lattice parameters of bulk CTO at room temperature a = 5.38 ˚A, b = 5.44 ˚A, c = 7.64 ˚A (in the or- thorhombic setting) are well-matched with the lattice param- eters of the NdGaO3 (NGO) substrate a = 5.43 ˚A, b = 5.50 ˚A, c = 7.71 ˚A.25 In this Letter, we report the layer-by-layer synthesis of high quality CTO/LTO superlattices by pulsed laser deposi- tion (PLD).
The high quality of the crystal and electronic structures are characterized by reﬂection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).

The superlattices [3 u.c.
CTO/3 u.c. LTO]7 [u.c. = pseu- docubic unit cells, see Fig. 2(a)] were synthesized on (110)- oriented NGO (orthorhombic notation) single crystal sub- strates (5 × 5 × 0.5 mm3) by PLD using a KrF excimer laser operating at λ = 248 nm and a pulse rate of 2 Hz.
The details of growth parameters can be found in our previous reports on CTO ﬁlms and CTO/YTO heterostructures.20,26 The high quality of the ﬁlms was conﬁrmed by both in-situ RHEED and ex-situ XRD (Cu Kα1, λ = 1.5406 ˚A).
To investigate the elec- tronic structure, composition, and valence states of the ﬁlms, XPS (monochromated Al Kα radiation, hν = 1486.6 eV) was 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 O 1s Ti 2s Ti 2p Ca 2s Ca 2p C 1s La 4p La 4d Ti 3s Ti 3p Binding energy (eV) Intensity (a.u.)

Sheet resistances and Hall effect were measured between 2 and 300 K using a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design PPMS EverCool-II) in the van der Pauw geometry.
Figure 2 shows the crystal structure of the 3CTO/3LTO ﬁlm.
As seen in Fig. 2 (b-d), sharp RHEED patterns from the CTO and LTO layers during epitaxy indicate layer-by- layer growth of 3CTO/3LTO superlattices.
The observation of clear half order peaks [white arrows in Fig. 2 (b-d)] con- ﬁrms the orthorhombic symmetry of the ﬁlm.
To further in- vestigate the structural details of the sample, we performed XRD ω–2θ scan measurements on the sample.
As seen from the wide range ω–2θ scan curve shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (e), no secondary phase is observed.
Around the sharp peak from the NGO substrate at 2θ = 47.06◦, a broad ﬁlm peak [indicated by a triangle in Fig. 2 (e)] with Kiessig fringes can be observed, further conﬁrming the crystallinity of the super- lattices.
By ﬁtting of the Kiessig fringes [see Fig. 2 (e)], the thickness of the ﬁlm is estimated to be 15.2 nm, consistent with the expected value 16.2 nm.
Next, to investigate the chemical composition and valence states of the ﬁlm, we carried out XPS at acceptance angles of 90◦with the greatest penetration depth and 45◦with domi- nant surface contribution.
Figure 3 (a) shows a wide-energy3 XPS spectrum from 0 to 600 eV. As seen, no discernable im- purity signal is observed besides adsorbed carbon on the ﬁlm surface.
Next, we focus on the charge states of titantum in 3CTO/3LTO.
As displayed in Fig. 3 (b), the dominant fea- ture of the Ti 2p XPS spectra is doublet states.
The two main peaks at 464.9 eV and 459.1 eV are assigned to Ti4+ 2p1/2 and Ti4 + 2p3/2 peaks, respectively.
Shoulders at the low- binding-energy side of each peak represent the contribution of Ti3 + with the Ti3+ 2p1/2 peak at about 462.6 eV and Ti3+ 2p3/2 at 456.8 eV.14,27 Comparing with the data at acceptance angle 90◦, the spectral weight of Ti3+ is decreased at accep- tance angle 45◦(more surface sensitive), indicating interfacial charge transfer from LTO to CTO sides.

4. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance of 3CTO/3LTO.
Inset: carrier density and carrier mobility.
To verify the formation of a 2DEG at the CTO/LTO inter- faces, temperature-dependent resistance measurements were carried out.
As shown in Fig. 4, on cooling from 300 to 3 K, the sheet resistance per interface falls from 4.2 to 2.1 kΩper square.
Considering that CTO, LTO, and the NGO substrate are all insulating, and that the NGO/CTO interface is also insulating,20 the CTO/LTO interfaces are the only possible conducting channels, conﬁrming the formation of 2DEGs at the CTO/LTO interfaces.
Next, to establish the type of charge carriers and estimate the carrier density, we measured the Hall resistance in vertical external magnetic ﬁelds from −3 to 3 T. The Hall resistance is linear in applied magnetic ﬁeld, and the slope indicates the carriers in CTO/LTO are electron-like.
As seen in the inset of Fig. 4, the carrier density is almost temperature-independent at 6.5×1014 cm−2, whereas the car- rier mobility increases from 2.3 to 4.7 cm2V−1s−1 from 300 to 3 K, values ∼3 times larger than those of the previously- reported CTO/YTO superlattice.20 Based on the tight-binding calculations with the effect of TiO6 distortion,21 the conduc- tion band width of LTO (2.45 eV) is 19.6% larger than that of YTO (2.04 eV), a consequence of the larger Ti-O-Ti bond angle in LTO than in YTO.
Therefore, the higher carrier mo- bility in CTO/LTO than CTO/YTO most likely results from the larger band width of LTO.
In summary, we synthesized high quality CTO/LTO su- perlattices by PLD and characterized their crystal and elec- tronic structures with RHEED, XRD, and XPS.
Temperature- dependent electrical transport veriﬁes the formation of a 2DEG.
The carrier mobility in CTO/LTO is nearly 3 times higher than that in more-strongly-distorted CTO/YTO, result- ing from weaker octahedral distortion of TiO6 in LTO prob- ably.
Our results provide a route to design novel A-site two- dimensional polar metals.
