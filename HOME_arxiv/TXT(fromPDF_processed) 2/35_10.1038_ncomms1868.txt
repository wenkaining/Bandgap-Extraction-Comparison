EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    1  Stable magnetostructural coupling with  tunable magnetoresponsive effects in  hexagonal phase-transition ferromagnets  Enke Liu1, Wenhong Wang1, Lin Feng1, Wei Zhu1, Guijiang Li1, Jinglan Chen1,  Hongwei Zhang1, Guangheng Wu1, Chengbao Jiang2, Huibin Xu2 and Frank  de Boer3     The magnetostructural coupling between the structural and the magnetic transition  plays a crucial role in magnetoresponsive effects in a martensitic-transition system.
A combination of various magnetoresponsive effects based on this coupling may  facilitate the multifunctional applications of a host material.
Here, we demonstrate a  possibility to obtain a stable magnetostructural coupling in a broad temperature  window from 350 to 70 K, showing tunable magnetoresponsive effects, based on  simultaneous manipulation of the phase stability and the magnetic structure by  suitable chemical substitution of iron in MnNiGe.
The resultant MnNiGe:Fe exhibits a  magnetic-field-induced martensitic transition from paramagnetic austenite to  ferromagnetic martensite, featuring (i) a large volume increase, (ii) a distinct  magnetization change, (iii) small thermal hysteresis and (iv) a giant negative  magnetocaloric effect.
The results indicate that stable magnetostructural coupling is  accessible in hexagonal phase-transition systems to attain the magnetoresponsive  effects with broad tunability.

(e-mail: F.R.deBoer@uva.nl).EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    2  he ferromagnetic martensitic transition (FMMT)1-3, a coinciding crystallographic and  magnetic transition, is receiving increasing attention from both the magnetism and the  material-science community due to the massive variations of associated magnetoresponsive  effects,  such  as  magnetic-field-induced  shape  memory  (MFISM)/strain  effect4-7,  magnetoresistance8,9, Hall effect10 and magnetocaloric effect (MCE)11,12.
These effects are of  interest for many potential technological applications like magnetic actuators13,14, sensors15,  energy-harvesting devices16 and solid-state magnetic refrigeration17.
In these functionalities,  the magnetostructural coupling between the structural and the magnetic transition plays an  essential role.
Seeking a stable coupling in a broad temperature range is a scientific and  technological challenge.
In the case of ferromagnetic phase transitions coupled with martensitic-like structural  changes, it is the ferromagnetic ordering (spontaneous magnetization) that triggers modest  structural modifications due to the magnetoelastic coupling18.
This magneto-elastic transitions  have been utilized in the extensive and intensive investigations of a large body of giant  magnetocaloric materials19-27.
In contrast, in typical FMMTs, the change of structural  symmetries of austenite and martensite is remarkable.
The transformation thus converts the  different magnetic states (moment values and type of coupling) in-between the two phases  that have separate Curie (Néel) temperatures.
Since the MFISM effect based on the magnetostructural coupling has been discovered  in the Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloy7, attempts have been made to induce the structural transition of  ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FMSMAs) by applying a magnetic field.
To this end, a  TEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    3  large magnetization difference ΔM between the austenite and the martensite phase is  important to maximize the magnetic-energy change introduced by applying a magnetic field.
In a given system, if the martensitic transition is tuned to convert the magnetic states from the  paramagnetic (PM) to the ferromagnetic (FM) state, rather than from FM to FM, a large ΔM  will be found for the MFISM effect.
Such a transition is scarcely observed in the case of  ferromagnetic shape-memory alloys, including Fe-based alloys and Heusler alloys.
With this  transition, also a decrease of the magnetic entropy is associated.
Therefore, it is of interest to  find an alloy system which exhibits this particular magnetostructural transition, especially in a  broad temperature range.
For martensitic-transition systems, this PM-FM martensitic  transition requires that the Curie temperature of the martensite should be higher than that of  the austenite (see Fig. 1).
Recently, the MFISM effect has also been found in another type of materials28, the  hexagonal ternary compounds with Ni2In structure29-31.
With the FMMTs in these materials,  large MCEs are associated32-35.
Very importantly, in these compounds the magnetic-ordering  (Curie or Néel) temperatures of the martensite are higher than those of the austenite (see Fig.  1).
This large material pool provides a platform for the expected magnetostructural transition  mentioned above.
As one of the important hexagonal materials, the stoichiometric MnNiGe  compound undergoes a martensitic transition at a quite high temperature of Tt=470 K from the  hexagonal ordered Ni2In-type structure (P63/mmc, 194) to the orthorhombic TiNiSi-type  structure (Pnma, 62) (refs 36, 37 and 38; see Fig. 1).
Because this transition occurs in the PM  state, the expected magnetostructural coupling cannot be established.
Upon cooling, the  martensite phase shows a magnetic transition from the PM state to the antiferromagneticEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    4  (AFM) state at a Néel temperature (T Μ Ν ) of 346 K (ref. 36).
The magnetic moments of 2.8 μB,  which are only localized on the Mn atoms, form an AFM spiral structure36,37 so that the  magnetization is very low.
Besides, on the basis of data for near-stoichiometric MnNiGe  systems (see detailed data in Supplementary Table S1), it can be estimated that the Curie  temperature ( A C T ) of the high-temperature austenite of stoichiometric MnNiGe lies around  205 K, which is clearly below T Μ Ν  (346 K) of the low-temperature martensite.
Thus, there is  a large temperature interval of about 140 K between  A C T  and T Μ Ν .
For modifying MnNiGe into a material which has the desired PM-FM martensitic  transition, two important changes have to be introduced in the material.
In the first place, the  AFM transition in the martensite phase should be modified into a FM transition, i.e. T Μ Ν   should become  M C T .
This modification is indicated in Fig. 1 by the red dotted arrow and line.
The second necessary modification is that the martensitic-transition temperature Tt should be  lowered in a controllable fashion to a temperature within the temperature interval, as  indicated by blue dotted arrow in Fig. 1.
Achievement of these two modifications would mean  that a temperature window between  A C T  and  M C T  exists in which the magnetostructural  coupling of the martensitic transition and the PM-FM transition is established with an  appreciable value of ΔM.
For realizing materials with this desired transition, it seems promising to substitute in  MnNiGe the magnetic element Fe for the non-magnetic Ni or the magnetic Mn.
This is  promising because, in the isostructural compounds MnFeGe and FeNiGe, no martensitic  transition occurs so that the austenite structure is maintained down to 4.2 K (see detailed dataEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    5  in Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 29).
At the same time, the magnetic Fe may alter the spirally  AFM coupling of Mn moments in alloyed MnNiGe.
In this sense, alloying these  Fe-containing isostructures with MnNiGe may give rise to a more stable austenite (i.e. with  lower Tt) and a higher magnetization of martensite (i.e. FM instead of AFM martensite).
In  the present investigation, we partly substituted Fe for Ni and Fe for Mn in MnNiGe, creating  the quasi-ternary systems MnNi1-xFexGe and Mn1-xFexNiGe.
Results  Sample preparation and characterization.
The samples were prepared by arc melting and  homogenization annealing.
The structure of samples was determined with X-ray diffraction  (XRD) and no impurity phase was found.
Details of the methods are given in the Methods  section.
With increasing Fe content, the transformation temperature from orthorhombic  TiNiSi-type martensite to hexagonal Ni2In-type austenite is gradually lowered from higher  temperatures to below the room temperature (Fig. 2a).
The XRD data show that the ch (ah)  axis of the austenite phase decreases (increases) upon Fe substitution (Fig. 2b).
Temperature-dependent XRD reveals that the martensitic transition begins at 240 K in  Mn0.84Fe0.16NiGe (Fig. 2c).
An increase of 2.68% in unit-cell volume is found at the transition  (Fig. 2d; see detailed data in Supplementary Table S2).
This volume expansion is large and  opposite to the usual contraction of about -1% at martensitic structural transitions.
This  indicates that the crystalline structure and the atomic surrounding undergo a pronounced  reconstruction during the structural transition, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    6  Structural and magnetic phase diagrams.
To determine the crystallographic and magnetic  structures, low- and high-field M(T) measurements and differential thermal analysis (DTA)  were used (see detailed data in Supplementary Figs. S2, S3 and Table S3).
Based on the  experimental results, the MnNi1-xFexGe and Mn1-xFexNiGe phase diagrams are proposed as  shown in Fig. 3.
In both systems, the Fe substitution makes the martensite ferromagnetic with  a temperature of the martensitic transition that falls within the temperature range of  ferromagnetic order.
Upon substitution of Fe for Ni (MnNi1-xFexGe, see Fig. 3a), T Μ Ν  becomes  C T Μ at about  300 K. Upon further increase of Fe content, Tt continuously decreases until  A C T  is reached.
It  can also be seen that, upon substitution, both T Μ Ν  ( C T Μ) and  A C T  basically remain constant,  which offers an accessible temperature window of about 90 K between  C T Μ and  A C T .
Within  this window, the system undergoes a martensitic transition coupled with a magnetic transition  from the PM to the FM state.
Below  A C T , the magnetostructural transition decouples as the  martensitic transition rapidly vanishes.
In the case of substitution of Fe for Mn (Mn1-xFexNiGe,  see Fig. 3b), a quite low level of Fe substitution (about x = 0.08) already lowers Tt to meet  T Μ Ν  and to introduce ferromagnetism at a relatively high temperature of 350 K.
In the range  0.08 ≤ x ≤ 0.26, the FM martensite phase has a high magnetization at 5 T. The Fe substitution  efficiently converts AFM martensite into FM martensite while, surprisingly, it drives the FM  austenite parent phase into a weak-magnetic spin-glass-like state (see Fig. 4 and  Supplementary Fig. S4).
Along with the eventual vanishing of the martensitic transition at the  freezing temperature (Tg) of the spin-glass-like state, the significant consequence is obtained:  the lowest temperature of the window for the PM-FM martensitic transition with large ΔMEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    7  has moved down to about 70 K and a quite broad temperature interval up to 280 K is  generated for the stable magnetostructural coupling.
It should be pointed out that, the temperature hysteresis of the first-order martensitic  transition for both systems is significantly reduced from about 50 K to below 10 K by the Fe  substitution (see Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S3), which implies a decreasing  thermodynamic driving force for the martensite nucleation.
For a first-order martensitic  transition, the hysteresis of 10 K is very small39 which is beneficial for the temperature  sensibility of magnetoresponsive smart applications based on martensitic transitions.
Thermomagnetic behavior.
To clarify the PM-FM transitions in the broad window, we  measured the high-field thermomagnetic properties of the typical samples of Mn1-xFexNiGe  system, as shown in Fig. 4 (the thermomagnetic properties of MnNi1-xFexGe system are shown  in Supplementary Fig. S7).
In accordance with Fig. 3, Tt decreases with increasing Fe content.
For x > 0.08, PM-FM jumps of the magnetization, with large ΔM up to 60 A m2 kg-1 in a field  of 5 T, are observed.
This signifies that the introduction of Fe has led to a great change of the  magnetic exchange interaction in the martensite phase, changing the spiral AFM structure into  a FM state.
Upon cooling, for each composition the FM martensite phase nucleates and grows  in the PM austenite matrix.
Upon heating, the reversible nature of the martensitic transition  can be seen.
Here it should be emphasized again that Tt is the martensitic-transition  temperature, not the Curie temperature.
The Curie (Néel) temperatures of both phases have  the values at the respective window boundaries, which are shown in Fig. 3b.
When the  transition occurs, the austenite is still in PM state while the martensite is already in its FMEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    8  state.
It is the crystallographic structural transition between a PM phase and a FM phase that  gives rise to the abrupt magnetization change.
For x = 0.26, it can be seen that the martensitic  transition becomes incomplete and the spin-glass-like behavior revealed by the irreversible  ZFC-FC curves is in accordance with the phase diagram in Fig. 3b.
Within the broad  temperature window, a stable magnetostructural coupling is obtained from above room  temperature (350 K) to liquid-nitrogen temperature (70 K).
Magnetic-field-induced properties across the transitions.
In what follows, we study typical  magnetoresponsive properties for both systems.
Figure 5a shows the magnetization curves of  MnNi0.77Fe0.23Ge at various temperatures within the temperature window.
Above 279 K, the  austenite shows PM behavior.
Between 274 and 258 K, the continuous metamagnetic  behaviour at each temperature in high field (marked by arrows) reveals a distinct MFIMT  effect, indicating that the FM martensite phase is induced by an applied field in the PM  austenite matrix.
This behavior corresponds to an upward shift of about 11 K of the  martensitic starting transition temperature by a field of 5 T (see Supplementary Fig. S8),  which means that the martensite phase appears at a higher temperature with the aid of the  applied magnetic field.
Based on the AFM-FM conversion of the martensite upon Fe  substitution, the appreciable ΔM between the austenite and martensite introduces a larger  Zeeman energy for the martensite in an applied magnetic field, giving rise to energetically  more favourable martensite.
Similarly, a more-distinct PM-FM MFIMT effect also occurs in  Mn0.82Fe0.18NiGe, as shown in Fig. 5b.
Based on this MFIMT effect, magnetic-field-controlled  FMSMAs may be prepared in MnNiGe:Fe system.
Moreover, this MFIMT with a large  volume increase (see Fig. 2d) implies the volume of the material can be significantly changedEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    9  by an applied field.
This may benefit the magnetic-field-induced strains for potential  strain-based applications.
Associated with the sharp first-order magnetostructural transition, a magnetic-entropy  change (∆Sm) occurs40,41.
By means of the Maxwell relation, the magnetic-entropy changes at  the transitions have been derived from the magnetization curves of MnNi1-xFexGe (x = 0.23)  (Fig. 5c) and Mn1-xFexNiGe (x = 0.18) (Fig. 5d).
Because the low-temperature martensite is  FM and the high-temperature austenite is PM ( / 0 ∂ ∂ < M T ), all samples exhibit a negative  ∆Sm.
In the temperature window, MnNi0.77Fe0.23Ge exhibits a large ∆Sm value of -19 J kg-1 K-1  for ΔB = 0 - 5 T (Fig. 5c).
This window offers the possibility to obtain large ∆Sm values for  the MnNi1-xFexGe system in an interval of nearly 100 K. In the Mn1-xFexNiGe system, even  more appreciable ∆Sm values are observed in an even more extended temperature window  ranging from 350 to 70 K. As an example, a low substitution level of x = 0.18 gives rise to a  giant ∆Sm value of -31 J kg-1 K-1 for ΔB = 0 - 5 T (Fig. 5d).
These larger ∆Sm values are  attributed to the more-ferromagnetically ordered martensite and thus a lower  magnetic-entropy state after the transition.
In accordance with the MFIMT effect (see  Supplementary Fig. S8), the ∆Sm peak position also shows field dependence and shifts to  higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field (indicated by the dashed arrows in Figs.  5c and 5d).
Another feature of the MnNiGe:Fe system is that the magnetic and martensitic  transitions have the same sign of the enthalpy change (see Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3),  since the crystallographic and magnetic symmetries are both lowered on cooling.
This  prevents opposite heat processes that counteract the caloric effects, which is very different  from the common FM-AFM(PM) martensitic transitions in Fe-based and Heusler FMSMAs.
EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    10 Discussion  In this study, stable magnetostructural coupling has been realized by appropriate material  design and the associated magnetoresponsive effects have been presented.
This  magnetostructural coupling has been achieved by decreasing Tt of martensitic transition of  alloyed MnNiGe and converting the AFM to the FM state in martensite phase by replacing Ni  or Mn by Fe.
We will discuss the possible origins of both achievements in this section.
As mentioned before, the isostructural MnFeGe and FeNiGe have a stable Ni2In-type  austenite structure without martensitic transition.
This reasonably causes the decrease of the  structural transition temperature Tt (i.e., the increasingly stable austenite phase) upon  substitution of Fe in MnNiGe, which is similar to the alloying effect in many alloys42.
Inherently, this is related to the strengthening of local chemical bonds when Fe atoms are  introduced at Ni or Mn sites.
To get an insight into the change of chemical bonds, we have  calculated the valence-electron localization function (ELF) for the MnNi0.5Fe0.5Ge system (see  Supplementary Fig. S9).
The results indicate that substitution of Fe for Ni in MnNiGe leads to  stronger covalent bonding between neighbouring Fe and Ge atoms and between neighbouring  Mn and Mn atoms, which is thus largely responsible for the stabilization of the  high-temperature austenite phase.
Next, we should address the origin of the conversion of the AFM to the FM state upon  Fe substitution in the martensite.
In the martensite phase of stoichiometric MnNiGe  compound36, the zero-moment Ni atoms are surrounded by six nearest-neighbour Mn atoms,  forming a local Ni-6Mn configuration (see Fig. 6a, light blue zone; also see SupplementaryEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    11 Fig. S1).
The spiral AFM structure originates from the specific exchange interactions in the  Mn moments in this specific moment and lattice configurations in the matrix.
In high applied  magnetic fields, this spiral AFM structure changes into a canted FM structure which  eventually saturates ferromagnetically at about 10 T [ref. 36].
This behavior illustrates the  instability of the spiral AFM magnetic structure in the stoichiometric MnNiGe martensite.
According to the atomic occupancy rule in ordered Ni2In-type compounds (for more  details, see information in Supplementary Fig. S1), Fe in MnNi1-xFexGe will simply occupy  the Ni sites.
Similarly, Fe in Mn1-xFexNiGe will occupy the Mn sites.
Here we take  MnNi1-xFexGe system as an example.
Due to the unchanged relative site occupation during the  diffusionless and displacesive martensitic transition, all atoms consistently occupy their  respective sites after the transition.
In Fe-substituted martensite, whichever positions on Ni  sites the Fe atoms occupy, some Ni-6Mn local atomic configurations change into Fe-6Mn  ones.
That is, crystallographically, every introduced Fe atom is always surrounded by six  nearest-neighbour Mn atoms.
With magnetic moments of 0.5 < μ < 1 μB (ref. 43) for Fe atoms,  this Fe-6Mn local configuration internally establishes FM coupling.
The spirally  AFM-coupled Mn moments within the configuration is thus changed into parallel alignment  due to the Fe moments.
We schematically illustrate this FM Fe-centered local configuration  (pink zones) in comparison with the spiral AFM matrix in Fig. 6a.
This mechanism is similar  to the FM exchange interaction established between Mn and Co atoms by substituting Co (μ =  1 μB) for Ni in MnNiGe (ref. 44).
With increasing Fe content, the number of FM  configurations will increase and they will overlap and form larger FM zones, in this way  promoting the AFM-FM conversion in the martensite phase.
EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    12 The above described FM coupling in local Fe-6Mn configurations is explicitly  confirmed by the magnetization behaviour of MnNi1-xFexGe martensites at 5 K in fields of up  to 5 T, shown in Fig. 6b.
The Fe-free sample shows AFM behaviour with a metamagnetic  kink at a critical field Bcr of 1.3 T, indicating a metamagnetic transition from a spiral AFM to  a canted FM state, in accordance with the reported stoichiometric MnNiGe (ref. 36).
In  contrast, the Fe-substituted martensites show a large slope of the M(B) curves in low fields  that increases as a function of the Fe content.
This suggests that an increasing FM component  is generated in the system due to the existence of the Fe-centered Fe-6Mn configurations.
Meanwhile, Bcr rapidly decreases with increasing Fe content (Figs. 6b and 6d) which  corresponds to an increasing ease for the applied field to change the spiral AFM structure to a  forced parallel alignment.
The larger the number of local Fe-6Mn configurations becomes, the  lower Bcr will be.
For x = 0.30 (the highest Fe content in the martensite phase due to the  vanishing of the martensitic transition for higher substitution), a FM groundstate with a very  low Bcr of 0.05 T is found.
Due to both the Fe substitution and the applied field, the  magnetization reaches values of up to about 100 A m2 kg-1 in a field of 5 T, much higher than  that for the Fe-free sample.
By substituting Fe for Mn in MnNiGe, the AFM-FM conversion is expedited (Fig.  6c).
This is because the Fe atoms not only introduce FM coupling between Fe and Mn atoms,  but also break up the consecutive AFM sublattices of the Mn moments.
This rapidly makes  the AFM order collapse.
Thus, only a small Fe content of about x = 0.08 is sufficient to get  the maximal magnetization for Mn1-xFexNiGe (Fig. 6d).
The samples more and more easily  get magnetically saturated and show a rapidly decreasing saturation field (Figs. 6c and 6e).EKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    13 The complete FM ground state appears in the sample with x = 0.22, versus x = 0.30 in  MnNi1-xFexGe (Fig. 6c).
Therefore, we conclude that the AFM-FM conversion becomes more  efficient when the substituted Fe atoms occupy Mn sites as occurs in Mn1-xFexNiGe.
As a  consequence, this FM state in martensite phase facilitates the magnetoresponsive effects  presented in this study.
In previous studies44,45, it has been reported that the large-size Ge and zero-moment  Ni in MnNiGe can be replaced by small-size Si and magnetic Co, respectively.
Actually,  these replacements are also equal to alloying the isostructural Ni2In-type MnNiSi and  MnCoGe compound with the MnNiGe mother compound.
MnNiSi and MnCoGe undergo  martensitic transitions at high temperatures and their martensites are both ferromagnetic38.
Therefore, in martensite structure, MnNiSi and MnCoGe can reasonably change the AFM  state of alloyed MnNiGe into a FM state; however, they fail to lower the martensitic transition  temperature from 470 K of MnNiGe to below  M C T  to establish the coupling needed for the  desired magnetostructural transition.
The substitution of Fe applied in this study thus shows  the best results for both the decrease of Tt and the magnetic-state conversion of MnNiGe, that  is, for the desired PM-FM magnetostructural transition.
Very recently, an interesting paper  has been published on the pressure-tuned magnetostructural transition in Cr-doped MnCoGe  (ref. 46).
This paper clearly clarifies the importance and tunability of magnetostructural  coupling in these hexagonal ferromagnets.
To summarize, we have found that a stable PM-FM magnetostructural coupling in a  broad temperature window, with tunable magnetoresponsive properties, can be obtained inEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    14 martensitic-phase-transition materials tailored by suitable substitution of Fe in MnNiGe.
It  has been found that the MnNiGe can be manipulated in terms of crystallology and magnetism  to be easily affected by an applied magnetic field.
The Mn-based MnNiGe:Fe material has  been shown to possess compelling thermodynamic, crystallographic and magnetoresponsive  effects with broad tunability in a broad temperature range.
These effects may be utilized in  potential applications working in the range between room temperature and liquid nitrogen  temperature, such as magnetic-field-controllable martensite-particle/substrate composites3,47,  solid-state magnetic refrigeration12,24,27 or multifunctional phase-transition-strain/magnetic  sensors15 jointly driven by both large-strain structural transition and sensitive magnetic  switching from the PM to the FM state.
The presented scheme of designing materials with  appropriate magnetostructural transition may be of importance in the explore of  multifunctional  magnetoresponsive  materials  among  new  and  known  magnetic  martensitic-transition systems.
Methods  Sample preparation.
Polycrystalline ingots were prepared by arc melting high-purity metals in argon  atmosphere.
The ingots were melted four times and turned over in-between to guarantee good alloying.
The ingots were subsequently homogenized by annealing in evacuated quartz tubes under argon at  1123 K for five days and slowly cooled at 1 K min-1 to room temperature to avoid stress in samples.
Structure and thermal analysis.
The samples for powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) were made by fine  grinding.
The room-temperature powder XRD measurements were performed using a Rigaku XRD  D/max 2400 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation.
Temperature-dependent XRD measurements wereEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    15 performed from 285 to 98 K with a cooling rate of 2.5 K min-1 using a Bruker XRD D8-Advance  diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation.
At each temperature, a waiting time of 30 min was included  before starting the measurement.
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) with heating and cooling rates of  2.5 K min-1 was used to determine the martensitic-transition characteristic temperatures (defined as the  peak values of the dM/dT and DTA curves).
Magnetic measurements.
Magnetization measurements were carried out on powder samples using a  superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, Quantum Design MPMS XL-7).
Low field M(T) measuments on high-temperature PM austenite and low-temperature martensite were performed to  study the temperature-dependent magnetic behaviour and also to determine the martensitic-transition  characteristic  temperatures.
These  experiments  were  combined  with  DTA.
ZFC-FC  thermalmagnetization in a field of 0.01 T and frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility were  measured with frequencies f = 1, 97, 496, 997 and 1488 Hz in an AC magnetic field of 4 Oe after ZFC  from 300 K.
In order to accurately derive the magnetic-entropy changes (∆Sm) at magnetostructural  transitions with thermal hysteresis, the so-called loop process method48 was adopted to get the  isothermal magnetization curves.
The isothermal M(B) curves were measured in fields of up to 5 T  upon cooling with a temperature interval of 2 K. Before each isothermal magnetization, the samples  were all the way heated up to the complete PM austenite region (100 K away from the  magnetostructural transitions) with heating rate of 5 K min-1 to eliminate the history-dependent  magnetic states and then cooled back to the targeted measurement temperature points.
All these  temperature loops were performed in zero field.
To avoid the overmuch temperature-induced FM  martensite phase during approaching each targeted temperature point, the temperature scanning modeEKLiu, et al, IOP, CAS, China    16 was set as NO OVERSHOOT with cooling rate of 2 K min-1.
Besides, a waiting time of 300 s was  compelled before the measurements to guarantee a highly stable temperature.
The ∆Sm was then  derived from the resulting magnetization curves using the Maxwell relation49:   m m m 0 H ( , ) ( , ) ( ,0) H M S T H S T H S T dH T ∂   ∆ = − =   ∂   ∫ . ELF calculations.
The ELF calculations using the pseudopotential method with plane-wave-basis set  based on density-functional theory were presented in Supplementary Methods. References    1.

The gray solid lines display the magnetization of the ferromagnetic  Ni2In-type austenite with Curie temperature ( A C T )and the magnetization of the antiferromagnetic  TiNiSi-type martensite with Néel temperature ( M N T ).
At Tt = 470 K, the hexagonal Ni2In-type to  orthorhombic TiNiSi-type martensitic transition occurs in stoichiometric MnNiGe, indicated by the blue  solid arrow.
The red dashed arrow indicates the expected AFM-to-FM conversion and the blue dashed  arrow the expected decrease of Tt.
Within the expected temperature window between  A C T  and  M C T , the  martensitic transition would couple with a magnetic transition from the PM to the FM state.

In the range  0 ≤ x ≤ 0.30 for MnNi1-xFexGe (a) and 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.26 for Mn1-xFexNiGe (b), the systems undergo a Ni2In-type  to TiNiSi-type martensitic transition at Tt.

The unit cell axes and volumes of the  two structures are related as ao=ch, bo=ah, co=√3ah and Vo=2Vh (ref. 3). Isostructures.
As Ni2In-type ternary compounds1,4, MnNiGe, MnFeGe and FeNiGe  are all isostructural ordered intermetallics.
The neutron diffraction experiments have  determined that their space group number is 194 and the atomic occupancy sites are  as follows (see inset of Figure S1a): Mn: 2a sites, Ni: 2d sites, Ge: 2c sites in MnNiGe;   Mn: 2a sites, Fe: 2d sites, Ge: 2c sites in MnFeGe;   Fe: 2a sites, Ni: 2d sites, Ge: 2c sites in FeNiGe.
This atomic occupancy rule is dominated by covalent electron numbers3.
In a  given Ni2In-type system, the element with more covalent electrons preferentially  occupies 2a sites, while the element with less covalent electrons preferentially  occupies 2d sites.
The p-block elements always occupy 2c sites.
That is, the Ni atoms  in Ni2In-type MnNiGe and Fe atoms in isostructural MnFeGe both occupy the same 2d  sites.
Therefore, in MnNi1-xFexGe the Fe will simply occupy the Ni (2d) sites.
Similarly,SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      4  alloying isostructural FeNiGe with MnNiGe (Mn1-xFexNiGe), the Fe will simply occupy  the Mn (2a) sublattices.
Ni-6Mn and Fe-6Mn local configurations.
In TiNiSi-type martensite phase of  stoichiometric MnNiGe (refs 1, 2), each zero-moment Ni atom is surrounded by six  nearest-neighbour Mn atoms, forming a Ni-6Mn local atomic configuration (see Figure  S1b, indicated by green dashed lines).
After some Ni atoms are replaced by Fe atoms,  the Fe atoms are surrounded by six nearest-neighbour Mn atoms.
That is, the Fe-6Mn  local atomic configurations are formed in the same positions.

a, Fe- content dependence of the critical temperature of the AFM-FM transition (marked by  vertical arrows), measured in a field of 5 T. With increasing Fe content, the FM state is  stable down to lower temperatures.
b, Magnetic-field dependence of the critical  temperature of the AFM-FM transition (marked by vertical arrows) for a typical sample  with x = 0.20.
With increasing field, the FM state is stable down to low temperatures.
Based on these data, a yellow-star line corresponding to the critical temperature  ( 5T cr T ) between FM and AFM states in a field of 5 T was indicated in phase diagram in  Figure 3a in the main article.
Upon cooling, the system in the range of 0.08 < x < 0.23  returns back to an AFM state although a high field of 5 T is applied.
This is due to the  strong intrinsic AFM interactions in MnNiGe parent compound.
Nevertheless, this AFM  interaction has been effectively overcome by alloying FeNiGe into MnNiGe, as shown  in Figure 3b in the main article.
a  bSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      10      Supplementary Figure S7:    Magnetostructural coupling in the temperature window of MnNi1-xFexGe system.
The magnetization curves were measured in a high field of 5 T. Tt indicates the  martensitic-transition temperature.
The gray curve is of the spiral AFM martensite of  Fe-free stoichiometric MnNiGe.
The  M N T  in high field is at 350 K and the Tt is at 460 K.
In accordance with the phase diagram, the martensitic transition temperature Tt  decreases with increasing Fe content.
For the samples with x = 0.15 and 0.20, the  martensitic transition temperature Tts are just above the  M C T  of martensites (see the  phase diagram in main article), thus the martensitic and magnetic transitions are not  completely coupled.
For the sample with x = 0.30, the  A C T  of austenite appears at  about 225 K in the high field.
Thus the martensitic transition occurs from FM austenite  to FM martensite with a relatively small ΔM.
Inside the temperature window between  Tt  Tt Tt Tt  TtSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      11  M C T  and  A C T , a sudden PM-FM jump of the magnetization based on the hysteretic  martensitic transition is expectedly observed, which indicates that the introduction of  Fe has led to a marked change of the magnetic interactions in the martensite and the  AFM state of the martensite has thus been changed into a FM state.

The scale bar from blue to red corresponds to increasing electron  localization.
The increasing stability of austenite phase may be greatly related to the  strengthening of local chemical bonds when Fe atoms were introduced onto the Ni  sites in MnNiGe.
The valence-electron localization function (ELF)5, as an indicator of  the electron-pair distribution in terms of inter-atomic bonding, can provide the  topological analysis of chemical bonds (see Supplementary Methods).
Thus the ELF  of MnNi0.5Fe0.5Ge has been calculated to probe the stability of austenite phase, as  Ge2  Mn1  Mn2  Mn3  Ni  a  b  c  Fe  Ni  Fe  Ge1SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      14  presented in Fig. S9.
In this highly-ordered substituted structure, an alternating  sequence of Fe-Ge and Ni-Ge layers is formed, as seen in Figs. S9a and S9b, which  provides a convenient comparison between Fe-Ge and Ni-Ge bonding.
From the  topological analysis of ELF, it can be seen that the electron localization between  nearest-neighbor Fe and Ge atoms (Ge1 in the Ni-Ge layers and Ge2 in the Fe-Ge  layers) is strengthened with respect to that between nearest-neighbor Ni and Ge  atoms.
Furthermore, Fe-substitution leads to a considerable reduction of the interlayer  spacing of (nearest-neighbor) Mn2 and Mn3 atoms, which is in agreement with the  reduction of ch axis in XRD results (see Figure 2b in the main article).
Thus, increased  electron localization between the Mn atoms in interlayers is seen.
These results  indicate that alloying MnFeGe with MnNiGe leads to stronger covalence bonding  between neighbor Fe and Ge atoms and between neighbor Mn and Mn atoms and  therefore to an stabilization of the austenite phase.
This stabilization is responsible for  the decrease of the Tt of the martensitic transition.
Besides, the ELF calculations for  alloying FeNiGe into MnNiGe give similar results.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      15  Supplementary Methods  ELF calculations.
Ab initio calculations were carried out using the pseudopotential  method with plane-wave-basis set based on density-functional theory6.
The electronic  exchange correlation energy was treated under the local spin density approximation  (LSDA)7.
The Ge potential with electronic configuration of 3d10 4s2 4p2 was chosen,  which also treats the Ge 3d outer-core electrons as valence electrons for higher  accuracy.
Plane-wave cut-off energy of 770 eV and 126 (13×13×12) k points in the  irreducible Brillouin zone were used for a good convergence of the total energy.
The  absolute total-energy difference tolerance for the self-consistent field cycle was set at  5×10-7 eV/atom.
The geometry optimizations for the atomic site occupancy in the cell  were performed on the experimental lattice parameters using the Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) minimization scheme8.
The ELF5 is introduced to represent  the conditional probability of finding a second like-spin electron near the reference  position.
It is a local, relative measure of the Pauli repulsion effect on the kinetic  energy density.
Higher ELF values at the reference position show that the electrons  are more localized than in a uniform electron gas of identical density.
The topological  analysis of ELF represents the organization of chemical bonds and, more particularly,  the bond types.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION      16    Supplementary Table S1:   Curie temperature (TC A) of austenite in some near-stoichiometric MnNiGe systems  from the references.
The TC A of stoichiometric MnNiGe is estimated at 205 K  according to near-stoichiometric systems, which is below the Néel temperature of  martensite (TN M) at 346 K. Thus, there is a large temperature interval of about 140 K  between TC A and TN M.
