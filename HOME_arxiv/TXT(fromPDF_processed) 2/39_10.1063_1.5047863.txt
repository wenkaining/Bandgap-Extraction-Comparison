arXiv:1807.00350v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  8 Jul 2018 Assessing the performance of the recent non-empirical semilocal density functionals on describing the lattice constants, bulk moduli and cohesive energies of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals Subrata Jana,1, ∗Kedar Sharma,2 and Prasanjit Samal1 1School of Physical Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research, HBNI, Bhubaneswar 752050, India 2School of Physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Maruthamala, Vithura, Thiruvananthapuram 695551, India (Dated: July 10, 2018) The bulk properties (lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies) of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals are studied within the framework of the recently developed meta-GGA (meta- Generalized Gradient Approximation) semilocal exchange-correlation functionals.
To establish the applicability, broadness and accuracy of meta-GGA functionals we also put the results of PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) and PBEsol (PBE reparametrized for solids) functionals.
The interesting feature of the present paper is that it measures the accuracy of the recently developed TM (Tao- Mo) and TMTPSS (TM exchange with Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) correlation) and SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed) functionals on describing aforementioned properties.
The present systematic investigation shows that the TM is accurate in describing the lattice constants while for cohesive energies and bulk moduli the accuracy is biased towards the PBE and TPSS functionals.
I. INTRODUCTION Since its advent, the Kohn-Sham (KS)1 density func- tional theory (DFT) is a de facto standard theoreti- cal framework for studying the electronic structures of solids and materials.
The accuracy of the KS density functional depends on the accuracy of the approximate exchange-correlation functionals.
Due to the reason- able computational cost with comparatively well bal- anced accuracy the semilocal nature of the exchange- correlation functionals i.e., the local density approx- imations (LDA)2, generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)3–16 and meta-generalized gradient approxima- tion (meta-GGA)17–24,26,27 are widely used for the bulk properties of solids28–39,42.
The mainstream of semilo- cal density functionals are developed based on the con- straint satisfaction8–16,20–24,26,27 or modelling the ex- change hole27 or association both the properties 27.
Usu- ally, benchmarking the density functional approxima- tions against the experimental features are common prac- tice to measure the accuracy and applicability of the ap- proximation, in particular when a new functional is in- troduced.
Indeed, the systematic evaluation of the prop- erties of a density functional approximation guide users to properly choose a functional for describing the mate- rial properties.
Also, the behavior of the functionals for the wide range of systems makes it easier to improve the drawback of the functional.
The present paper seeks to assess the performance of the recently proposed meta-GGA functionals at the accu- racy of the bulk properties of the transition metals.
More speciﬁcally, we consider the lattice constants (or equilib- rium shortest distances), bulk moduli, and cohesive en- ergies of transition metals.
Regarding the performance of diﬀerent level of density functional approximations for the bulk properties of transition metals, it has been stud- ied earlier within the framework of GGA, meta-GGA and hybrid functionals theory.
In ref.34 Janthon et.
al. stud- ied the transition metals within the framework of GGA based functionals.
In ref.35 Janthon et. al.
further ex- plore the behavior of transition metals by including meta- GGA level functionals.
Besides, Hass et. al.36, Csonka et. al.38, Tran et. al.37, Schimka et. al.39, Hao et. al.40, and Zhang et.
al.41 partially cover the lattice constants, co- hesive energies and bulk moduli of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
In this paper, we put together the lattice constants, cohesive energies and bulk mod- uli of all the alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition met- als within the framework of recently developed meta- GGA functionals.
Our comparison meta-GGA function- als contain Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS)20, revised TPSS (revTPSS)21, Minnesota 2006 local func- tional (M06L)19, meta-GGA made simple (MS0, MS1, and MS2)23–25 functionals, Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN)26, and Tao-Mo27 meta- GGA functional (TMTPSS and TM) functionals.
Arguably, the recent advances in the meta-GGA func- tionals show that the accuracy of the functionals can be further improved by imposing more exact constraints on the functional construction.
The motivation of the present paper ﬂows from the appealing features and ac- curacy of the recently developed meta-GGA functionals.
The recent development of the meta-GGA functionals shows that the SCAN functionals developed by Sun et.
al.26 and TM functional developed by Tao et.
al.27 quite accurate in describing several bulk properties of solids.
Though the SCAN functional has been studied for bulk properties of few metals but remains untested exten- sively for the alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition met- als.
Also, the recently developed TM functional remains untested for those properties.
In the present paper, we present the benchmark calculations of the bulk properties of the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali, and alka-2 line earth metals.
In particular, due to diﬀerent bonding nature of the alkali, alkaline-earth and transition metals, they are considered as the diﬃcult cases within semilo- cal exchange-correlation functionals.
Though they are considered mainly as metals and metallic bonding domi- nates, but the weak van-der-Waals interactions in closed semi-core states also play important role39,49.
These make the semilocal functionals diﬃcult to describe ac- curately all the bonding nature and often in the bench- marking calculations the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali and alkaline earth metals are excluded.
It was shown in ref.39 that the PBE functional does not perform in a satisfactory way in describing the lat- tice constants of all these metals.
It was shown that the PBE lattice constants for 3d metals are slightly too small, whereas, the lattice constants reported for 4d and 5d metals using PBE are too large.
It was also shown in ref.39 that the situation improves through the in- clusion of kinetic-energy density term in the functional construction.
Due to the one electron free correlation of the revTPSS functional, it performs reasonably for the transition metal lattice constants.
All these previ- ous studies motivate us to assess the accuracy of the recently developed meta-GGAs in predicting the afore- mentioned bulk properties.
It is noteworthy to men- tion that the SCAN functional includes the intermedi- ate van-der-Waals (vdW) interaction, therefore it will be an interesting study to assess its performance for alkali and alkaline-earth materials, where the bonding is inﬂu- enced by the vdW interaction in the semi-core states.
Regarding the TM functionals, it was shown that both the TM and TPSS correlation perform diﬀerently with the TM exchange.
But the accuracy of the TMTPSS and TM has not been measured against the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali, and alkaline earth metals.
In this paper, we put all the modern meta-GGA density functionals (TPSS, revTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS, and TM) together with GGA (PBE8 and PBEsol12) based semilocal functionals to assess the performance of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition met- als.
This paper is organized as follows: In the following, we will describe our computational set up along with the test set used for our calculations.
Following that, we will study the lattice constants, bulk moduli and surface energies of the transition metals.
We will conclude by discussing and comparing our results. II.
COMPUTATIONAL SETUP All computational studies are performed using the plane wave code based on the projector-augmented method Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)43–48.
The Bulk calculations are performed with 16 × 16 × 16 Gamma-centered k−points.
Re- garding the atomic calculations of cohesive energies a simulation box of 20 × 20 × 20 ˚A3 has been used with 1 × 1 × 1 Gamma-centered k−points.
The spin polarization calculations are performed for atoms.
An energy convergence criterion of 10−6 has been set for bulk calculations, whereas, the atomic simulations are performed with energy convergence criterion of 10−5.
It is noteworthy to mention that all calculations of the meta-GGA functionals are performed by starting from the PBE wavefunctions and change densities.
The energy cutoﬀ500 eV to 700 eV is used for bulk calculations, whereas 700 eV to 1000 eV energy cutoﬀis used for the atomic calculations.
The results present in TABLEs are arranged by sepa- ration out the 3d transition metals, 4d transition metals, 5d transition metals, alkali metals (K, Rb, and Cs) and alkaline-earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba).
Under the ambi- ent condition, all the alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, and transition metals show fcc, bcc, or hcp structures.
Only exceptions are Mn, La, and Hg.
These materials show complicated hexagonal (La), rhombohedral (Hg) and cubic unit cell with 58 atoms (Mn).
Due to the very diﬀerent structures of La, Hg, and Mn, they are also discussed separately in all TABLEs.
To compare the overall accuracy of all the functionals we present mean-error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE) of the 3d, 4d, 5d along with alkali and alkaline metals.
The total ME and total MAE is also given in the last column of each TABLE. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A. Equilibrium Inter-atomic Shortest Distances All the lattice constants of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals are determined at their ambient condi- tions and non-magnetic phases.
The experimental values presented in TABLE I are subtracted for the zero-point vibrational eﬀects (ZPVE).
TABLE I presents the ZPVE corrected equilibrium inter-atomic distances along with the benchmark results of all the functionals.
The equi- librium inter-atomic distances depend on the equilibrium lattice constants according to the diﬀerent lattice struc- tures.
For the details of the relation between the inter- atomic distances and equilibrium lattice constants, the readers are suggested to go through the ref.34. In FIG.
I, we also show the percentage deviation of our calculated values.
Though the calculations for the PBE, PBEsol, M06L, TPSS, and revTPSS are reported in past for sev- eral solids, but in our present study, we recalculate all the solids along with recently developed meta-GGAs.
In this section, we will discuss the functional performances according to the data present in TABLE I.3 TABLE I: Equilibrium shortest distances δ (in Picometre (pm)) of diﬀer- ent solid structures using PBE, PBEsol, TPSS, revTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals.
The experimental ref- erence values are collected from references35,38,39, where the correction due to the zero-point vibrational eﬀects (ZPVE) are taken into account.
For elements Mn, La and Hg the ZPVE corrected values are not available and we reported only the experimental values taken from reference34.

The 3d elements contain with Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn.
Let us start our discussion with the popularly used GGA functional PBE.
The PBE functional perform fairly good throughout the series.
However, It overesti- mates the inter-atomic distances of Sc, Ti, V, and Cu, and underestimations the inter-atomic distances for Cr, Fe, and Co.
But it gives a fairly good inter-atomic dis- tance for Ni.
Regarding the performance of the PBEsol, it underestimates the inter-atomic distances of all the elements except Sc and Ti.
For Sc, the PBEsol over- estimates the inter-atomic distance, whereas, very good inter-atomic distance is obtained for Ti.
The underesti- mation percentage of all the elements are fairly large for PBEsol compared to PBE.
Especially, for Fe, a fairly large underestimation is observed.
Now, we consider the meta-GGA functionals.
Regarding the performance for the TPSS and revTPSS functionals, the revTPSS functional lower the inter-atomic distances compared to TPSS for all the 3d elements by almost 1 pm to 3 pm.
TPSS overestimates the inter-atomic distances for Sc, Ti, but it follows the diﬀerent trend as the d bands become ﬁlled.
For V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn TPSS underes- timates the inter-atomic distances.
The underestimation tendency becomes less intense as the d band almost ﬁlled.
Now, concerning the performance of M06L, it follows the same trend as TPSS does except for Ni and Cu.
For Ni and Cu, M06L underestimates the inter-atomic distances more than TPSS and revTPSS do.
Now, for the meta- GGA made simple functionals (MS0, MS1, and MS2), all perform equivalently and overestimate the inter-atomic distances for Sc and Ti, but underestimate the inter- atomic distances form V to Zn.
The underestimation and overestimation percentage of all the “MS” function- als are fairly large compared to the traditional TPSS and revTPSS functionals.
Now, we consider the performance of the two recently proposed functionals SCAN and TM (TMTPSS and TM).
The performance of SCAN quite disappointing as it follows the same trend of “MS” func- tionals.
The MAE of SCAN functional indicates that it performs better than MS0 but less accurate than MS1 and MS2.
Now, concerning TMTPSS and TM function- als both are less accurate than TPSS in predicting the inter-atomic distances of 3d metals.
In fact, both show the same tradition as it is observed using other meta- GGAs.
Overall consideration shows that the PBE func- tionals perform fairly well for all the 3d elements and reports the best MAE compared to the more advanced meta-GGA functionals.
Overall tendency of meta-GGAs shows that TPSS is the best among all the meta-GGA functionals.
We do not observe improvement in the inter- atomic distances using the more advance functionals like SCAN and TM based functionals.
4d transition metals : Unlike the 3d elements, in this case, the PBE functional overestimates the the inter- atomic distances of all the elements except Mo.
A sizable overestimation in the inter-atomic distances is observed for Y, Zr, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag and Cd.
For Nb, the over- estimation is observed within the limit of ≈2 pm.
The PBEsol functional reduce the sizable overestimation per- centage of PBE.
Concerning the meta-GGAs function- als, very good MAE is observed using revTPSS, MS1, MS2, SCAN and TM functionals.
A sizable overestima- tion in the interatomic distances is observed using the TPSS, M06L and MS0 functionals.
Among all the meta- GGAs, the error obtained using the M06L functional is fairly large.
It actually follows PBE like tendency in this case.
Regarding the recent two meta-GGAs, SCAN and TM, both perform equivalently for all the elements ex- cept Y. In that case, the SCAN overestimates more than TM functionals.
For 4d transition metals, the TM func- tional performs better than TMTPSS functionals.
For 4d transition metal elements, all semilocal functionals show overestimation tendency in predicting the inter-atomic distances except for few cases.
5d transition metals : We observe the same trend as it is observed for the 4d elements.
A fairly sizable overestimation is observed for PBE functional.
PBEsol reduces the MAE for the PBE functional.
In case of meta-GGA functionals, the revTPSS, SCAN, and TM functionals perform equivalently.
Using the “MS” meta- GGAs we obtain almost equivalent MAE.
Interestingly, the “MS” meta-GGA functionals overall overestimate the interatomic distances for few cases, whereas, underesti- mation in the inter-atomic distances are observed for oth- ers.
A similar tendency is observed for the SACN func- tional.
Both the TM and TMTPSS functionals quite reasonably predict the inter-atomic distances for the Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au.
For other elements overestima- tion is observed.
Overall we obtain least MAE using the revTPSS and TM functionals.
Alkali metals : The alkali metals contain elements K, Rb and Cs.
We separately discuss these metals be- cause diﬀerent kinds of interactions aﬀect the bonding of these metals.
Though they are considered as prototypi- cal metals but a contribution from the semi-core p and s states originate van-der-Waals bonding39,49 which aﬀect the lattice constants or equilibrium shortest distances.
A sizable error in equilibrium shortest distances is observed5 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) FIG. 1.
Histograms of relative error in the interatomic shortest distances.
The percentage deviation is plotted along Y-axis.
The numbering of the ﬁgures are as the order of the solids presented in TABLE I. from the PBE functionals.
The PBE functionals overes- timate the equilibrium shortest distances for all the al- kali metals.
The PBEsol improves the performance and yields the least MAE for the alkali metals.
Regarding the performance of the meta-GGAs, all functionals over- estimate the equilibrium shortest distances except the M06L, TMTPSS and TM functionals.
The M06L mas- sively underestimates the equilibrium shortest distances of alkali metals, whereas, TMTPSS and TM agree very well with the experimental values.
Both TMTPSS and TM functionals produce much better results than SCAN meta-GGA functional, though the SCAN contains inter- mediate van-der-Waals interactions.
Alkaline-earth metals : Unlike alkali metals, a rea- sonably good performance is observed using the PBE functionals for the alkaline-earth metals.
However, the PBEsol underestimates the equilibrium shortest dis- tances.
Within meta-GGA functionals, TPSS and MS2 perform quite well.
A sizable underestimation in the equilibrium shortest distances is observed using the M06L functional.
MS0 and MS1 overestimate the equi- librium shortest distances, whereas, the overestimation percentage comparatively inadequate for the SCAN func- tional.
In this case, both the TMTPSS and TM func- tionals underestimate the equilibrium shortest distances.
But, the TMTPSS quite close to the experimental equi- librium shortest distances.
In this case, the SCAN func- tional agrees well with the experimental values than TMTPSS and TM functionals.
Other transition metals : Due to the complicated structure of the Mn, La, and Hg, we separate out these el- ements from others.
Regarding the performance of PBE, it massively overestimates the equilibrium shortest dis- tances for all these metals.
Reasonably good performance is observed using PBEsol.
For meta-GGAs, all perform equivalently to predict the equilibrium shortest distances except M06L. M06L overestimates the shortest distances in a sizable order.
The TPSS, MS0, MS1 perform equiv- alently.
We obtain MAE 4.250 pm from the revTPSS functionals.
The MS2 and SCAN also produce the same amount of error in this case.
Here, we obtain least MAE with the MS0 and MS1 functionals.
TM functional is the second best after MS0 and MS1 with MAE 2.7 pm.
In this case also the performance TM functional is better to6 compare to the SCAN functional.
Overall performance : Correspond to the overall ranking we obtain the best MAE with the TM functional.
Next, the performance of the TMTPSS is found to be best.
The performance of TM and TMTPSS is quite well compared to the SCAN functional.
The revTPSS, MS2 and SCAN functionals perform equivalently.
The MAE of TPSS is less compare to the MS0 and MS1.
The M06L gives the largest MAE of order 8.1 pm.
B. Bulk Moduli The bulk modulus (B0) is deﬁned as the variation of the volume (V ) due to the external pressure (P).
In DFT the bulk modulus is measured at the equilibrium lattice constant a0 or volume (V0) as, TABLE II: Bulk moduli (B0) (in GPa) calculated using diﬀerent solid structures using PBE, PBEsol, TPSS, revTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals.

(1) Several equations of state (EOS)50–53 are available to ﬁt the energy versus volume curve to obtain the bulk moduli.
However, in the present case, we use the Birch- Murnaghan equation of state to ﬁt and obtain the bulk moduli of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
It is well known that determining the bulk modulus posses a great challenge, in particular for the transition metals35.
The experimental values along with all the functionals values are presented in TABLE II.
The general trend of the arrangement of TABLE II is the same as it is done in the case of the equilibrium shortest distances.
The 3d, 4d and 5d band elements are separated out.
The values of alkali metals and alkali earth metals are also shown sep- arately.
The Mn, La, and Hg values are also separated out.
In Fig. (2) we also plot the percentage deviation of all the metals considered in our work.
The Fig. (2) is also arranged according to the data presented in TABLE II.
3d transition metals : The PBE functional works well for the 3d transition metals and produces the least MAE.
PBE functional overestimates the bulk moduli for few cases, whereas, underestimates in results are ob- served for others.
However, the performance of the re- vised version of PBE i.e., PBEsol deviates more from the experimental values and yield MAE 44.178 GPa.
Re- garding the meta-GGAs, all functionals deviate from the experimental values more or less.
However, MS1 reports being least MAE among the meta-GGA functionals.
We obtain equivalent performance using the TPSS, revTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals.
4d transition metals : For the 4d transition metals the TPSS functional performs best with MAE 8.0 GPa.
The PBE functional underestimates the bulk moduli of all the elements except Nb, Mo Tc, Ru.
For those metals, the PBE values are very close to the experimental one.
Unlike PBE, the PBEsol overestimates the bulk moduli of all the 4d metals and provides the MAE 13.4 GPa.
The performance of revTPSS, MS0, MS1, MS2 are al- most equivalent.
All functionals overestimate the bulk moduli except few cases.
The “MS” functionals yield reasonably good bulk moduli for Y, Zr, Pd, Ag, and Cd.
We ﬁnd reasonably good performance for Y, Zr, and Ag using revTPSS functional.
For others overestimation is observed.
The bulk moduli obtained from SCAN func- tional matches well with the experimental values except for few cases like Mo, Tc, and Ru.
For Mo, Tc, and Ru the SCAN functional overestimates the value.
From the TMTPSS and TM functionals, we obtain the similar trend as it is observed for SCAN.
In this case, the TM functional overestimates more than TMTPSS in predict- ing the bulk moduli of 4d metals.
5d transition metals : For the 5d transition metals the performance of revTPSS, TPSS, and PBE are found to be better compared to the others.
The M06L under- estimates the bulk moduli for all, except Hf, Ta, and Re.
The overall ME obtain from the M06L is found to be negative.
The MS0, MS1, MS2, and SCAN functionals perform equivalently and provide almost equivalent ME and MAE.
The performance of TM functional indicates that it yields slightly greater values for bulk moduli com- pared to the TMTPSS functional.
Comparing the per- formance of SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals, both the TMTPSS and TM show improve performance than SCAN functional.
Alkali metals : The alkali matters are considered as a “soft-matter” due to the smaller extent of their bulk8 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) FIG. 2.
Histograms of relative error in bulk moduli (in %) are presented.
The numbering of the ﬁgures are as the order of the solids presented in TABLE II. moduli.
The bulk moduli of alkali metals vary only from 2.1 GPa (Cs) to 3.7 GPa (K).
All the functionals perform reasonably good in case of all the alkali metals.
The largest MAE is obtained from M06L functional, whereas, all other meta-GGA and GGAs varies from 0.1 GPa to 0.5 GPa.
Alkaline-earth metals : Like the alkali metals, we obtain equivalent performance of all the functionals for alkaline-earth metals.
In this case, the largest MAE is ob- tained from M06L.
The performance of revTPSS, MS0, MS1, MS2, and SCAN are almost equivalent.
The TPSS functional yields the MAE 0.4 GPa.
In this case, we obtain the least MAE from the TMTPSS and TM func- tional.
Both functionals perform fairly well than SCAN functional.
Other transition metals : The bulk moduli of Mn, La, and Hg are problematic within (most of) the den- sity functionals.
The experimental bulk modulus of Mn is 90.4 GaP, whereas, all the functionals show sizable overestimation.
The bulk modulus of La using all the functionals are predicted to be fairly well, but overesti- mation and underestimation in values are observed for Hg using all the functionals.
The bulk modulus of Hg obtained from TPSS, revTPSS, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN and TMTPSS show good agreement with the experimen- tal values.
The M06L underestimates the bulk modulus of Hg and the same amount of overestimation is observed for the TM functional.
Overall performances : To evaluate the overall per- formance of all the functionals we present the ME and MAE with and without considering Mn, La and Hg tran- sition metals.
Overall, the PBE functional yields the best MAE (14.5 GPa with other transition metals and 12.3 without other transition metals).
All meta-GGAs over- all overestimate the ME and MAE.
The performance of TPSS functional seems to be the best within all the meta- GGAs.
C. Cohesive Energies The Cohesive energies are equivalent to the atomiza- tion energies in the case of the bulk solids.
It is expressed as the energy per atom as,9 TABLE III: Fixed lattice constant cohesive energies (in eV/atom) of dif- ferent solid structures using PBE, PBEsol, TPSS, revTPSS, M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2, SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals.
All the ﬁnite tem- perature corrected experimental values are collected from references35,39.

Predicting the cohe- sive energies of transition metals posses great challenge because of their “strongly” correlated nature39.
TABLE III presents the performance of all the functionals along with the experimental values.
We arrange TABLE III in the same manner as it is done in the case of lattice constants and bulk moduli.
The behavior of all the func- tionals are also plotted in the Fig. 3.
The percentage deviation of all the functionals is shown there.
All the cohesive energies are calculated at the equilibrium lattice constants of the functional.
3d transition metals : The PBE functional predicts the cohesive energies of 3d transition metals quite well compared to the other GGA and meta-GGA based func- tionals.
Though PBE overestimates the cohesive ener- gies for Sc, Ti, Fe, and Co, but overall both the ME and MAE are found to be reasonably well predicted within PBE functional.
The PBEsol overestimates the cohesive energies of 3d transition metals more.
Therefore, increase in ME and MAE is observed with the PBEsol functional.
Within the meta-GGA functionals, the performance of MS1 is the best.
MS0 quite closely follows the MS1 func- tional.
Comparing the SCAN, TMTPSS and TM func- tionals, the SCAN functional performs better compared to TM based functionals.
The revTPSS overestimates the TPSS values more and yield more enhanced ME and MAE.
The M06L yield the same MAE as it is obtained from MS2.
A noticeable observation is that revTPSS behaves closely as PBEsol.
This can be understood from the explanation given in ref.39.
In metals, as the d band started ﬁlling, the meta-GGA total charge density be- comes the sum of several one-electron orbitals39.
There- fore, revTPSS becomes PBEsol like.
But, the improved functionals like SCAN behaves more closely to PBE for Sc, Ti.
But the SCAN functional reasonably underesti- mates the cohesive energies of V, and Cr, and overesti- mates for Fe to Zn.
A diﬀerent tendency is observed for TMTPSS and TM functionals.
Both overestimates the cohesive energies noticeably.
4d transition metals : Unlike previous observation, the PBE functional underestimates the cohesive energies of 4d transition metals.
The PBEsol overestimates the cohesive energies of all metals except Nb.
In this case, the TPSS predicts the best ME and MAE.
The TPSS functional predicts reasonably good cohesive energies for Y, Zr, Tc, and Pd.
For others, it underestimates or overestimates the values.
In this case, also we observe that the revTPSS follows closely that of the PBEsol re- sults.
The M06L functional overall overestimates the co- hesive energies except for few cases.
The MS0, MS1 and MS2 functionals perform almost equivalently.
The SCAN functional are also closely following the “MS” functionals.
We observe that the TMTPSS and TM functionals show PBEsol like tendency.
Here, the TM functional overesti- mates the cohesive energies more which are produced by TMTPSS.
5d transition metals : For 5d transition metals also, the PBE performs quite reasonably.
PBE overestimates the cohesive energies for Ta, and Ir but performs well for Hf, W, Re, Os, Pt, and Au.
The PBEsol shows the same tendency as it is obtained in the cases of 3d and 4d elements.
The TPSS functional enhances the PBE results, therefore, the increase in the MAE is observed compared to the PBE results.
Here, the revTPSS also follows closely the PBEsol results.
The M06L functionals overestimate the half d ﬁll transition metals but perform well for largely ﬁlled d transition metals.
In this case also the “MS” functionals perform equivalently, though the results of MS2 are found to be more enhanced than MS0 and MS1.
In this case, the SCAN functional performs quite well compared to the TMTPSS and TM function- als.
Both the TMTPSS and TM functional overestimate the results of all the 5d metals, but the overestimation tendency is lesser than the SCAN functional.
Alkali metals : The alkali metals are often included in the benchmarking calculations for the diﬀerent func- tionals for the semiconductor in predicting the cohesive energies.
All the GGAs and meta-GGAs (except M06L) perform quite reasonably for the cohesive energies of al- kali metals.
The PBEsol and revTPSS show the best performance with MAE 0.02 eV/atom.
In this case, the “MS” functionals and SCAN perform equivalently.
The TMTPSS and TM also predict the cohesive energies which are quite close to the experimental results.
Alkaline-earth metals : For alkaline-earth metals, PBE and TPSS perform quite remarkably.
The PBE and TPSS show opposite tendency.
PBE shows a small degree of underestimation (except Ca), whereas, TPSS shows a small degree of overestimation.
The same behav- ior is observed for the case of PBEsol and revTPSS.
In this case, also the “MS” functionals and SCAN perform equivalently.
We observe a noticeable amount of overes- timation in the performance of TMTPSS and TM func- tionals.
The performance of SCAN functional is quite11 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) FIG. 3.
Histograms of relative error in cohesive energies (in %) are presented.
The numbering of the ﬁgures are as the order of the solids presented in TABLE III.
better compared to the TM based functionals.
Other transition metals : The cohesive energy of Mn is largely overestimated within all the GGA and meta-GGA functionals except MS0, MS1 and SCAN functionals.
Overall the M06L, “MS” and SCAN func- tionals predict the best MAE for all these metals.
The TM functional predicts very well cohesive energies for La and Hg.
As usual the TM functional enhance the error of TMTPSS more.
Unlike other transition metals, in this case, we observe that the revTPSS and PBEsol results deviate from each other.
Overall performances : Overall, the PBE performs quite reasonably for the cohesive energies.
Within the meta-GGA functionals, the TPSS performs quite well and predicts the overall best MAE within the meta- GGAs.
The PBEsol and revTPSS perform equivalently.
We also obtain the same degree of overall ME and MAE using the M06L, MS0, MS1, MS2 and SCAN functionals.
The TM functional deviates more from accuracy in pre- dicting the cohesive energies of alkali, alkaline-earth, and transition metals.
The errors obtained from the TM func- tional are often more enhanced than that of the TMTPSS functional. IV.
CHALLENGES OF ADVANCE META-GGA FUNCTIONALS In TABLE IV we present the overall statistical anal- ysis and ranking of each functional best on their perfor- mance.
In Fig.(4), we present the mean absolute per- centage of the individual functionals excluding the Mn, La and Hg.
Based on these analyses it is indicative that simultaneously predicting both the structural and ener- getic properties of the transition metals within GGAs and meta-GGAs functionals possess great challenge.
Meta- GGA functionals belong to the third rung of the Ja- cob’s ladder.
Within the meta-GGAs, the SCAN and TM functionals considered as one of the most advanced functionals but the performance of those functionals do not show any improvement over the PBE functionals for the bulk moduli and cohesive energies.
For the 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals the SCAN and TM functionals improve the performance but for the 3d transition metals PBE performs better.
The SCAN, M06L and TM functionals capture mid-range vdW interactions, which accounts improve performance for some systems but remain diﬃcult for other systems.
Especially, for alkali metals, the TMTPSS and TM func- tionals show improvement over PBE, M06L, and SCAN functionals.
In the present study, we do not include any long-range corrected vdW interactions into the function- als form.
The inclusion of the long-range corrected vdW12 FIG.

V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we assess the performance of the recent meta-GGA density functionals along with the popularly used GGA based functionals for the lattice constants, bulk moduli and cohesive energies of alkali, alkaline- earth, and transition metals.
The present paper is ar- ranged by addressing the performance of the 3d, 4d, 5d, alkali, alkaline-earth, and other transition metals.
Due to the complicated structure of the Mn, La, and Hg, we discuss these three materials separately.
Special atten- tion has been paid to the performance on the recently proposed SCAN, TMTPSS and TM functionals.
Based on these analysis, benchmark calculations and the level of deﬁciencies of all the functionals one conclude that: (i) For the equilibrium shortest distances of the 3d transition metals PBE results reasonably good compared to all other GGAs and meta-GGAs.
For 4d and 5d transition metals, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals the PBE results are too large except few cases.
The PBEsol13 and revTPSS follow essentially the identical results.
The largest error is obtained from the M06L functional.
The performance of MS0 and MS1 are identical, whereas, MS2 and SCAN closely follow each other in most of the cases.
We obtain the best performance with the TM functional.
The TM perform even better than SCAN in most of the cases except alkaline-earth metals.
We found the perfor- mance of TMTPSS is quite close that of the TM func- tional for 3d transition metals.
(ii) Regarding the bulk moduli, the PBE functional outperforms all other semilocal GGAs and meta-GGAs functionals in every case.
Overall PBE underestimates the bulk moduli of 4d transition metals, 5d transition metals, alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals.
For 3d metals the PBE seems to overestimate the results.
The bulk moduli of Mn is a diﬃcult case for all the GGAs and meta-GGAs functionals.
In this case, the revTPSS results also follows very closely the PBEsol results.
The performance of all other meta-GGAs vary noticeably from the PBE results.
Concerning the performance of TMTPSS and TM functional performance, both perform well then the SCAN functional.
(iii) In predicting the cohesive energies of all the met- als, PBE outperforms all other functionals.
Only for the alkali metals, the PBE results deviate from the experi- mental results.
The revTPSS closely follow the PBEsol in all the cases.
Overall consideration shows that the TM predicts the largest mean absolute error.
Though in the case of the alkali metals, the TMTPSS and TM function- als perform quite well compared to the other cases, but overall both the functionals overestimate the cohesive en- ergies.
Overall, comparison of SCAN, TMTPSS and TM show that the SCAN functional performs better compare to the TMTPSS and TM functional in estimation the co- hesive energies. VI.
