arXiv:physics/0508128v2  [physics.chem-ph]  30 Nov 2005 Enhanced dispersion interaction in conﬁned geometry Michal Marcovitch1 and Haim Diamant2, ∗ 1School of Physics & Astronomy 2School of Chemistry Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel (Dated: October 2, 2005) The dispersion interaction between two point-like particles conﬁned in a dielectric slab between two plates of another dielectric medium is studied within a continuum (Lifshitz) theory.
The retarded (Casimir-Polder) interaction at large interparticle distances is found to be strongly enhanced as the mismatch between the dielectric permittivities of the two media is increased.
The large-distance interaction is multiplied due to conﬁnement by a factor of (33γ5/2+13γ−3/2)/46 at zero temperature, and by (5γ2 + γ−2)/6 at ﬁnite temperature, γ = ǫin(0)/ǫout(0) being the ratio between the static dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer media.
This conﬁnement-induced ampliﬁcation of the dispersion interaction can reach several orders of magnitude.
PACS numbers: 34.20.-b, 03.65.Sq, 82.70.-y The dispersion interaction acts between any two po- larizable objects, thus being one of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature [1, 2].
It plays a central role in numerous phenomena in chemical physics and materials science, including gas–liquid condensation, capillarity [3], inter-surface interactions [4], and colloid stability [5].
The dispersion interaction is a quantum ﬂuctuation- induced coupling between two polarizable particles me- diated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In an unconﬁned system at zero temperature there is a single length scale with which the interparticle distance R is to be com- pared, i.e., the characteristic wavelength λ0 of photon absorption by the particles, typically in the ultravio- let to visible range.
London’s calculation [6], valid in the nonretarded limit R ≪λ0, yields the poten- tial U(R) = −[(3¯h/π) R ∞ 0 dξα2(iξ)]R−6, where α(ω) is the frequency-dependent polarizability of the particles.
Casimir and Polder [7] recast the problem in quantum- electrodynamic terms, whereby the interaction arises from the eﬀect of the particles on the zero-point modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
For R ≪λ0 the Casimir- Polder result coincides with London’s, yet in the re- tarded limit, R ≫λ0, the interaction decays as R−7, U(R) = −[(23/(4π))¯hcα2(0)]R−7 [8].
As a result, the dispersion interaction between two particles in the re- tarded regime (typically R > 0.1 µm) is extremely weak and has not been directly observed.
(Particle–surface and surface–surface interactions across such micron-scale dis- tances are much stronger and were successfully measured in the 1990s [9, 10].) In the current Letter we demon- strate that this weak particle–particle interaction can be dramatically ampliﬁed in conﬁned geometries.
At a ﬁnite temperature T another length scale appears, i.e., the thermal wavelength λT = ¯hc/T ≃7.6 µm at room temperature.
(The Boltzmann constant is set here- after to unity.) As was shown in Ref.
[11], retardation and ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects are intertwined.
For R ≫λT , the Helmholtz free energy of interaction returns to a R−6 dependence, F(R) = −3T α2(0)R−6.
The theory of dispersion interactions was extended by Lifshitz et al. to the case where the interacting objects as well as the intervening space are continuous media [12, 13].
In this continuum theory the material response to electromagnetic ﬁelds is assumed to be fully captured by the complex, frequency-dependent dielectric permit- tivity ǫ(ω) [14].
The current work is based on such a continuum approach.
Despite the strong underlying as- sumption (after all, the media themselves consist of dis- crete polarizable particles), the Lifshitz theory has been widely used and experimentally corroborated [4].
It is expected to yield valid results so long as the distance between the two particles is much larger than the inter- molecular distances in the materials.
In various circumstances particles are spatially con- ﬁned, e.g., in porous media, micro-cavities, biological constrictions or nanoﬂuidic devices.
Such conﬁnement in- troduces a new length scale, the separation h between the bounding surfaces.
The dispersion interaction between a single particle and conﬁning surfaces has been exten- sively studied in the context of cavity QED [9, 15].
The eﬀect of conﬁnement on the interaction between two par- ticles, however, has been only partially addressed.
Con- ﬁnement by two metallic plates (i.e., the limit where the permittivity of the outer medium ǫout →∞) was found to drastically aﬀect the interaction between two point-like particles in vacuum at zero [16] and nonzero [17] temper- atures.
The nonretarded interaction between particles conﬁned by two dielectric plates at T = 0 was addressed within a single-image approximation in Ref. [18].
We fol- low the lines of Mahanty, Ninham, Bostr¨om and Longdell [16, 17] and extend their theory to the general and more practical case of arbitrary permittivities of both inner and outer media, discovering a dramatic enhancement for experimentally relevant values of ǫin and ǫout.
The system under consideration is schematically shown in Fig. 1.
Two point-like, isotropic particles of polariz-2 ability α(ω) are embedded in a slab of thickness h and dielectric permittivity ǫin(ω).
The slab is bounded by two semi-inﬁnite media of dielectric permittivity ǫout(ω).
We use cylindrical coordinates, r = (ρ, ϕ, z), the ˆz axis taken perpendicular to the bounding surfaces.
For simplicity we specialize to the symmetric case where the particles lie on the slab midplane, z = h/2, connected by the vector R = (R, 0, 0).
All materials are assumed nonmagnetic.

1: Schematic view of the system and its parameters.
We employ the semiclassical scheme introduced by Ma- hanty and Ninham, which accurately reproduces the Lon- don and Casimir-Polder results [19].
In this theory the energy of interaction at T = 0 is given by [1] T = 0 : U(R) = −8π¯h Z ∞ 0 dξ ξ4 c4 α2(iξ) ×Tr[G(R, iξ)G(−R, iξ)], (1) and the Helmholtz free energy at ﬁnite T by T > 0 : F(R) = −(4π)2T ∞ X′ n=0 α2(iξn)(ξ4 n/c4) ×Tr[G(R, iξn)G(−R, iξn)], ξn = (2πc/λT )n, (2) the prime indicating that the n = 0 term is multiplied by 1/2. In Eqs.
(1) and (2) R = r−r′, and G(r, r′, ω) is the dyadic Green tensor of the electric-ﬁeld wave equation, ∇× ∇× G −ǫm(ω)(ω2/c2)G = Iδ(r −r′), (3) where I is the identity tensor and ǫm = ǫin or ǫout de- pending on whether r lies in the inner or outer medium.
(The position r′ is taken inside the slab.) The boundary conditions in the current case are continuity across the bounding surfaces of the tangential components of both the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
This imposes continuity on ˆz × G and ˆz × ∇× G across z = 0 and z = h.
Thus, this scheme reduces the problem to ﬁnding the Green tensor G(r, r′, ω) of Eq. (3) with the aforemen- tioned boundary conditions.
The derivation is techni- cally complicated and can be found in Refs. [20, 21].
In the symmetric case of interest, r′ = (0, 0, h/2) and r = (R, 0, h/2), the tensor becomes diagonal, ξ2 c2 Gij(R, iξ) = 1 4πǫin(iξ)R3 Z ∞ 0 dxgi(R, iξ, x)δij gρ = [q2x(ev −t)(ev −u)J0(x) −(x2(e2v + tu) −ev(p2 + q2)(t + u))J1(x)]/[q(ev −t)(ev + u)] gϕ = [p2x(ev + t)(ev + u)J0(x) + (x2(e2v + tu) −ev(p2 + q2)(t + u))J1(x)]/[q(ev −t)(ev + u)] gz = −x3(ev + u)J0(x)/[q(ev −u)], (4) where Jk(x) are Bessel functions, and the following ab- breviations have been used: γ = ǫin/ǫout, p = Rξǫ1/2 in /c, q = (x2 + p2)1/2, s = (x2 + p2/γ)1/2, t = (q −s)/(q + s), u = (q −γs)/(q + γs), and v = hq/R. Given ǫin,out(iξ) and α(iξ), one can substitute Eq. (4) in Eq. (1) or (2) and calculate numerically the interaction potential.
It is instructive, however, to ﬁrst analyze the inter- action in several asymptotic limits.
We begin with the small-distance limit, recovering the known results for unconﬁned particles.
For R ≪h the expressions for gi are expanded to leading order in large v, where- upon the integration in Eq. (4) can be carried out an- alytically.
Substituting the result in Eq. (1), we get U(R) = −(¯h/π)R−6 R ∞ 0 dξe−2p(3 + 6p + 5p2 + 2p3 + p4)α2(iξ)/ǫ2 in(iξ).
In the nonretarded limit, R ≪λ0, we take the leading order in small p, for which the London result is recovered, T = 0, R ≪h, λ0 : U(R) = −3¯h πR6 Z ∞ 0 dξ α2(iξ) ǫ2 in(iξ), (5) with the appropriate correction due to the fact that the particles are not in vacuum (ǫin ̸= 1).
In the retarded limit, R ≫λ0, the integral over ξ is dominated by small (static) ξ.
An asymptotic analysis then recovers the Casimir-Polder result with the correction for ǫin ̸= 1, T = 0, λ0 ≪R ≪h : U(R) = −23¯hcα2(0) 4πǫ5/2 in (0)R7 .
(6) Similarly, substitution of the asymptotic Green tensor for R ≪ h in Eq. (2) yields F(R) = −2T R−6 P′∞ n=0 e−2pn(3 + 6pn + 5p2 n + 2p3 n + p4 n)α2(iξn)/ǫ2 in(iξn), where pn = Rξnǫ1/2 in /c.
Subse- quently taking the limit R ≪λT , we expand to leading order in small pn [22] and recover the known result for the nonretarded interaction at ﬁnite temperature [23], T > 0, R ≪h, λT : F(R) = −6T R6 ∞ X′ n=0 α2(iξn) ǫ2 in(iξn).
(7) In the other limit, R ≫λT , the sum is dominated by the n = 0 term, leading to the known retarded interaction at ﬁnite temperature [11], T > 0, λT ≪R ≪h : F(R) = −3T α2(0) ǫ2 in(0)R6 .
(8)3 We now turn to the more interesting asymptotic limit of large R where conﬁnement sets in.
In the limit R ≫h the expressions for gi in Eq. (4) are expanded to lead- ing order in small v, and the integration in Eq. (4) is performed analytically.
The result is substituted in Eq. (1) to yield U(R) = −(¯h/(2π))R−6 R ∞ 0 dξe−2¯p[(5 + γ−4) + (10 + 2γ−4)¯p + (7 + 3γ−4)¯p2 + (2 + 2γ−4)¯p3 + (1 + γ−4)¯p4]α2(iξ)/ǫ2 out(iξ), where ¯p = γ−1/2p.
In the non- retarded regime, this expression is expanded to leading order in small ¯p, leading to T = 0, h ≪R ≪λ0 : (9) U(R) = −3¯h πR6 Z ∞ 0 dξ α2(iξ) ǫ2 in(iξ) 5γ2(iξ) + γ−2(iξ) 6 .
Equation (9) gives the nonretarded interaction under conﬁnement.
It reduces to the London result, Eq. (5), for γ = ǫin/ǫout = 1.
This result has a rather restricted validity as it requires that h be much smaller than λ0.
(A detailed discussion of the conﬁned nonretarded inter- action will be given elsewhere.) In the retarded regime the integral is dominated by small ξ, leading to T = 0, R ≫h, λ0 : U(R) = −23¯hcα2(0) 4πǫ5/2 in (0)R7 33γ5/2 + 13γ−3/2 46 , (10) where we have written γ(0) = γ for brevity.
This re- tarded interaction under conﬁnement converges to the Casimir-Polder expression, Eq. (6), for γ = 1.
At ﬁnite temperature we substitute the asymptotic Green tensor for R ≫h in Eq. (2), resulting in F(R) = −T R−6 P′∞ n=0 e−2¯pn[(5 + γ−4) + (10 + 2γ−4)¯pn + (7 + 3γ−4)¯p2 n + (2 + 2γ−4)¯p3 n + (1 + γ−4)¯p4 n]α2(iξn)/ǫ2 out(iξn), where ¯pn = Rξnǫ1/2 out/c. For R ≪λT we take the leading order in small ¯pn [22] and get T > 0, h ≪R ≪λT : (11) F(R) = −6T R6 ∞ X′ n=0 α2(iξn) ǫ2 in(iξn) 5γ2(iξn) + γ−2(iξn) 6 .
This is the extension of Eq. (7) to the conﬁned case.
For R ≫λT , the n = 0 term dominates the sum, yielding T > 0, R ≫h, λT : F(R) = −3T α2(0) ǫ2 in(0)R6 5γ2 + γ−2 6 , (12) which extends Eq. (8) to the conﬁned geometry.
Equations (10) and (12) are our central results.
They account for the large-distance, retarded dispersion inter- action between the conﬁned particles at zero and ﬁnite temperature, respectively. Comparing with Eqs.
(6) and (8), we see that the conﬁnement is manifest as a factor dependent on the ratio γ(0) between the static dielectric permittivities of the inner and outer media.
This factor can be as small as 0.78 [Eq. (10)] or 0.75 [Eq. (12)], but in- creases indeﬁnitely with the permittivity mismatch.
The divergence of the interaction energy for γ →0 or ∞ is obviously unphysical.
Although Eqs. (10) and (12) are asymptotically correct for any ﬁnite mismatch, as γ becomes increasingly large or small one must go to ever larger interparticle distances for these asymptotes to hold.
Ultimately, in the limits γ →0, ∞their range of validity disappears, and the large-distance interaction obeys a diﬀerent power law [16, 17].
(Detailed analy- sis of this behavior will be given elsewhere.) The main point, however, is that the ampliﬁcation factor can be very large for reasonable values of γ.
For example, for particles embedded in a polar liquid [ǫin(0) = 80] which is conﬁned by glass plates [ǫout(0) = 4] at room temper- ature, one gets an ampliﬁcation factor of about 300.
If the outer medium is a gas (a free-standing ﬁlm, ǫout = 1), the factor increases to about 5000 [24].
Finally, we present results from numerical integration of Eqs.
(2) and (4) for two examples of practical inter- est.
This requires expressions for ǫ(iξ) of the various media, for which we use the Ninham-Parsegian repre- sentation [2, 25], an empirical ﬁt based on electromag- netic absorption spectra of the materials.
In the ﬁrst example two polystyrene particles are conﬁned in a slab of water between two glass plates at room temperature.
The function ǫin(iξ) for water is found in Refs.
[2, 5] and that for silica glass, ǫout(iξ), in Ref. [25].
For α(iξ) we took the excess Clausius-Mossotti polarizability [4] of a polystyrene sphere, α(iξ)/V = [3ǫin(iξ)/(4π)][ǫPS(iξ) − ǫin(iξ)]/[ǫPS(iξ) + 2ǫin(iξ)], V being the particle volume and ǫPS(iξ) the permittivity of polystyrene, found in Refs. [2, 5].
The resulting potentials for two interplate separations, h = 1 and 0.1 µm, are shown in Fig. 2(a) along with the unconﬁned potential.
The interaction per volume squared has been scaled by −T/R6.
The curves, therefore, represent the eﬀective Hamaker coeﬃcient (di- vided by π2, in units of T ) as a function of interparticle distance.
The unconﬁned potential clearly exhibits the crossover from the nonretarded R−6 regime at small R to the retarded R−7 dependence at intermediate distances, and then back to the R−6 decay due to temperature.
The conﬁned interaction deviates from the unconﬁned one at distances R >∼h.
The ampliﬁcation factor in- creases moderately with distance until saturating to the asymptotic value given in Eq. (12).
In the second ex- ample two polystyrene particles are conﬁned in a hydro- carbon slab of thickness h = 3 nm, which is embedded in water.
This may mimic small hydrophobic inclusions in a biological membrane.
For the oily environment we used the permittivity ǫin(iξ) of pentane [1].
As is seen in Fig. 2(b) , the ampliﬁcation becomes signiﬁcant only at R >∼10h.
This is because for smaller distances retar- dation has not yet set in.
(Note where the unconﬁned potential departs from its nonretarded R−6 behavior.)

Insets in both panels present the ratio be- tween the conﬁned and unconﬁned potentials, the dash-dotted lines showing the asymptotic ampliﬁcation factor of Eq. (12).
dispersion interaction can be viewed as a consequence of multiple-reﬂection waveguiding of the electromagnetic radiation between the boundaries.
Despite the demon- strated strong eﬀect the interaction remains weak.
In the example presented in Fig. 2(a), for instance, the in- teraction free energy for h = 1 µm and R = 10 µm is about 3 × 10−6 T/µm6.
Nevertheless, to achieve the same energy without conﬁnement one would have to set the interparticle distance at about 2 µm.
Thus, besides the fundamental signiﬁcance of the strong conﬁnement eﬀect reported here for particle interactions in conﬁned systems, it may become useful also in extending the range of observation of the Casimir-Polder interaction.

[14] In fact, all the results depend only on the values of the di- electric functions along the imaginary axis, ǫ(iξ) with real ξ [1].
These are real, positive, monotonously decreasing functions of ξ involving the imaginary part of ǫ(ω) alone.
