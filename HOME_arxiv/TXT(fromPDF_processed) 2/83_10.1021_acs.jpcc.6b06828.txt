Understanding nanoscale optical  behavior of the edges and grain boundaries of synthetically grown TMDCs is vital for optimizing their  optoelectronic properties.
Elucidating the nanoscale optical properties of 2D materials through far- field optical microscopy requires a diffraction-limited optical beam diameter sub-micron in size.
Here  we present our experimental work on spatial photoluminescence (PL) scanning of large size ( 50 m) monolayer MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a diffraction limited blue laser  beam spot (wavelength 405 nm) with a beam diameter as small as ∼200 nm allowing us to probe  nanoscale excitonic phenomena which was not observed before.
We have found several important  features: (i) there exists a sub-micron width strip (~500 nm) along the edges that fluoresces ~1000%  brighter than the region far inside; (ii) there is another brighter wide region consisting of parallel  fluorescing lines ending at the corners of the zig-zag peripheral edges; (iii) there is a giant blue  shifted A-excitonic peak, as large as ∼120 meV, in the PL spectra from the edges.
Using density  functional theory calculations, we attribute this giant blue shift to the adsorption of oxygen dimers at  the edges, which reduces the excitonic binding energy.
Our results not only shed light on defect- induced excitonic properties, but also offer an attractive route to tailor optical properties at the  TMDC edges through defect engineering.2  INTRODUCTIONS The direct band gap properties of monolayer transition  metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) provide the tantalizing  prospect of miniaturizing semiconductor devices to truly  atomic scales and accelerating the advances of many  two-dimensional (2D) optoelectronic devices.1 2D  confinement, direct band-gap nature2 and weak  screening of charge carriers enhance the light-matter  interactions2-4  in  these  materials,  leading  to  extraordinarily high absorption, electron-hole (e-h)  creation and exciton formation (a hydrogenic entity  made of an e-h pair).
These extraordinary properties  make TMDCs very attractive for optoelectronic  applications1, 5-9 including low power transistors,10  sensitive  photodetectors,5,  11-13 energy  harvesting  devices,14-16 atomically thin LEDs,6, 8, 9 single photon  sources17-21 and nanocavity lasers.22 To realize TMDCs  for practical application, we need to understand the  optical properties of edges, which become dominant as  devices shrink to nanoscale.23 The edges are also  important for photocatalytic, electrocatalytic and  hydrosulfphurization process24.
In addition to the atomic edges, other structural defects  may also have pronounced effects.
Recent advances in  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have allowed batch  production of monolayer TMDCs with macroscopic size  and uniform atomic thickness.25-28 However, these  synthesized films are polycrystalline in nature largely  because of the coalescence of disoriented domains,29-31,  which affect their electrical32, 33 and optical properties.30 It is therefore of paramount importance to understand  the optical properties of the edges of these misoriented  domains.
So far the far-field optical properties of TMDCs  have been studied using conventional scanning micro- photoluminescence (µPL) microscopy that employs  micron sized or larger optical beams29, 30, 34 lacking  sufficient resolution to probe the optical properties of  the edges and the grain boundaries.
Here we report our study using a scanning far-field PL  mapping employing an ultra-narrow optical beam (~200  nm) that has allowed us to observe three important  excitonic features at the atomic edges and the grain  boundaries of large size chemical vapor deposited (CVD)  grown large monolayer-MoS2 (1L-MoS2) flakes.
First,  there exists a submicron (width ~500 nm) narrow strip  of higher fluorescent region at the outermost edges of  monolayer MoS2 flakes.
Second, there is a wide (~5-10  µm) fluorescent region just inside the peripheral edge,  comprised of multiple parallel submicron fluorescent  lines.
Finally, the A-exciton originating from both the  single crystalline edges and polycrystalline boundaries is  significantly blue shifted (~120 meV) relative to interior  fluorescence.
Through density functional theory (DFT)  calculations, we attribute the giant blue shift  phenomenon of the A-exciton to the reduced screening  strength originating from the adsorption of oxygen  dimers at the edges and grain boundaries.
Our study not  only  elucidates  the  intricate  defect-related  luminescence properties in the edges, but also provides  a pathway, through defect engineering, for the next  generation of optical and optoelectronic devices.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We conducted high resolution PL scanning using a laser  scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss 710 Axiovert) with  an oil objective of high numerical aperture (NA=1.4).
Here we raster scanned a focused excitation laser (~  405 nm) over the sample and recorded PL spectra at  each point.
The sample was covered by a thin film of  water, encapsulated by a cover slip, as shown  schematically in Figure 1a.
We successfully focused the  beam to a spot size of diameter ~200 nm, i.e. the beam  area is ~25 times smaller than the micron sized beam  area used in conventional scanning PL system.
The  beam diameter was confirmed with a calibrated  fluorescent bead of diameter 200 nm (see Supporting  Information), and all measurements were conducted at  room temperature.
The power intensity of the laser was  ~3 mW and the dwell time at each pixel~100 µs.
The  reflection image of one of the 1L-MoS2 sample is shown  in Figure 1b.
The darker region on the flake is  originating from bilayer spots.
We have studied in total  11 samples and all demonstrate similar results (see  Supporting Information).
Since this high resolution  microscopy requires a thin aqueous layer between a  Figure 1: (a) The experimental setup is shown schematically  (not to scale).
The sample was covered by water and  encapsulated by a cover slip (thickness~0.17 mm).
We have  used an oil objective to enhance the numerical aperture.

The scale bar is 20  µm.
Note that the darker specs are small multilayer nucleation  flakes.3  cover slip and the sample, all measurements were  carried out in air at room temperature.
High resolution fluorescence image of a large triangular  1L-MoS2 sample is shown in Figure 2a.
In all the  previous studies, the researchers have reported a wide  region of fluorescence at the edges.30, 35 What is unique  in our high resolution spatial mapping is that we  successfully resolved the fluorescing regions near the  edges and found that the brighter edges actually  consists of two distinct regions of brighter intensity.
First, our spatial mapping shows a submicron  fluorescent strip of width ~500 nm along the flake edge.
The intensity profile along a line drawn across this strip  is shown inset in Figure 2b, and reveals fluorescence  intensities of ~400% higher than inner regions.
For three  samples, we observed edge fluorescence intensity  ~1000%  larger  than  interior  (see  Supporting  Information).
This extraordinarily large spike in intensity  may arise from point defects, which can trap free  charge carriers and localized excitons.36 Using scanning  tunneling microscopy (STM), it has been demonstrated  that point defects, such as S vacancies, could form at  flake edges.37, 38   Second, our spatial PL mapping shows another wider  band along the edges consisting of parallel fluorescent  lines(as marked by arrows in Figure 2b).
Interestingly,  these parallel lines originate from the zig-zag corners of  the periphery, as is clearly visible in the blow-up image  presented in Figure 2b.
These fluorescent parallel lines  have a spatial width of ~500nm and fluoresce with  intensity ~100% higher than neighboring spots.
We  suggest that these fluorescent lines originate from line  defects, which are boundaries between two opposite  rotation domains of the 3-fold symmetric MoS2 lattice,  as has been observed in STM measurements of physical  vapor deposited MoS2 on Au (111) substrat,39 and  scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of  CVD-grown MoS2 on SiO2.37 Here we have observed the  optical signature of these line defects for the first time.
This suggests that, although the reflection image of a  large 1L-MoS2 shows seamless integration into a single  crystalline entity (as in Figure 1b), the flake actually  consists of multiple domains, as evidenced by the  fluorescing line defects along grain boundaries.
Brighter  luminescence from the defects suggests that these line  defects may trap excitons and similar to the point  defects at the periphery.
To understand the origin of the brighter edges, we have  further investigated wavelength-resolved PL scans of  our 1L-MoS2 samples.
After pumping the flakes with a  ~405 nm laser, we observed a major luminescence peak  shift across the sample, ranging from 660 nm at the  edge to 710 nm further inwards.
This peak in PL, also  known as A-exciton peak (A-peak), has been attributed  to the recombination of photoexcited excitons across  Figure 2: (a) The fluorescence image of a 1L-MoS2 flake.
(b) Blow-up view of the dashed-square in (a).
The  fluorescent image is showing many parallel brighter lines matching with the zig-zag edges and marked by white  arrows.
The inset is showing the intensity profile along the white line drawn on the edges.4  the direct band gap at the K-point.2, 4 The spatial  mapping of the wavelength values of the A-peak for  that  same  large  triangular  flake  and  another  polycrystalline sample are shown in Figure 3a and Figure  3c-d, respectively.
Figure 3b shows the PL spectra of  two locations in the sample shown in Figure 3a, one at  the periphery, the other just inside.
Here the peak  positions were obtained by fitting the PL data for every  pixel using a Gaussian profile.
For the pixels for which  Gaussian fitting was not possible, i.e., for the pixel  outside the flake, the color was set to white.
A very  strong blue shifted A-peak is observed at the flake  edges relative to interior.
The maximum energy of the  edge A-peak is ~1.89 eV (~656 nm) and the minimum  energy of the interior A-peak is 1.77 eV (~703 nm).
This  is a total upshift of ~120 meV, approximately ~3 times  larger than previously reported values35.
To investigate the effect of the beam diameter on the  PL mapping, we varied laser beam size.
We observed  the upshift values decrease significantly as we  employed a wider beam spot; specifically, the blue shift  decreased to ~ 20 meV as we doubled the beam  diameter (from 200 to 400 nm).
For a few micron sized  beam, there was no observable blue shift.
These  findings are expected, as a wider beam includes PL  signal from areas further into the flake's interior,  averaging out the A-Peak and minimizing the blue shift.
We will now discuss possible origins of our observations  of giant blue shifts of A-exciton peaks.
Various studies  have shown that large shifts of the A-exciton peak can  originate from edge stress or compression,40-43 neutral  exction-trion population35, spatial confinement44 or  defects.45-47 Specifically, it has been experimentally  demonstrated that compressive strain can lead to a blue  shift in the A-exciton peak;43 and furthermore, DFT  calculations have predicted that the edges of MoS2  flakes are in fact naturally compressed relative to the  inside.48 Hence, the presence of compressive strain at  the edges can cause a blue shift in the A-peak.
To  examine the effects of edge strain on our observed  optical properties, we also studied the spatial scanning  of PL for several 1L-MoS2 samples prepared by  microexfoliation, and did not observe any blue-shifted  edges as shown in Fig.3e-f.
We have examined more  than five microexfoliated 1L-MoS2 samples and  observed similar results.
Thus, we argue, the observed  giant blue shift of the A-peak cannot be due to  compressive strain at the edges.
Observed giant blue  shift of the A-exciton can also arise from the  competition between trion and neutral exciton  population.
Since we have observed much larger blue  shift than the binding energy of the trions (~20 meV),  we can safely rule out that the observed giant blue shift  is originating from the relative completion between  trion and neutral exciton population.
It has been demonstrated that spatial confinement  reduces screening strength and increases the Coulomb  interaction and exciton binding energy.49, 50 Hence, it is  expected that spatial confinement at the edges of 1L- MoS2  would modify the exciton binding energy and  luminescing photon energy.
The width of region for  which the A-peak has been blue shifted, however, is ~  500 nm, very large compared to the physical size of the  excitons (~1-3 nm).53 Moreover, we have not observed  any blue shift for the A-exciton in the microexfoliated  samples, where excitons will encounter similar edge  confinement.
Thus, it is unlikely that the large blue shift  originates from the spatial confinement at the edge.
Now we will concentrate on edge defects, and how they  can modify the PL A-peak as well as fluorescence  intensity.
Edge defects were explored using first- principles DFT calculations (See detailed in Methods).
To  model the flakes used in the experiments, here we used  a nano ribbon that is periodic in one direction with a  finite width in the other.
All the calculations have been  performed using a MoS2 nanoribbon with a width of 5.2  nm.
The width is long enough to eliminate the effect of  the edges on the middle of the ribbon, as shown by the  converged DOS when moving from the edge towards  the middle in Figure 4b (top panel).
The MoS2 nanoribbons used in our calculations are  shown in Figure 4a and 4c.
The ribbon was terminated  by two edges, the S-edge and the Mo-edge.
Previous  studies of MoS2 nanocrystals using atomic resolution  STM have shown that both edges may be present.38, 51, 52  The Mo edge exhibits a specific metallic electronic  structure and has been shown to dominate in triangular  MoS2 nanocrystals supported on  Au(111) surface.53 The  Mo edge has been shown to be the key active site for  hydrogen evolution reaction54 and hydrodesulfurization  reaction.55 Figure 4b(top) shows the projected density  of states (PDOS) of each Mo atom across the  nanoribbons since the d states of the Mo atoms  dominate the band edge states.
The two edges show  some metallic character in agreement with a previous  STM study.53 When moving towards the middle of the  ribbon, there is less difference between the Mo atoms,  all of which converge to the bulk electronic structure.
It has been shown experimentally that S vacancies form  at the edges,37, 38 which can be saturated by oxygen in5  the current fabrication process.
The oxidation of the  edges has also been reported experimentally in STM  measurements of air-exposed monolayer WSe2.56  Previous calculations suggested local strain at the grain  boundaries in a 1L layered materials  might also attract  and accumulate oxygen.57 Here we studied oxygen  monomers at different locations across the nanoribbon,  and found no significant change of the formation energy  of a substitutional oxygen impurity (that is, replacement  of an S atom by an O).
However, for the oxygen dimer,  which forms by adsorption of an oxygen molecule at a  sulfur vacancy, it is more energetically favorable by 0.6  eV at the Mo-edge and 0.4 eV at the S-edge as  compared to the middle of the ribbon (Figure 4c), which  indicates a non-homogeneous distribution of oxygen  dimers.
Figure 4b (lower) plots the PDOS of each Mo  atom when an oxygen dimer is located at the Mo-edge  (the most stable configuration).
A more pronounced  electronic resonance from the edge atom (index n = 18)  is caused by the oxygen dimer, which introduces more  valence electrons than the replaced S atom that  previously occupied the position.
In addition, there is  also a gradual downshift of the valence band with  respect to the Fermi level when moving towards the  Mo-edge as schematically shown in Figure 4d.
This  downshift of the valence bands is caused by a surface  dipole resulting from the oxygen-induced charge  redistribution, which is also shown by the change of the  Figure 3: Spatial mapping of the A-peak position.

(f) Spatial mapping of the A-peak of  the micro-exfoliated sample shown in (e).6  local electrostatic potential plotted above the MoS2  surface (see Figure S5in Supplementary Information).
The correlation between the increased electron density,  which is mainly localized at the edge of the ribbon,  suggested by the calculations and the blue shift of the  PL at the edges found experimentally suggests that  enhanced screening of the excited electron from its  counterpart – the remaining hole in the valence band –  may lead to a reduced exciton binding energy, and  provides an explanation for the blue shift of the PL peak  at the edges.
Intriguingly, our findings using a far-field optical  microscope involving a ultra-narrow beam  is very  different from results recently reported by Bao et al.35  using a ~60 nm diameter beam in a near-field scanning  optical microscope setup.
First, we have observed larger  (~2.5 times) blue shift of the A-excitons at the  periphery.
Second, we have observed exciton-enhancing  at the periphery in agreement to other studies30,  whereas Bao et al., observed exciton-quenching  luminescence.
Though not understood currently, the  discrepancies may be attributed to different sample  growth procedures and different sizes of the samples  (our samples are at least one order larger), both of  which may affect the defect concentration and in turn  the PL measurement.
CONCLUSIONS  In  summary,  we  obtained  ultra-high  resolution  fluorescence imaging and spatial mapping of 1L-MoS2  using a narrow optical beam and found several  important characteristics at the edges.
We observed a  strip of brighter fluorescence at the outermost edge,  and another wide region of brighter luminescence  consisting of submicron parallel lines originating from  sharp zig-zig corners due to line defects.
The latter  suggests that large flakes are in fact polycrystalline at  the edges.
Moreover, we observed a giant blue shifted  A-exciton peak at the edges.
Through DFT calculations,  we have attributed this blue shift to the oxygen dimer  absorption at the edges, which reduces the binding  energy of the exciton, resulting in a blue shifted A- exciton peak.
Our results are important for  informing  the design of next generation truly nanoscale or atomic  scale optical and optoelectronic devices, since edge  effects become dominant as devices reduce in size to  the nanoscale.

The layer thickness of the  grown sample was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy59- 61 and atomic force microscopy (see supplementary  information).27, 62    Computational Methods: The density functional theory  (DFT) calculations were carried out using the VASP  package.63  The  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PBE)  generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange- correlation potential64 was used, and the electron-core  interactions were treated in the projector augmented  wave (PAW) method.65, 66 All the calculations have been  performed using a MoS2 nanoribbon with a length of 5.2  nm.
Structures have been optimized using a single Γ  point of the Brillouin zone with a kinetic cut off energy  of 400 eV. The structure was fully relaxed until atomic  forces were smaller than 0.02 eV Å-1.

S5: Calculation of Local electrostatic potential and charge distribution   Fig. S5 shows the calculated electrostatic potential along the ribbon.
The asymmetric  potential, which is lower at the Mo-edge, where the oxygen dimer absorbs, and lifted at the  S-edge, as compared to the symmetric curve of the pristine MoS2 ribbon, is caused by the  oxygen atoms.
The downshifted local electrostatic potential agrees with the lower valence  band position close to the Mo-edge (Figure 4 in the main text).
We believe that the excess  electrons at the Mo-edge and the oxygen atoms cause a surface dipole pointing towards the  50 µm4    nanoribbon leading to the lower local electrostatic potential, or correspondingly a higher  local work function.
Figure S5: Calculated local electrostatic potential and Bader charge distribution with  (red) and without (black) oxygen at the Mo-edge of the MoS2 nanoribbon.
(top) The  averaged electrostatic potential of the y-plane, (perpendicular to the paper) and along  the infinite ribbon direction, plotted as a function of the position along the x-direction.
Vacuum level is set to zero.
(bottom) the Bader charge plotted as a function of the x  coordinate of each Mo atom.
The two dashed lines indicate the edge positions.
Moreover, Bader charge1 in Fig. S5 (bottom panel) shows that the Mo atoms at the Mo-edge  have less electrons when an oxygen dimer replaces an S atom.
It should be noted that Mo  has 6 valence electrons.
The Bader charge suggests that most Mo atoms are Mo2+, and  oxygen further withdraws electrons due to its higher electronegativity leading to a higher  oxidation state of the Mo atom at the Mo-edge.
The metallic nature of the Mo-edge and the  excess electrons at the oxygen helps to screen the coulombic interaction in the exciton.
