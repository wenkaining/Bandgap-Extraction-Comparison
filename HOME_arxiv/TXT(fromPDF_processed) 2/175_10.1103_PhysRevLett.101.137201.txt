The effect originates  from spin-dependent screening of the electric field which leads to notable changes in the surface magnetization  and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
These results are of considerable interest in the area of electrically- controlled magnetism and magnetoelectric phenomena.
PACS: 75.80.+q, 75.70.Ak, 77.84.-s, 75.75.+a        The coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic  order parameters in thin-film heterostructures is an exciting  new frontier in nanoscale science.
1 - 5  The underlying  physical phenomenon controlling properties of such  materials is the magnetoelectric (ME) effect 6 , 7  that  determines the induction of magnetization by an electric  field or electric polarization by a magnetic field.
The recent  interest in ME materials is stimulated by their significant  technological potential.
A prominent example is the control  of the ferromagnetic state by an electric field.
8 , 9  This  phenomenon could yield entirely new device concepts, such  as electric field-controlled magnetic data storage.
In a  broader vision, ME effects include not only the coupling  between the electric and magnetic polarizations, but also  related phenomena such as an electrically-controlled  exchange bias,10,   11 and magnetocrystalline anisotropy,12- 14  and the effect of ferroelectricity on spin transport.15- 19   Two mechanisms for the ME effect have been  established: (1) in single-phase ME materials (including  multiferroics) an external electric field displaces ions from  equilibrium positions which changes the magnetostatic and  exchange interactions affecting the magnetization;20 (2) in  composite multiferroic materials, piezoelectric strain in the  ferroelectric constituent of the multiferroic heterostructure  induces changes in the  magnetic properties of the  ferromagnetic constituent due to magnetostriction.9, , 13 14  Recently, two additional mechanisms for magnetoelectricity  have been proposed theoretically: (1) in a heterostructure  comprising a ferroelectric insulator and a magnetic material,  ferroelectric displacements of atoms at the interface may be  reversed by an external electric field resulting in the sizable  change of the interface magnetic moment 21  and surface  (interface) magnetic anisotropy; 22  (2) in the insulator/  ferromagnetic heterostructure, an external electric field  polarizes the insulator resulting in the carrier-mediated  interface magnetoelectricity.23 In this study we explore the ME effect due to the direct  influence of an external electric field on magnetic properties  of ferromagnetic Fe(001), Ni(001) and Co(0001) films.
We  show that spin-dependent screening of the electric field  leads to spin imbalance of the excess surface charge  resulting in notable changes in the surface magnetization  and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
We argue  that the effect may be used to switch the magnetization  between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations, thereby  signifying the potential of electrically-controlled magnetism.
When a metal film is exposed to an electric field, the  conduction electrons screen the electric field over the  screening length of the metal.
In ferromagnetic metals, the  screening charge is spin-dependent due to exchange  interactions.
24 The spin dependence of the screening  electrons leads to the induced surface magnetization of the  ferromagnet, i.e. the ME effect.
Since the electric field does  not penetrate into the bulk of metals and the induced electric  charge is confined to a depth of the order of atomic  dimensions from the surface, this ME effect is limited to the  metal  surface.
Therefore  we  name  it  a  surface  magnetoelectric effect.
In order to elucidate the surface magnetoelectric effect  quantitatively we carry out density-functional calculations  on free-standing ferromagnetic films under the influence of  a uniform electric field applied perpendicular to the film  surface.
The studied systems are bcc Fe(001) (a = 2.87 Å),  hcp Co(0001) (a = 2.51 Å, c/a =1.622), and fcc Ni(001) (a =  3.52 Å) films with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 15  monolayers (MLs).
The calculations are based on the  projector augmented wave (PAW) method implemented in  the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) 25  and  include spin-orbit interactions.
The exchange-correlation  potential  is  treated  in  the  generalized  gradient  approximation (GGA).
We use the energy cut-off of 500 eV  for the plane wave expansion of the PAWs and a 10 x 10 x 1    1Monkhorst-Pack grid for k-point sampling in the self- consistent calculations.
All the structural relaxations are  performed until the Hellman-Feynman forces on the relaxed  atoms become less than 1 meV/Å. The external electric field  is introduced by planar dipole layer method.26   -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 3.06 3.08 3.10 3.12 M agnetic M om ent (μΒ) Electric Field (V/Å ) M  || [001]  M  || [100]         FIG.

The solid lines are a linear fit to the calculated  data.
Results of our calculations demonstrate that magnetic  moments do change under applied electric field.
As  expected, the magnetoelectric effect is almost solely a  surface effect and has little dependence on film thickness.
Fig. 1 shows  the calculated magnetic moment on the  surface Fe atom of a free-standing 15-ML Fe (001) film as a  function of an applied electric field for magnetization lying  in the plane of the film ([100] direction) and perpendicular  to the plane ([001] direction).
The spin and orbital  contributions to the total moment are of the order of 3.0 and  0.1 μB respectively.
It is seen that the magnetic moment  changes nearly linearly with the electric field, so that the  induced surface magnetization ∆M depends on the applied  electric field E as follows:    0 μ α Δ = S M E ,  (1)  where αS denotes the surface magnetoelectric coefficient.
Here a positive electric field is defined to be pointed away  from the metal film surface.
Therefore results for both  positive and negative electric fields are obtained at two  surfaces within one simulation.
From the linear fit to the  calculated data shown in Fig. 1 we find that for  magnetization in the plane  100 αS  ≈ 2.4 × 10-14 Gcm2/V and  for magnetization perpendicular to the plane  001 αS ≈ 2.9 ×  10-14 Gcm2/V.
The vertical separation between the two lines  in Fig. 1 for a given applied electric field is the difference in  the orbital moments in the two magnetization directions (as  shown later in Fig. 4) because the corresponding spin  moments are essentially the same.

The applied external  electric field is E = 1.0 V/Å, pointing from right to left.
The origin of this ME effect stems from induced spin- dependent charge densities on the surfaces of the film.
Fig. 2 displays the differences in the charge densities between  the disturbed (E = 1.0 V/Å) and undisturbed (E = 0) Fe film.
It is seen that the surface dipoles are formed to screen the  electric field inside the film and the induced charge density  is strongly spin-polarized.
We note the presence of the  Friedel-like oscillation of the change density in Fig. 2,  which is typical for the electron screening effect.27 However,  unlike the case of normal metals, the charge oscillations  have multiple periods, and the oscillations of the majority-  and minority-spin electrons are different.
This is because the  majority- and minority-spin electrons have different Fermi  wave vectors, and they are coupled in the dielectric  response.24 Due to the spin imbalance of the screening charge, there  is an induced surface magnetization reflecting the presence  of the surface ME effect.
Fig. 3 visualizes the induced spin  density across the Fe film.
It is clearly seen that the ME  effect is confined to the surfaces of the film.
The net  induced spin densities at the two opposite surfaces have  different signs, as the applied electric fields are oppositely  oriented with respect to the two surfaces of the film.
It is interesting to compare the calculated magnitude of  the surface ME coefficient due to the direct influence of an  external electric field with those predicted earlier for  BaTiO3/Fe  and SrTiO3/SrRuO3 structures.
In the later case,  the ME effect originates from the capacitive accumulation  of spin-polarized carriers at the SrTiO3/SrRuO3 interface  under an external electric field.
The calculations of ref.
23  suggest that for a 7 unit cell thick SrTiO3 (a = 3.904 Å)  layer the applied voltage of 27.8 mV induces a net magnetic  moment of 2.5×10-3 μB per surface unit cell.
The  corresponding surface ME coefficient is αS ≈ 2×10-12  Gcm2/ V.
This value is higher by two orders of magnitude    2than what we obtained for Fe film.
This difference is related  to the dielectric constant of the dielectric at the  dielectric/metal interface.
For a given applied electric field,  the screening charge in the metal is proportional to the  dielectric constant. According to ref.
17, SrTiO3 has a very  large dielectric constant, 490 ε ≈ , compared to  1 ε =  in the  present calculations.
Therefore, the presence of a dielectric  with large dielectric constant can significantly amplify the  surface ME effect. FIG.
3 (color online) Induced spin densities, ∆ σ＝σ (E) – σ (0), in arbitrary  units for a 15-ML-thick Fe film (about 21 Å) under the influence of an  electric field of 1 V/Å.    In the case of BaTiO3/Fe structure, the predicted ME  effect occurs as a result of the reversal of the polarization  orientation due to an applied electric field and originates  from the change in the interface bonding strength which  dominates over the screening charge contribution.
This ME  effect is strongly non-linear and does not follow a simple  relation given by Eq. (1).
Nevertheless, to have a crude  estimate of the surface ME coefficient we assume that the  polarization of BaTiO3 can be switched at the coercive field  of Ec = 100 kV/cm resulting in the change of the interface  magnetic moment of more than 0.3 μB per unit surface cell.
We find that the surface ME coefficient is then αs ≈ 2×10-10  Gcm2/ V.
This value is much larger than the electric-field- induced effects discussed above.
Calculations performed for magnetic Co (0001) and Ni  (001) films confirm qualitatively predictions obtained for Fe.
We find that the surface ME coefficients (in units of 10-14  Gcm2/V) are 100 αS  ≈ 1.6,  001 αS ≈ 1.7 for 9-ML Co (0001) film  and  100 αS ≈ 3.0,  001 αS ≈ 2.4 for 9-ML Ni (001) film.
Note that  the predicted surface ME coefficients have the same sign for  the three kinds of metal films.
This is in disagreement with  the prediction of ref.
24 suggesting that Fe film has different  sign of the induced magnetic moment from that in Co and  Ni films.
Obviously a simple free-electron-like model  adopted in ref.
24 is unable to take into account all the  electronic effects which occur in the 3d metals due to the  presence  of  the  exchange-splitting  d  bands,  their  hybridizations with s and p bands, and the difference  between bulk and surface electronic structures.
The origin of the predicted positive ME coefficient for  all the ferromagnetic films can be understood within a  simple model.
The model assumes a localization of the  screening charge within the first atomic ML on the metal  surface and a rigid shift of the chemical potential on the  surface in response to the applied electric field E.
According  to this model the surface charge density σ ε = E  is  unequally distributed between the surface majority- and  minority-spin states resulting in the surface ME coefficient     2 B s n n ec n n εμ α ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ − = − + .
(2)  Here  ↑ n  and   are majority- and minority-spin surface  DOS at the Fermi energy and  ↓ n ε  is the dielectric constant of  the dielectric adjacent to the ferromagnetic surface (in our  case of vacuum 1 ε = ).
As is seen from Eq. (2), αs  is  proportional to the spin polarization of the surface DOS.
It  is known that at the Fe (001), Co(0001) and Ni(001)  surfaces, the minority-spin states are dominant near the  Fermi level.
28 Therefore the accumulation of electrons in  response to the application of an inward (negative) electric  field results in a decrease of the surface spin moment, due to  the dominating minority-spin character at the Fermi energy.
Using Eq.(2) and the calculated surface DOS, we find αS ≈  5.2, 4.9 and 5.5 × 10-14 Gcm2/V  for Fe (001), Co (0001),  and Ni (001) respectively.
These values are in a qualitative  agreement with the results of our density-functional  calculations.
Another important consequence of applying electric  field to the ferromagnetic metal films is the change of their  magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), which may be  considered as another manifestation of the ME effect.
The  MAE, whose physical origin is the spin-orbit coupling, 29  plays an important role in high anisotropy materials used in  modern magnetic storage technologies.30 Recently we have  demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy of the  ferromagnetic film can be altered by switching the  polarization of the adjacent ferroelectric through applied  bias voltage.
The effect occurs due to the change of the  electronic structure at the interface region, which is  produced by ferroelectric displacements and mediated by  interface bonding.
Here we demonstrate the direct impact of  an external electric field on the MAE.
3Following our previous study, we decompose the MAE  for the whole film into individual contributions from each  constituent atom.
By doing this, we find that the MAE  changes for the ferromagnetic film under various electric  fields, again, mainly occur at the surface.
To be specific, an  outward (positive) electric field enhances and an inward  (negative) electric field reduces the individual MAE  contribution from surface atoms.
As is seen from Fig. 4, the  orbital moment anisotropy (ML [001] - ML[100]) of the  surface Fe atoms increases monotonically with the increase  of applied electric field.
This leads to a significant increase  of the surface MAE when the electric field changes from  inward (negative) to outward (positive) direction, evident  from Fig. 4.
In particular, when the electric field of 0.5 V/Å  switches from negative to positive, there is a change of  about 30% in the surface MAE.
The predicted phenomenon can be used for switching  the magnetization by an applied electric field.
The total  magnetic anisotropy energy per unit area of the film  involves the magnetostatic shape anisotropy energy Km = - 2πM2t, where M is the magnetization and t is film thickness.
The shape anisotropy favors in-plane alignment of  magnetization, whereas positive MAE favors out-of-plane  alignment.
Thus, with the ME control of the surface  magnetocrystalline anisotropy and thickness dependent  shape anisotropy, it is possible to design ferromagnetic  films with the anisotropy switchable between in-plane and  out-of-plane orientations.

The predicted ME effects in ferromagnetic metal films  are significant only when the applied field is very large, e.g.,  of a few hundred mV/Å. However, such strong electric  fields could be achieved experimentally using a scanning  tunneling microscope tip over the magnetic metal film  surface.
Since the screening effect can be dramatically  enhanced by high-κ dielectrics, the applied electric field  could be much smaller to have observable effects on the  related devices.
To summarize, our first-principle calculations show that  the surface magnetoelectric effect exists in ferromagnetic  metal films due to spin-dependent screening of electric field  at the metal surfaces.
The external electric field induces  notable changes in the surface magnetization and the surface  magnetocrystalline anisotropy of a ferromagnetic metal.
The  magnitude and sign of the surface magnetoelectric  coefficient depends on the density and spin polarization of  the charge carriers near the Fermi level of the ferromagnetic  metal film.
This purely electric field driven magnetoelectric  effect may be interesting for application in advanced  magnetic and electronic devices.
