arXiv:1406.6197v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall]  24 Jun 2014 Solid argon as a possible substrate for quasi-freestanding silicene S. Sattar1, R. Hoﬀmann2, and U. Schwingenschl¨ogl1,∗ 1PSE Division, KAUST, Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 2Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Baker Laboratory, Ithaca NY 14853-1301 (USA) (Dated: January 12, 2021) We study the structural and electronic properties of silicene on solid Ar(111) substrate using ab-initio calculations.
We demonstrate that due to weak interaction quasi-freestanding silicene is realized in this system.
The small binding energy of only −32 meV per Si atom also indicates the possibility to separate silicene from the solid Ar(111) substrate.
In addition, a band gap of 11 meV and a signiﬁcant splitting of the energy levels due to spin-orbit coupling are observed.
Keywords: silicene, substrate, separation, argon I. INTRODUCTION Silicene is based on a two-dimensional honeycomb Si lattice, similar to graphene, attracting interest by the predicted linear dispersion near the Dirac point and var- ious potential applications in electronic devices.
The structure is not perfectly two-dimensional, but a ﬁnite buckling mixes some sp3 hybridization into the sp2 states.
The weaker Si-Si bonding, as compared to the C-C bond- ing in graphene [1], strongly complicates the synthesis.
Still, silicene has been grown on thin ﬁlm ZrB2, resulting in electronic properties that are diﬀerent from the expec- tations for freestanding samples [2].
Both the buckling and the electronic properties can be modiﬁed by epitax- ial strain, which hints at a strong interaction with the substrate.
Silicene on Ir(111) has been investigated ex- perimentally and theoretically in Ref. [3].
It has been demonstrated that Si nanoribbons can be grown on Ag(110) substratea [4, 5] and the electronic structure has been investigated by angular resolved pho- toelectron spectroscopy [6].
Epitaxial growth with a highly ordered honeycomb structure on Ag(111) has been conﬁrmed by scanning tunneling microscopy [7].
The Si nearest neighbor distance of 1.9±0.1 ˚A, obtained by line analysis of the microscopy data, also points to strong in- teraction with the substrate.
A systematic study of Si superstructures on Ag(111) has been performed in Ref.
9 using low energy electron diﬀraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and ab-initio calculations.
Further results from scanning tunneling microscopy have been reported in Refs.
[10–12], conﬁrming that the quasiparticles in sil- icene behave as massless Dirac fermions.
However, ex- periments indicate that the Dirac nature is perturbed by symmetry breaking due to the substrate [13].
This argu- mentation is supported by ab-initio results, which lack a Dirac dispersion for various stable and metastable struc- tures of silicene on Ag(111) [14, 15].
Graphene has been separated from SiC(0001) sub- strate, on which the binding energy experimentally amounts to 106 meV [16].
As Si bonds are usually weaker ∗udo.schwingenschlogl@kaust.edu.sa, +966(0)544700080 than C bonds, to separate silicene from a substrate prob- ably a signiﬁcantly smaller energy will be necessary.
Hexagonal boron nitride [17] and SiC(0001) [18, 19] are known substrates for graphene and therefore have been studied also for silicene by ab-initio calculations, ﬁnding that the Dirac cone is preserved, though slightly doped in the case of hydrogenated SiC(0001) [20].
For a super- lattice of silicene and hexagonal boron nitride a binding energy of 57 meV per Si atom has been predicted the- oretically [21].
The electronic properties of silicene on II-VI and III-V semiconducting (111) substrates, includ- ing AlAs, AlP, GaAs, GaP, ZnS, and ZnSe have been investigated in some detail [22–24], ﬁnding n-doping on metal terminated and p-doping on non-metal terminated surfaces.
Ar exists as solid at low temperature, with short range, weak, and attractive London dispersion forces responsi- ble for the molecular bonding [25].
The temperature- pressure phase diagram has been studied in Refs.
[26, 27], demonstrating that a face centered cubic structure is sta- ble below a temperature of 84 K. Despite various at- tempts, so far no suitable substrate could be identiﬁed such that the characteristic electronic structure of sil- icene would not be perturbed dramatically on it [28].
This is probably the consequence of too high binding energies on the tested substrates.
For example, values of 89 and 76/84 meV per atom have been reported for hexagonal boron nitride and Si/C-terminated SiC(0001), respectively [20].
In this context, we study the possi- bility of utilizing solid Ar(111) as a substrate and ana- lyze the consequences on the electronic properties of sil- icene.
We will argue that silicene on solid Ar(111) is quasi-freestanding.
In addition, in Refs.
[29, 30] a buﬀer layer of solid noble gas has been used to deposit metal clusters by soft landing and subsequent evaporation of the noble gas.
A similar approach with solid Ar(111) on top of the desired substrate can provide access to growth of silicene on essentially any substrate.2 II.
COMPUTATIONAL METHOD All calculations are performed using density func- tional theory in the generalized gradient approximation (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization) and ultra- soft pseudopotentials, as implemented in the Quantum- ESPRESSO package [31].
The plane wave cutoﬀen- ergy for pure Ar is set to 476 eV and for all other sys- tems to 544 eV. In the self-consistent calculation of pure Ar a Monkhorst-Pack 32 × 32 × 32 k-mesh is employed, whereas for all other systems a 32 × 32 × 1 k-mesh is used.
To achieve a high resolution, dense 64 × 64 × 64 and 64×64×1 k-meshes are used for calculating the den- sity of states (DOS).
An energy convergence of 10−5 Ry and a force convergence of 10−4 Ry/Bohr are achieved.
Calculations are performed with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and with and without van der Waals (vdW) interaction [32].
In the zoomed band structures shown in the following we use δK = (0.002; 0.002; 0) with K = (1/3; 1/3; 0).
We consider a slab geometry with silicene on one side of an Ar(111) slab, which inherits hexagonal symmetry from the two subsystems. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The optimized lattice parameter of solid Ar is 5.36 ˚A, which leads to an Ar-Ar distance of 5.36/ √ 2 ˚A= 3.79 ˚A.
On the other hand, for freestanding silicene we obtain 3.86 ˚A in agreement with Ref. [33].
For the combined argon-silicene (ArSi) system we set the lattice parameter to 3.79 ˚A, i.e., silicene is subject to a lattice mismatch of 1.9%.
Figure 1 shows for the ArSi system a buckling of 0.53 ˚A (distance between the bottom and top atomic layers), which is slightly higher than predicted for free- standing silicene (0.46 ˚A) in Ref. [34].
We note that an artiﬁcially planarized structure with the same Si-Si bond length as the ground state buckled structure is only 32 meV per Si atom higher in energy.
The Ar(111) sub- strate consists of six Ar layers.
The top layer is arranged such that two thirds of the atoms are located below Si atoms and the last third is located below the center of a Si hexagon, which turns out to minimize the energy. Si Ar FIG. 1.

3. Band structure and DOS of silicene without vdW interaction (no band gap without SOC and Eg = 2 meV with SOC).
After structural optimization without vdW interaction, the Si-Si bond length is 2.27 ˚A with a bond angle of 115◦, in agreement with Refs. [34–36].
We obtain a distance of 4.3 ˚A between the top Ar layer and the silicene, whereas the interlayer spacing in the substrate amounts to 3.6 ˚A. Taking into account the vdW interaction, we obtain the same buckling but reduced interlayer spacings of 3.4 ˚A and 3.1 ˚A, respectively.
The band structure and DOS of solid Ar are shown in Fig. 2 and those of freestanding silicene in Fig. 3. With- out SOC we obtain for silicene the characteristic linear dispersion of the π and π∗bands around the K point [1], reﬂecting massless Dirac fermions.
The inclusion of SOC opens a band gap of 2 meV, which is small, but much larger than in the case of graphene (due to the stronger SOC) and agrees with Refs. [21, 36].
When we turn on the vdW interaction we obtain virtually identical results3 Γ K M Γ -12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 E-EF (eV) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 DOS (1/eV) without SOC with SOC K K-δΚ K+δΚ -0.01 -0.005 0 0.005 0.01 Γ K M Γ -12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 E-EF (eV) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 DOS (1/eV) K K-δΚ K+δΚ -0.01 -0.005 0 0.005 0.01 FIG.

to Fig. 3 both without and with SOC.
For the combined ArSi system the band structure and DOS are presented in Fig. 4.
Without vdW interaction and without SOC we obtain again a band gap of 2 meV, indicating minor inﬂuence of the substrate despite the fact that the interlayer spacing between Ar and Si is large.
SOC splits the bands near the K point, one form- ing a perfect Dirac cone and one showing a band gap of 2 meV.
We note that the band gap of silicene can be tuned by applying an external electric ﬁeld, because the insulating Ar does not screen electric ﬁelds.
The binding energy (EArSi−EAr−ESi)/2 per Si atom between silicene and the substrate amounts to −3 meV, both without and with SOC.
Switching on the vdW interaction enhances the band gap to 11 meV without and 10 meV with SOC.
This is much larger than in graphene but for many poten- tial device applications still too small.
For example, for metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors a size- able band gap is required for a good on-oﬀratio and low power dissipation [37].
If SOC is included, both split bands show energy gaps, where the splitting at the K point is of similar magnitude as seen in the top part of Fig. 4.
The larger band gap reﬂects the relevance of the vdW interaction in the hybrid system, in contrast to freestanding silicene, while SOC splits the bands near the Fermi level.
The binding energy per Si atom accord- ingly is enhanced to −32 meV, which, however, is still very small.
In particular, it is much less than reported for silicene on inert hexagonal boron nitride [21].
Due to the weak interaction, we conclude that solid Ar(111) will support quasi-freestanding silicene.
IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have discussed the structure and elec- tronic properties of silicene on solid Ar(111).
It turns out to be critical to take into account the vdW interaction to obtain realistic results.
We have shown that the Dirac cone of freestanding silicene remains intact on Ar(111), which points to a weak interaction with the substrate.
In fact, we obtain for the binding energy a small value of −32 meV per Si atom, indicating a quasi-freestanding nature of silicene on Ar(111).
Any other substrate em- ployed so far has resulted in fundamental perturbations of the Dirac states, which is not the case on solid Ar ac- cording to our simulations.
It is likely that separation of silicene from this substrate is possible.
