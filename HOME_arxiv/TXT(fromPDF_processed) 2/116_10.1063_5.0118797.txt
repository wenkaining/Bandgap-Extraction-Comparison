The important question emerges about the microscopic origin of this crossover and the generalizibility to other glass-formers.
In this work, the fragile-to-strong crossover of a model 2D glassy system is analyzed via molecular dynamics simulation, which represents 2D-silica.
By separating the sampled defect and defect-free inherent structures, we are able to identify their respective density of states distributions with respect to energy.
A low energy cutoff is found in both distributions.
It is shown that the fragile-to-strong crossover can be quantitatively related to the parameters of the energy landscape, involving in particular the low-energy cutoff of the energy distribution.
It is also shown that the low-energy cutoff of the defect-states is determined by the formation energy of a speciﬁc defect conﬁguration, involving two silicon and no oxygen defect.
The low-temperature behavior of 2D silica is quantitatively compared with that of 3D silica, showing surprisingly similar behavior.
Keywords: Silica co-ordination defects, Fragile to strong crossover, Two-dimensional silica I. INTRODUCTION The origin of the anomalous temperature dependence of viscosity is a matter of debate for glassy systems.
In gen- eral, the dynamical behavior of the glassy systems can be de- scribed either as ‘Strong’ or ‘Fragile’, depending on the na- ture of the relationship between the viscosity (η) and tem- perature (T); i.e. the Angell plot1 (ln(η(T)) vs β, where β = 1/KBT).
Assuming the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation2, one can represent η(T) ∝1/D(T), where D(T) rep- resents the diffusivity of the ﬂuid.
The strong glasses obey the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the diffusion constant, i.e. D(T) ∝exp(−βV0), where V0 is the average ac- tivation energy of the ﬂuid.
In contrast, the dynamics of the fragile glasses are usually described with the empirical Vo- gel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation3–6 D(T) ∝exp  α T −T0  (1) where α, and T0 are empirical constants.
Experimentally, it has been shown that, several compounds undergo a Fragile- to-Strong crossover (FSC) at a certain temperature range7–13, which is usually close to the glass transition temperature.
In- terestingly, molecules with tetrahedral ordering show a gen- eral tendency for such behavior in the bulk state13–16.
The fragile behavior of glasses at high temperatures–i.e. the power-law behavior of the relaxation time–can be explained a)https://www.uni-muenster.de/Chemie.pc/en/forschung/heuer/index.html with the help of mode-coupling theory17,18.
Upon cooling, the transition to Arrhenius behavior is often correlated with a supposed liquid-liquid phase transition, which generally oc- curs in the super-cooled region19–24.
However, a proper phys- ical mechanism for FSC–at either bulk or molecular level–is not well understood.
Potential energy landscape (PEL) anal- ysis of the glassy systems provides a good understanding of the FSC phenomenon at low temperatures.
It is known that, below the mode-coupling temperature, the dynamics and the thermodynamics of the system start to correlate, and the na- ture of the dynamical properties strongly reﬂect the properties of the PEL.
In this region, the nature of the PEL can be de- scribed by the properties of the underlying minima, i.e. In- herent States (IS)25–32.
At higher temperatures, the fragile be- havior can be linked to the multiplicity and the width of the underlying IS-energy distributions33,34.
With decreasing tem- perature, the conﬁgurational entropy of the system (Sc) de- creases, and the widths of the basins in the PEL landscape become narrower.
Following the Adam-Gibbs theory35, one can determine the relaxation time and subsequently the diffu- sivity as a function of the Sc in the low-temperature region as D(T) ∝exp(−B/TSc), where B is a constant.
Therefore, if Sc is independent of temperature36–38, a transition from frag- ile to strong behavior can be related to an inﬂection in Sc.
Using molecular dynamics simulations, Saksaengwijit et al.39 had shown that in case of BKS-silica40, there exists a cutoff in the density of states (DOS) distribution of IS’s at a certain en- ergy.
The presence of such a cutoff prevents Sc from vanishing at low temperatures and thus avoids the Kauzmann paradox.
However, determination of the nature of reduction of Sc at low temperature is a difﬁcult task in simulation as it is computa- tionally demanding41,42.
Thus, proper calculation of the FSC arXiv:2208.01011v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn]  14 Oct 20222 temperature from the IS analysis remains challenging.
The microscopic origin of FSC varies from system to sys- tem.
Poly-amorphism38 was often suspected to be the drive behind the FSC phenomenon.
For example, a two-state model was proposed by Tanaka et al.43–45 to explain the viscosity anomaly of water.
In this model, two different conﬁgura- tions of locally favored small clusters of water molecules con- trols the bulk properties of water.
The FSC in water can thus be explained from the population ratio of such clus- ters, both of which separately follow Arrhenius type temper- ature dependence of viscosity.
This model predicts a smooth crossover from the fragile to the strong regime, and was able to predict the crossover temperature, TFSC, quite well44,45.
In case of several tetrahedrally ordered halide-molecules13; e.g. ZnCl212,46, BeF210,46, GeSe247–49; the reduction of the Sc near FSC has also been correlated to the changes in the ordering of the local environment.
For these materials, in both experi- ment12,46,49 and simulation50,51, a sharp change has been ob- served in the ratio of the local edge-sharing tetrahedral order- ing to entropically favored corner-sharing tetrahedral order- ing, with lowering temperature in the vicinity of FSC.
These results clearly indicate that FSC is linked to the speciﬁc mi- croscopic environment of the ﬂuid.
Recently a continuum model, in conjugation to the two-state theory, is proposed to explain the non-Arrhenius behavior of the liquids using non- linear Fokker-Plank equations52,53.
Despite the similarity between the molecular structure (tetrahedral) of water and silica, they exhibit several differ- ences in terms of cluster formation54.
While the structure of the water-clusters are controlled by the hydrogen-bond net- work, silica-clusters are controlled by the ﬂexibility of the bridging-oxygen bonds.
As a result, although water and sil- ica exhibits some dynamical and thermodynamical similarity– e.g. density anomaly, FSC, etc.–their microscopic origin can be somewhat different.
Saksaengwijit et al.39 had postulated that for BKS-silica40, the FSC can be related to a decrease in the fraction of coordination defects.
As the temperature of the system is lowered, the fraction of the coordination defects in silica decreases.
Recently, using replica exchange molec- ular dynamics, Yu et al.41 have shown that the rate of such a decrease shows a sharp increase near its ﬁctive temperature.
Thus, near the cutoff, one can postulate that the defect states would completely disappear.
This, in turn, should result in an arrest in the hopping dynamics of silica as the effective ac- tivation energy for the bond-breaking process would be very large39,55.
In this paper, we study the FSC behavior of a 2D model system which represents an allotrope of silica, namely the two-dimensional silica56 (2D-silica).
This material is an ideal member to study the properties of a natural glass forming system with computer simulation since an atomistic scale de- scription of the real structure is available directly from the ex- periment.
2D-silica is grown on Ru57 or Graphene surfaces58 via vapor deposition and in-situ oxidation.
The binding of 2D-silica with the underlying surface is quite weak which makes it a free-standing material59.
However, the material is extremely thin with a height of just ∼3 atoms in the Z- direction57.
Therefore, measuring high temperature properties of this material is quite difﬁcult as it would desorb from the surface during heating.
Thus, for this system the FSC behav- ior is expected to be inaccessible via experiments.
Therefore, computer simulations play an important role to elucidate the properties of this system close to the FSC.
The objective of this paper is to show that the PEL descrip- tion of the dynamical behavior works well for the descrip- tion of FSC in the 2D-silica model.
Similar to the BKS-silica model, we aim to correlate the presence of a cutoff in the PEL with the FSC phenomenon in 2D-silica.
We provide further insight into the microscopic environment of 2D-silica near the FSC in terms of the coordination defects.
The paper is orga- nized as follows.
We start with a short account of the methods in section II and analyze the density of states (DOS) distribu- tions.
In section III, we study the changes in the PEL inﬂu- enced by the coordination defects and explicitly show that the FSC is related to the cutoff in the PEL.
Afterwards, we show in section IV that a speciﬁc local arrangement of the particles is present at the low energy limit which is independent of the system size, thus yielding insight into the structural and en- ergetic properties of the defects.
We ﬁnish with a conclusion and outlook.
II. METHODS A. Simulation In our previous works60–62, we have used a Yukawa type force-ﬁeld to describe the structural and thermodynamical properties of 2D-silica in close similarity with the experimen- tal results, which reads Vij(rij) = "σij rij 12 + qij rij  exp(−κrij) # (2) For details of the simulation parameters, we refer to the ref- erence 60.
With a 80 particle system in a square box of side length 19.67 Å, we performed a molecular dynamics simu- lation under NVT conditions for a wide range of tempera- tures using Nosé-Hoover chains thermostat63,64, and an ele- mentary timestep of 0.01.
We sample the inherent structures and their energies (EIS) by quenching the trajectory with a frequency of 100 steps.
Except for the mean square displace- ment (MSD) calculations, we use the minimized structures for analysis throughout the paper.
B. Defects In our analysis, we separate the IS’s based on the coordina- tion defects.
We denote an IS as a defect-free-state (abbrevi- ation: df), if all Si particles have 3 O particles and all O par- ticles have 2 Si particles within an empirical cutoff distance of 2.0 Å. Otherwise the IS is termed as defect-state (abbrevi- ation: d).
The choice of this cutoff is based on the gSi-O(r) analysis60, which showed a sharp peak around 1.5-1.6 Å at3 the low energy regime.
Since we are interested in the struc- tural features of the model at low temperatures, the choice of the distance cutoff is sufﬁcient in identifying any coordination defects in the structure.
C. Reweighting With the sampled IS structures at one given temperature, one can calculate the DOS (G(EIS)) at different energies.
This calculation is performed by binning the distribution of inher- ent structures P(EIS,T) and reweighting the resulting energy distribution with an inverse Boltzmann factor, i.e. G(EIS) ∝P(EIS,T)eβEIS (3) Naturally, one unknown energy-independent proportional- ity constant remains.
Similarly, one can deﬁne Gd(EIS) and Gdf(EIS) as the DOS of the defect-states and defect-free- states, respectively.
We note that this relation, i.e. the esti- mation of a temperature independent DOS, is valid as long as anharmonic effects in the vibrations within an IS are not too strong32,65.
Strictly speaking the DOS should be rather inter- preted as an effective DOS because each state is also weighted by the harmonic partition function, i.e by the inverse square root of the frequency32.
It is known that the DOS distribution of a binary Lennard-Jones liquid or BKS-silica has a Gaussian shape over a large energy range65–67.
To determine G(EIS) over a broad energy range, based on the Boltzmann distributions from different temperatures, one could try to overlap the different G(EIS)-curves, obtained from different temperatures.
A procedure to obtain the DOS in a statistically optimized way is the Weighted Histogram Anal- ysis Method (WHAM)68.
To obtain the DOS G(EIS) we use the algorithm developed by Gallicchio et al.69 which reads for the present application G(EIS) = ∑i N(EIS,Ti) ∑i Ni(Ti)fi(Ti)ci(EIS,Ti) (4) Here, N(EIS,Ti) is the total counts of the states at energy bin EIS at temperature Ti and N(Ti) = ∑j N(E j IS,Ti).
ci(EIS,Ti) is called a component of the biasing matrix, which is calculated as ci(EIS,Ti) = exp[−βiEIS] From there, one can optimize the normalization factor fi(Ti) as f −1 i (Ti) = ∑ j ci(E j IS,Ti)G(E j IS,Ti) We iteratively optimize the normalization factor fi(Ti) until convergence is reached and the DOS can be read off.
Note that the resulting DOS is deﬁned except for one proportionality constant.
In analogy this procedure can be applied as well for the determination of Gd(EIS) and Gdf(EIS).
However, due to the unknown proportionality constants we would not be able to determine, e.g., the fraction of defect-free-states qdf(EIS) at a given energy EIS.
Naturally, from equilibrium simulations at a given temperature Ti one can directly read of this fraction qi df(EIS,Ti).
Since this fraction is an equilibrium property, in the limit of inﬁnite sampling it would not depend on tempera- ture.
In the spirit of WHAM we join the information from the simulations at the different temperatures for the estimation of qdf(EIS) via qdf(EIS) = ∑i N(EIS,Ti)qi df(EIS,Ti) ∑i N(EIS,Ti) (5) In practice we ﬁrst determine G(EIS) (via WHAM) and qdf(EIS) as described above and then estimate the DOS for the defect-free-states and defect-states, respectively, via Gdf(EIS) = G(EIS)qdf(EIS) Gd(EIS) = G(EIS)(1−qdf(EIS)) (6) III.
PEL PROPERTIES AND THEIR RELATION TO THE DIFFUSIVITY In this section, we investigate the DOS distributions of de- fect and defect-free states with energy using the WHAM op- timized energy distributions in the previous section.
All im- portant parameters, to be discussed below, are summarized in Table I. TABLE I. Values of the important variables used in section III.
For the description of the variables, see main text and supporting material (SM).
Ecutoff df (Figure 1(c)) -27.04 Ecutoff d (Figure 1(c)) -26.93 Ecross 0 (Figure 1(c)) -26.86 Emax IS (Figure SM.1(a)) -25.77 Emax d (Figure 1(b)) -25.89 Emax df (Figure 1(c)) -26.56 sIS (Figure SM.1(a)) 0.12 sd (Figure 1(b)) 0.12 sdf (Figure 1(c)) 0.07 V0 (Figure 2(a)) 0.26 A. Density of states In Figure 1(a) we show the Boltzmann distribution pd(EIS,T) of defect-states for a large range of temperatures.
Whereas for the highest temperature (curve at the right end) the distribution is basically Gaussian, one observes for lower temperatures deviations from the Gaussian shape in the low- energy range and the presence of a cutoff-energy of Ecutoff d = −26.93.
This value does not seem to depend on temperature.4 FIG.
1. (a) The semi-log plot for the normalized Boltzmann distributions of the defect-states for temperatures between T=0.014 and T=0.018.
One can estimate the cutoff energies for the defect-states at ∼-26.93.
(b) DOS of defect-states, obtained from the data in (a) via Boltzmann reweighting.
The data at T=0.015 are ﬁtted with a Gaussian function lnG(E) = −1 2[(E −Emax d )/s]2 +cd(T) with Emax d = −25.89,sd = 0.12 and an arbitrary shift parameters cd(T).
(c) DOS of defect-free states, obtained is a similar way as (b) with Emax df = −26.56,sdf = 0.07.
(d) The plot for the estimated DOS from the WHAM analysis for defect-states, defect-free-states, and all states.
The total DOS curve (marked as Total) is slightly shifted along the Y-axis for better visual inspection.
The fraction of defect-free states at each energy level (qdf(EIS)) is also shown and its values are related to the right Y-axis.
For a complete list of different parameters, see Table I.
In the next step, we reconstructed the underlying DOS via simple reweighting (see Figure 1(b)).
Indeed, we ﬁnd that over a large range of energies DOS curves overlap with each other, which conﬁrmed that the simulations at the lowest tem- peratures have been done at equilibrium.
Similar observation can be made for the total DOS and the defect-free DOS as well (see supporting material, Figure SM.1).
In the high en- ergy range, the DOS seems to depend on temperature.
As mentioned above, this indicates the presence of signiﬁcant an- harmonic effects for high temperatures.
For a large range of energies the distribution follows a Gaussian shape.
Impor- tantly, in the low-energy range the DOS of defect-states de- cays much faster than a Gaussian distribution, reﬂecting the presence of the cutoff-energy.
The analogous results for the defect-free-states are shown in Figure 1(c) (see also support- ing material Figure SM.1(a), for DOS of all-states).
Finally, in Figure 1(d) we show the results of the WHAM analysis, i.e. the DOS G(EIS), GdIS), Gdf(EIS), as well as the fraction of defect-free-states qdf(EIS).
Note that the relevant energy regime, shown in this ﬁgure, only covers the regime where the determination of the DOS is not hampered by anharmonic effects.
Also for the defect-free-states we ﬁnd a low-energy cutoff.
The estimated cutoff energy of the defect-free-states, Ecutoff df ≈−27.04 is signiﬁcantly lower than Ecutoff d , namely ∆Ecutoff = Ecutoff d −Ecutoff df ∼0.11.
As a consequence, also the overall DOS G(EIS) displays the same cutoff as Gd(EIS).
Such a cutoff-energy was also observed in case of BKS- silica39.
Interestingly, ∆Ecutoff hardly changes when increasing the system size from 80 to 200 particles (∆Ecutoff(N = 200) ∼ 0.12 as can be derived from the data in supporting material Figure SM.2).
This result suggests that the minimal number of particles, required to create a defect state, is independent of size.
Later we will show that the structure of the defect-states at the cutoff energy involves a well-deﬁned local environment, other than the usual trigonal geometry so that the energy of 0.11 can be interpreted as a minimum defect formation en- ergy.
Furthermore, Ecutoff df /N hardly varies with system size.5 Thus the energy of the lowest energy state, which is a defect- free state, is an extensive property.
Due to the local character of the formation of a defect it is expected that ∆Ecutoff is not extensive.
This is indeed clearly seen in supporting material Figure SM.2.
Finally, we discuss the properties of the fraction of defect- free-states qdf(EIS).
It has an asymmetric behavior: whereas at low energies one observes a sharp cutoff, below which only defect-free-states are available, at high temperatures there is a more gradual approach towards the limit where only defect- states are present.
Indeed, as seen from the supporting ma- terial (Figure SM.1), there is no indication of a strict cutoff- energy at high energies, although defect-free-states become exponentially rare.
Nevertheless, there is a fast transition from the energy regime governed by defect-free-states to the regime governed by defect-states.
In fact, it takes an energy variation of less than 0.06 to change between qdf(EIS) = 0.2 and qdf(EIS) = 0.8.
The crossover energy, Ecross 0 , where qdf(EIS) = 0.5, i.e. where the number of defect-free-states and defect-states is identical, turns out to be -26.86.
In terms of per-particle energies, the value of Ecross 0 gets lower for a larger system size, see the supporting material (Figure SM.2).
This is because the probability of ﬁnding defect-free-states de- creases exponentially with increasing system size60.
This is a consequence of the fact that a large system can be decomposed into approximately independent smaller subsystems.
Then it becomes very unlikely that the total system contains no defect because this requires that every subsystem is defect-free.
This underlines the importance of studying a smaller system sizes where the statistical characterization of defect-free-states is far easier.
B. Fragile to strong crossover Next we explore a possible relation between the kinet- ics and the thermodynamics of the system.
In Figure 2(a) we show the temperature-dependent diffusion constant.
One clearly ﬁnds a transition from non-Arrhenius to simple Arrhe- nius behavior, D(T) = D0 exp[−V0β], (7) i.e. a transition from fragile to strong behavior.
We have added ﬁts with the VFT equation in the high-temperature and an Ar- rhenius ﬁt in the low-temperature regime.
Starting from the VFT ﬁt, the ﬁrst signiﬁcant deviation is seen for β ≈80.
To relate the kinetics to the thermodynamics of the sys- tem, we provide the average IS energy (Eav IS(T) in Figure 2(b).
Again, two temperature regimes can be observed.
Both have a simple interpretation.
If the DOS is governed by a Gaussian distribution with variance s2 one expects a linear behavior Eav IS(T) = Emax IS −βs2.
(8) Indeed, this is seen in the high-temperature regime in Fig- ure 2(b).
The negative slope of 0.013 is very close to the result of the Gaussian ﬁt (s2 = 0.014), reported in Table I.
Naturally, in the low-temperature regime the average energy starts to ap- proach the cutoff-energy.
Most importantly, the impact of the cutoff-energy again starts to be visible around β ≈80 which is exactly the same temperature regime as observed for the FSC.
This strongly suggests a direct causal relation between the ki- netics and the thermodynamics.
We mention in passing that the crossover temperature can be estimated from the condition Eav IS(T) ≈Ecutoff df +s. The second summand expresses the fact that the energy-cutoff starts to matter as soon as the cutoff is within a standard deviation to the average energy (in Gaussian approximation).
Using the values s = 0.12,Emax IS = −25.77 (see supporting material, Figure SM.1), and Ecutoff df = −27.04, one obtains β = 79.8 which is basically identical to the esti- mated crossover temperature of β ≈80.
C. Comparison with bulk silica Previously, FSC has been observed also for 3D bulk silica– simulated with the standard BKS forceﬁeld39–and related to the properties of the energy landscape.
In this way, the causal- ity could be directly proven55.
Here we perform a quantitative comparison of the FSC in order to identify similarities and differences between 2D silica and 3D silica.
However, before starting we estimate the crossover temperature for 3D (s = 3.5 eV, Emax IS = −1867 eV, and Ecutoff df = −1910.7 eV) as T = 0.30 eV ≈3500 K which agrees very well with the emergence of the crossover behavior of the diffusivity and the average en- ergy, reported in reference 39.
(i) System size: For the estimation of the diffusivity one can deﬁne an energy-dependent activation energy Eeff(EIS)55 which for 3D silica can be written to a very good approximation as (for EIS ≥Ecutoff df ) Eeff(EIS) ≈λ(Ecutoff df −EIS)+V0(Ecutoff df ).
(9) More generally, the possibility to formulate a relation between activation energy and IS energy (strictly speak- ing metabasin energy, which, however, for the typically visited IS at low temperatures is basically identical) shows the generally strong connection between the dy- namic properties and the nature of the PEL for glass- forming systems30,65,70,71.
The value λ ≤1 has a sim- ple interpretation: λ ×N is the size of the hypothetical elementary subsystem to which relaxation processes are basically conﬁned.
Indeed it has been shown32 that by doubling the system size the value of λ decreases by a factor of 2.
From the data in reference 55 one can esti- mate λ ≈0.6.
Thus, for the system size of N = 99, used for the simulation of bulk silica, an elementary system comprises approx. 60 particles.
For the present case we have no direct information for the estimation of λ.
However, we can formulate an up- per bound.
Naturally, for the highest temperature where anharmonic effects do not matter (β ≈60) one still has activated behavior, i.e. Eeff(Eav IS(β = 60)) ≳0. This6 FIG.
2. (a) Dependence of ln(1/D) on inverse temperature.
The data in the fragile-regime (region marked in red) are ﬁtted with the VFT equation (equation 1) and data in the strong-regime (region marked in gray) are ﬁtted with an Arrhenius equation (equation 7).
Values of α, and T0 are ≈0.014, and 0.011, respectively.
The value of V0 is ≈0.26.
Data inside the mixed regime are not ﬁtted using any equations, but the approximations from both fragile and strong regime are extrapolated to measure βFSC.
(b) Dependence of the average IS energy on the inverse temperature.
A linear ﬁt is performed between 62.5 ≤β ≤77 with slope ∼−0.013.
The cutoff energy for the total system (same as for the defect-free-states, Ecut df ) and defect states (Ecut d ) are also shown as horizontal lines.
implies (using V0(Ecutoff df ) = 0.26, see Figure 2(a), and Eav IS(β = 60) = −26.69) that λ ≤0.74.
Thus, the hy- pothetical elementary subsystem has a size of less than 0.74×80 ≈60 particles.
(ii) PEL landscape: A natural dimensionless number, char- acterizing the shape of the DOS, is given by [Emax IS − Ecutoff df )]/s.
It expresses the impact of the cutoff-energy relative to the overall shape of the Gaussian.
In the present case we have (-25.77 + 27.04)/0.12 = 10.6.
Reading off the corresponding values for bulk silica from reference 39, we obtain (-1867 eV + 1910.7 eV)/3.5 eV = 12.5.
However, for a direct comparison we need to take into account that these ratios depend on system size.
Whereas the energies in the numerator scale with the system size, the standard deviation in the denominator scales with the square root of the system size.
For a fair comparison the values should be evalu- ated for the respective elementary system sizes.
How- ever, that with the present data it cannot be excluded that the elementary system sizes are comparable, the same holds for the shape of the DOS.
(iii) Defect-states vs. defect-free-states: One may ask for the energy to generate defects.
In the present case it is given by ∆Ecutoff ≈0.11.
To obtain an appropri- ate dimensionless number we may relate this value to the crossover temperature, yielding (0.11/(1/80)) ≈ 8.8.
Interestingly, for bulk silica there exist defect- states very close to the cutoff-energy of defect-free- states.
From the data in reference 39 one may estimate ∆Ecutoff 3D ≈1.0 eV. This yields a ratio of (1 eV/0.3 eV) = 3.3 which is signiﬁcantly smaller than 8.8.
One may speculate that in 3D there exist more degrees of free- dom so that defects with (relatively) lower energy costs can be generated.
(iv) Activation energy: We represent activation energy as a ratio of the low-temperature activation energy to the crossover temperature, which makes it a dimensionless number and independent of the system size.
Whereas for the 2D system we have a ratio of (0.26/(1/80)) ≈ 21, the corresponding ratio for the 3D system reads (data taken from reference 39) (4.84 eV / 0.30 eV) ≈ 16.
Thus, the effective barriers for the relaxation pro- cesses agree relatively well.
The remaining differences may be related to a similar argument as in (iii) that in 3D there are more degrees of freedom which allow the system to explore more energy-efﬁcient paths. IV.
STRUCTURAL ASPECTS In the low-temperature limit, where the system mainly re- sides close to the low-energy cutoff of defect-free states, the residual transitions between different defect-free states natu- rally involve the transient population defect states.
This is sup- ported by the observation that the low-temperature activation energy of 0.26 is signiﬁcantly large than the difference in the cutoff energies of the states with and without defects.
Further- more, the deviations from the linear energy dependence vs. in-7 verse temperature, expected for a Gaussian glass-former, start around the cutoff energy of defect states.
For this purpose, we continue with the discussion of the structural properties of defect states, in particular close to their low-energy cutoff.
A. Ring statistics We start by studying the statistics of ring sizes as a func- tion of energy.
We found in Figure 3(a) that with increasing temperature, the probability of ﬁnding 5,6, and 7 rings de- creases, whereas for all other rings it increases.
It is an ex- pected behavior, since large (> ringsize 7) and small (< ring- size 5) rings are quite strained and hence have higher ener- gies61,62.
In Figure 3(b) we show the standard deviation of the ring distribution.
As expected in thermodynamic equilib- rium, at given energy the standard deviation does not depend on temperature within statistical uncertainties.
One observes a different dependence on energy when crossing the crossover energy Ecross 0 .
B. Energy-dependent defect properties To examine the properties of the defect-states in the low- energy limit, we sort the defect-states according to the number of defect-Si particles, denoted dSi.
Here, we do not distinguish whether a defect-Si particle has more or less than 3 O neigh- bors.
The probabilities to ﬁnd a speciﬁc number of defect-Si particles at a given energy are shown in Figure 4(a).
Clearly, the silicon defect states exactly disappear at Ecutoff d .
Again, the data are obtained from averaging over all temperatures, in analogy to Equation 5.
Actually, the average number of defect-Si particles linearly increases with energy above Ecutoff d (see supporting material, Figure SM.3).
Similar to the obser- vation of Yu et al41 in BKS-silica, we ﬁnd that the slope of the number of defect particles vs. energy decreases with increas- ing energy.
After excluding dSi = 0 states, the appropriately renormalized data are shown in Figure 5(a).
We ﬁnd that very close to Ecutoff d , all defect-states have two silicon defects, i.e. dSi = 2.
In particular, there are no defect states with just one silicon defect.
They only start to appear at slightly higher en- ergies.
This is also reﬂected in the anomalous behavior of the average number of defects (excluding dSi = 0 states), shown in the supporting material Figure SM.3.
Analogously, we study the properties of oxygen defects.
In Figure 4(b), the probabilities to ﬁnd a speciﬁc number of defect-O particles are shown.
We ﬁnd that already above Ecutoff d no oxygen defects are present.
Thus, there exists an energy range where two silicon defects are present but no oxygen defect (see below for a closer characterization of that state).
For states slightly above Ecutoff d , in average two defect- Si but no defect-O particles are present.
The structures of the dSi = 2 defect states are further ana- lyzed by counting different Si-O co-ordinations (CSi-O) of the participating defect-Si particles (i, j), such as, Ci Si-O = 1 and C j Si-O = 4 (abbreviation: 1-4 defect); (Ci Si-O = 2 and C j Si-O = 2 (abbreviation: 2-2 defect);Ci Si-O = 2 and C j Si-O = 4 (abbrevia- tion: 2-4 defect).
As shown in Figure 5(b), near Ecutoff d only 2-4 defect states are observed.
Performing a similar analysis for dSi = 1 states, we ﬁnd that only CSi-O = 2 co-ordination is present for the single defect-Si particle at all energies.
We ﬁnd that such a Si-O co-ordination for dSi = 1 states is not possible with dO = 0 but with dO = 1, as by deﬁnition co- ordination numbers of the Si and O particles are dependent on each other.
Performing a similar co-ordination number analy- sis to only dO = 1 states, we ﬁnd that corresponding CO-Si is strictly 1 within our simulation set up.
Next, we analyze the spatial correlations in between the defect-Si particles in each frame by calculating the average distance between them in dependence of energy, rdefect(EIS).
The results are shown in Figure 6.
We ﬁnd that the minimum value is < rdefect(EIS) >∼3 Å, which is also the average dis- tance between two Si particles in a defect-free state60.
The average distance between the defect particles increases with energy and becomes constant after a certain energy range, sug- gesting that a breakdown of any spatial correlations among defect-Si particles.
The limiting value of the average distance can be calculated by evaluating the integral, L 2 Z 1 0 dx Z 1 0 dy p x2 +y2 ∼0.77L 2 (10) which for the 80 particle system corresponds to ∼7.55.
C. Microscopic realizations These results suggest that there exists a locally well-deﬁned defect structure for the defect-states close to Ecutoff d .
This structure involves no defect-O particles but two close-by defect-Si particles within a distance of ∼3 Å.
The two defect- Si particles have a coordination number of 2 and 4, respec- tively, yielding the average co-ordination numbers ⟨CSi-O⟩= 3, ⟨CO-Si⟩= 2 for the total system at Ecutoff d .
A typical structure of the dSi = 2 states close to the Ecutoff d is shown in Figure 7(a).
Starting from a defect-free struc- ture, one can generate this defect-structure by transferring one O particle from one Si particle to an adjacent Si parti- cle.
With increasing energy, more O particles are transferred further along the network and the average distance between defect-Si particles (< rdefect >) increases from 3 Å. This result has a trivial size dependence, as the oxygen transfer can hap- pen simultaneously at larger distances.
As a result, the value of < rdefect > in Figure 6 may increase at low energies for large systems.
This again underlines the need to study small systems to clearly elucidate the energy-dependent structural properties at low energies.
Furthermore, it explains our ob- servation that the difference between the two cutoff energies ∆Ecutoff is practically independent of system size.
A typical state with dSi = 1 is displayed in Figure 7(b).
These structures involve a dangling O particle with coordi- nation number 1.
Comparison of the states with dSi = 2 and dSi = 1 suggest that from an energetic point of view a state8 FIG.

with dSi = 2 is closer to the defect-free states than dSi = 1 and thus has the chance to display a lower energy.
The result shows that the average number of defect parti- cles and average co-ordination number of the system may not have a linear relationship with energy, at least near Ecutoff d .
In- deed, as shown in the supporting material Figure SM.4(a), the average co-ordination number of defect-Si states (excluding dSi = 0 states) states shows a minimum, roughly around the same location where dSi = 1 states are most populated.
This effect can be attributed to the lower ⟨CSi-O⟩value of dSi = 1 states as compared to the dSi = 2 states.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that for defect-O states (excluding dO = 0 states), the average co-ordination number is constant to 1 throughout the relevant energy range within our simulation set up.
The relatively late appearance of dO = 2,3 states in the energy spectrum might be a reason for this observation.9 FIG.

V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK In this work, we have shown that the phenomenon of FSC in 2D-silica model can be directly related to the properties of the PEL.
We ﬁnd that the both defect and defect-free-states have a low energy cutoff.
The energy difference between these en- ergies does not depend on system size which is a ﬁrst hint that the low-energy defect-states are fully local.
Similar to the case of BKS-silica, we ﬁnd that at the temperature where the system senses the presence of the ﬁnal low-energy cutoff, the fragile to strong crossover (FSC) in the kinetics is observed.
The results suggest that the emergence of the low-energy cut- off of Gdf(EIS) (or G(EIS)) is the major cause of the FSC.
Structurally, the properties of the low-energy defect states have been clearly characterized.
One can see that the defect ground-state is a spatially coupled pair of defect-Si particles which does not involve any dangling bond, in contrast to a structure with just a single defect-Si particle.
Thus the ab- sence of a dangling bond renders the double defect structure10 FIG. 7.

energetically more favorable.
The qualitative similarity of the observed FSC phenomenon between 2D and 3D silica supports the notion that the FSC may be a generic phenomenon, observed for network-forming systems.
Furthermore, it enables a quantitative comparison, revealing the impact of dimension.
A major difference be- tween both systems is seen in the normalized difference of the cutoff energies of the defect and defect-free states.
As another difference, we have observed that the low-temperature activa- tion energy for the 2D system is approx.
30% higher than for the 3D system.
Both effects may be related to the difﬁculty in the 2D system to ﬁnd reaction coordinates with low energy barriers.
Furthermore, we would like to stress that the 2D activation energy is more than twice as high as the energy dif- ference of the overall ground-state and the ground-state defect structure (0.26 vs. 0.11).
This reﬂects the complexity which is involved in the transition between two defect-free states, dom- inating at low temperatures, as well as the additional impact of activation barriers.
We would like to remark that here we observe a variety of different defect states (ﬁgure 4) when increasing the energy somewhat above their cutoff energy.
Furthermore, we found that for higher energies the density of states behaves like a Gaussian glass-forming system, as also supported by the lin- ear dependence of Eav IS on β in ﬁgure 2(b).
A well-deﬁned second Arrhenius-regime at higher temperatures is absent as well.
Hence, a direct application of the two-state model43–45 does not seem to be possible.
The present analysis has again shown that the choice of small system sizes is essential to learn about speciﬁc PEL- related properties.
Otherwise the low-energy properties would be smeared out and it would be difﬁcult to identify the micro- scopic origin of the FSC beyond the mere identiﬁcation of similar crossover temperatures in the thermodynamic and ki- netic properties.
It will be interesting to use a three-body force-ﬁeld (like Stillinger-Weber potential72) in addition to the two-body Yukawa force-ﬁeld, and analyze how the new 2D-silica model changes its properties near the FSC-regime.
In the present 2D-silica model, it is possible to unambiguously separate de- fect and defect-free-states based on a single cutoff radius at all temperatures.
It remains to be seen if similar analysis can be performed in other network forming materials which show FSC as well, such as water.
