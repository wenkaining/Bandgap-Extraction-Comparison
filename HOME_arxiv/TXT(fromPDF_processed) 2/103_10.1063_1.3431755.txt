arXiv:1003.1237v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  4 May 2010 Anomalous molecular orbital variation upon adsorption on wide band gap insulator Wei Chen,1 Christoph Tegenkamp,1 Herbert Pfn¨ur,1, a) and Thomas Bredow2 1)Institut f¨ur Festk¨orperphysik, Leibniz Universit¨at Hannover, 30167 Hannover, Germany 2)Institut f¨ur Physikalische und Theoretische Chemie, Universit¨at Bonn, 53115 Bonn, Germany (Dated: 18 November 2018) It is commonly believed that organic molecules are physisorbed on the ideal non-polar surfaces of wide band gap insulators with limited variation of the electronic properties of the adsorbate molecule.
On the basis of ﬁrst principles calculations within density functional theory (DFT) and GW approximation, we show that this is not generally true.
We ﬁnd that the molecular frontier orbitals undergo signiﬁcant changes when a hydroxy acid (here we chose gluconic acid) is adsorbed on MgSO4·H2O(100) surface due to the complex interaction between the molecule and the insulating surface.
The predicted trend of the adsorption eﬀect on the energy gap obtained by DFT is reversed when the surface polarization eﬀect is taken into account via the many-body corrections.

The performance of these molecular electronics relies intimately on the properties of the frontier orbitals of the organic molecule2 and the coupling of the orbitals to the surface elec- tronic states.
From this point of view, an accurate con- trol of the electrical characteristics requires unambiguous knowledge of the interaction between the molecular ad- sorbate and insulating surface.
The perfect non-polar surface of a wide band gap in- sulator, e.g. alkali halides is chemically inert with re- spect to organic molecules, and the features of the molec- ular orbitals are usually preserved upon adsorption as resolved by scanning tunneling spectroscopy3 and ﬁrst principles calculations4.
The ability to decouple ad- sorbed molecules electrically from the insulating surface also facilitates the use of alkali halides as supporting tem- plates for a wide range of applications5–7.
However, as we will show in this study, this scenario does not neces- sarily hold for all organic-insulator systems.
In contrast, we ﬁnd that, using density functional theory (DFT), the frontier orbitals of an adsorbate can vary signiﬁcantly upon adsorption on the surface of a wide band gap in- sulator.
Here we choose gluconic acid (GA) as a rep- resentative for the chemical class of hydroxy acids ad- sorbed on MgSO4·H2O(100) as the subject of investiga- tion.
Apart from the general relevance of the adsorp- tion properties of this wide spread class of molecules, our study is motivated also by the ability of this molecule to act as a conditioner for the electrostatic separation of mineral5.
We show that the strong variations of the fron- tier orbitals arise from the complex interactions between the adsorbate and the underlying surface.
Further, the a)Electronic mail: pfnuer@fkp.uni-hannover.de polarization eﬀect, which is induced by changes in the charge state of the molecule, produces a prominent re- duction of the molecular energy gap upon adsorption.
The description of the polarization invokes the use of GW approximation8 since this nonlocal correlation ef- fect is not captured by Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT eigenval- ues with standard exchange-correlation (XC) approxima- tions.
We stress that the results, although based on the GA-MgSO4·H2O system, provide a general insight into the interaction of a wide class of organic molecules (e.g. carboxylic and phenylic acids) on insulating surfaces.
We start with a brief description of the bulk MgSO4·H2O.
MgSO4·H2O has a monoclinic structure (space group C6 2h), and is chemically formed from MgSO4 by incorporating one water molecule per unit.
The crys- tal structure parameters were calculated with the PBE XC potential9 within the generalized gradient approxi- mation (GGA) as implemented in vasp10.
The electron- ion interaction was described within the projector aug- mented wave method11.
A kinetic energy cutoﬀof 500 eV and a 5 × 5 × 5 k-point mesh in the Brillouin zone were used.
The convergence criterion of lattice parame- ter and atomic position relaxation was set to 0.02 eV/˚A.
The resultant lattice constants (a = 6.79 ˚A, b = 7.79 ˚A, c = 7.69 ˚A) and β = 117.7◦are in good agreement with experiment and previous theoretical values12.
The direct band gap at the Γ point is severely underestimated by the GGA-PBE (5.53 eV) and the local density approxi- mation (LDA) (5.26 eV) compared to a surface sensitive experimental value (7.4 eV)13.
A much more realistic gap of 7.41 eV is obtained with the screened hybrid functional HSE0614,15 owing to the alleviation of the self-interaction error and derivative discontinuity problem by the non- local exact exchange.
As resolved from the projected density of states (PDOS) (not shown), the valence band maximum (VBM) is of O-2p character and the conduc- tion band minimum consists of Mg-3s and S-3s states.

For the adsorption of GA, a (1×2) MgSO4·H2O(100) surface supercell with 14 atomic layers (72 atoms) was adopted.
Test calculations using larger unit cells con- ﬁrmed that the (1×2) supercell is adequate for various adsorption conﬁgurations while keeping the intermolec- ular interaction minimized.
By construction, the (100) surface is cleaved in a way that the electrostatic dipoles between the Mg2+ and SO2− 4 are nearly within the sur- face plane.
Hence, the macroscopic dipole moment is neg- ligible along the surface normal, making this surface ther- modynamically more favorable than other surface planes.
The non-polar nature of the surface is also evidenced by the small displacements of the surface atoms during re- laxations.
For detailed description of the (100) surface the reader is referred to Ref. 13.
A vacuum thickness of 14 ˚A was used to separate the adsorbate system from its periodic image.
The calculations have been checked to converge well with respect to the slab thickness, k- point mesh (2 × 4 × 1) and kinetic energy cutoﬀ(400 eV).
For geometrical relaxations, we employed the PBE- D scheme4,16 to take into account the long-range van der Waals (vdW) force where it is important7,17,18.
In PBE-D, the dispersion (D) is constructed by an empiri- cal C6R−6 potential, which allows for a transparent and fast assessment of the vdW interactions in standard DFT approximations.
The electronic properties of the adsor- bate system were then computed with the HSE06 hybrid functional.
It is evident from the rotational ﬂexibility of the GA molecule that the geometry optimizations of the adsor- bate system will lead to numerous stable or meta-stable conﬁgurations and it is computationally prohibitive to lo- cate all the local minima.
In the present study, we used a scanning scheme in which the GA molecule was initially placed at several diﬀerent positions on the (1×2) sur- face supercell with an orientation parallel to the surface plane.
The whole adsorbate system was then allowed to fully relax until the equilibrium structure is reached, and the adsorption and interaction energy can be calculated as Eads = Erelaxed system −Erelaxed surface −Erelaxed molecule (1) and Eint = Erelaxed system −Eads surface −Eads molecule, (2) where Erelaxed denotes the energy of the corresponding unit in its equilibrium geometry, and Eads is the energy of the unit in the adsorbate geometry.
The diﬀerence between Eads and Eint is the deformation energy of the molecule and surface upon interaction.
Dissociative ad- sorption via deprotonation has been found energetically unfavorable and is not included in this study.
We ﬁnd that the PBE-D method yields a nearly identical adsorp- tion geometry as the PBE except that the dispersion force pulls the molecule 0.1 ˚A closer to the surface.
This sug- gests that the adsorption conﬁguration is largely driven by the short-range interactions.
In Fig. 1, the two conﬁg- urations with the lowest Eads (see Table I) are presented, both of which depict the ﬁxture of the molecule via mul- tiple localized Mg-O and O-H bonds.
Such bonding type implies that an ordered structure can be achieved on MgSO4·H2O(100) where the GA molecule is prone to lie ﬂat on the surface along the [010] direction.
Speciﬁcally, in Conf.
I the molecule is stabilized via three Mg-O bonds from the carboxylic and hydroxylic O atoms with bond lengths ranging from 2.10 to 2.16 ˚A.
The incorporated water molecule at the surface is not interacting with the adsorbate.
In the second conﬁguration, we see a domi- nating Mg-O bond from the hydroxylic O (2.06 ˚A), ac- companied by two weaker Mg-O bonds with larger bond lengths (2.22 and 2.55 ˚A).
Besides, one of the hydroxylic O atom binds to the hydrogen of the water molecule at the surface (Hw).
The diﬀerence in adsorption conﬁgu- rations has a direct inﬂuence on the binding energy as shown in Table I, where Eint calculated with GGA-PBE is 0.33 eV higher for Conf. I.
While the vdW interac- tion (EPBE-D int −EPBE int ) has been found substantial for3 both conﬁgurations (0.84 and 0.95 eV), it accounts for a relatively small portion (20-25%) of the total Eint com- pared to the short-range molecule-surface interactions.
Hence, we conclude that the long-range vdW force does not play a predominant role in the adsorption of GA on MgSO4·H2O(100).
Inspecting the charge density diﬀerence (Fig. 1), one ﬁnds electron accumulations in between the bond region upon adsorption, as expected for covalent interactions.
Note that the electron redistribution at the molecule- surface interface induces a change in the surface dipole by -2.3 D.
The covalent character is also seen in Fig. 2, where the molecular orbitals of the adsorbate exhibit broaden- ing and splitting due to rehybridizations.
This can be ra- tionalized as a dative covalent bond through the donation from the lone-pair electrons of the O atoms.
However, the covalent bonds do not contribute to the large inter- action energy from the GGA-PBE part.
In contrast, they act as a repulsive Pauli barrier because both the bond- ing and antibonding states are fully occupied.
Therefore, we ascribe the strong interaction energy to the attractive electrostatic interaction arising from the Coulomb terms.
The covalent character, on the other hand, accounts for the electronic structure of the adsorbate as we will show in a moment.
Furthermore, the charge transfer is found to be small.
For instance, a Bader analysis19 predicts that 0.01 e are transferred to the molecule for Conf. II.
This is expected as the energy gaps of both the surface and molecule are rather large.
An interesting indication of the large ∆Ed in Table I is the pronounced intramolecular distortion from its equi- librium geometry upon adsorption.
This feature stems partially from the intrinsic molecular structure of GA, and is not observed for some other organic molecules, e.g. hydroxybenzoic acid on MgSO4·H2O(100)12.
The sp3 hybridization in the carbon chain makes the struc- ture versatile through the rotation along the C-C bond with a small energy barrier, which can be easily over- come by the energy gain through the subsequent GA- surface interactions.
An immediate consequence of this structural change can be manifested by the reduced gap of the adsorbate with respect to that of the gas phase molecule (Table II).
In addition, our calculation on KCl(001) shows a minor deformation of the GA molecule with a much weaker Eads (-0.4 eV excluding the vdW force), an indication that the intramolecular distortion is also related to the surface.
The higher reactivity of MgSO4·H2O(100) is associated with its lower Madelung potential as the ions at the surface are more exposed to the environment.
We now turn to the surface and adsorbate induced ef- fect on the molecular orbital of the GA molecule.
It is surprising to see from Fig. 2 that, in Conf. II, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) experiences dramatic changes upon adsorption, even with the in- tramolecular structure kept intact.
A detailed analysis reveals that the order of the HOMO and HOMO-1 is reversed after the molecule is attached to the surface.

The adsorbed molecule refers to the GA molecule adsorbed on MgSO4·H2O(100) as in Conf. II, whereas the isolated molecule refers to the GA molecule detached from the surface while its geometry is kept ﬁxed as that of the adsorbed molecule.
The GA molecule in its equilibrium geometry is denoted by the gas phase molecule.
The energy gaps of the SA adsorbed on MgSO4·H2O(100) are given in parentheses for comparison.

This sends a signal that the adsorption can strongly modify the molecular orbitals even on pris- tine insulating surfaces.
The interchange of HOMO and HOMO-1 subsequently increases the energy gap of the adsorbate by about 0.75 eV with respect to the isolated molecule (see Table II).
We note that such gap vari- ation shows no dependence of the XC functional used.
The drastic modiﬁcation of the HOMO, however, is ab- sent for Conf.
I where the electron density redistribution is considerably smaller.
In Fig. 3 two distinct behav- iors of the frontier orbitals are perceivable when the GA molecule is lifted away from the surface while the in- tramolecular structure is ﬁxed at its adsorbate state. In Conf.
I, the gap between the HOMO and the lowest un- occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) experiences a small decrease relative to the isolated molecule.

I lies within the surface band gap, there is no coupling between the HOMO and the sur- face valence band.
Hence, the small gap reduction arises from the electrostatic potential of surface dipoles.
This also holds true for the hydroxybenzoic acid (SA) adsor- bate on MgSO4·H2O(100) as well as the GA on alkali halide (001) surface.
On the other hand, for Conf. II, the HOMO of the adsorbate is pinned below the surface VBM as a result of the resonance between the hydroxylic oxygen and Hw of the surface.
Since the hydrogen bond weakens rapidly as the molecule is gradually detached from the surface, one can see the accelerated upshift of the HOMO against the VBM as well as the declining of the molecular energy gap in Fig. 3.
It is thus clear that the strong variations of the frontier orbitals upon molec- ular adsorption stem from the rehybridizations.
The wa- ter molecule, which was usually thought to be inactive in MgSO4·H2O, however plays an important role in the electronic properties of the adsorbate.
We have seen up to this point that the frontier or- bitals of the adsorbate can be eﬀectively inﬂuenced by the molecule-surface interactions based on the interpretation from the mean ﬁeld KS equation within the single particle Hamiltonian.
Recently it has been found that dynamic polarization eﬀect has a strong impact on the energy level position of the frontier orbital by photoemission20 and electron transport measurements3,21.
The polariza- tion in the surface, which is induced by the added elec- tron (hole) in the aﬃnity (ionization) level, acts back to the molecule and gives rise to a renormalization of the molecular levels.
Apparently such nonlocal correla- tion is beyond the scope of KS-DFT and is not prop- erly represented by KS eigenvalues, while it is accessible from the self-energy Σ = iGW within many-body cor- rections, where G and W are the Green’s function and the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively22–24.
To illustrate to what extent the aﬃnity and ionization levels of the GA adsorbate are shifted due to the polarization, G0W0 calculations8,25 on top of LDA are performed for Conf. II.
We note that the polarization eﬀect should be similar for Conf. I.
The G0W0 approach is a ﬁrst-order perturbation to the KS eigenvalues, and the quasiparti- cle (QP) correction to the energy level can be written as the diﬀerence between the self-energy and the XC poten- tial VXC.
We used quantum-espresso26 for the LDA, followed by G0W0 calculations with yambo27.
Norm- conserving pseudopotentials, a cutoﬀenergy of 816 eV (60 Ry) and a 2 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh were used.
We included 200 and 400 empty bands for the isolated GA and adsorbate system in the evaluation of self-energy Σ, respectively.28 For the dielectric matrix 3400 reciprocal lattice vectors were used.
The random phase approxima- tion (RPA) and the plasmon-pole approximation with a plasmon frequency of 27.2 eV were applied for the re- sponse function.
The slowly decaying Coulomb potential in the repeated-slab approach is corrected with a boxlike cutoﬀ.
The QP gap was converged within 0.1 eV with these parameters.
The resulting QP gap from the G0W LDA 0 for the gas phase GA exhibits a much larger opening than the HSE06 HOMO-LUMO gap (see Table II).
When the molecule is brought into contact with the surface, a pronounced gap reduction (0.58 eV) is obtained from the G0W LDA 0 calculation.
This is clearly opposed to what has been found by DFT calculations.
As the charge transfer is very small, the gap reduction upon adsorption from the GW approximation arises from the surface polarization eﬀect, which can be described by the classical image charge theory22,23,29.
The aﬃnity (ionization) level of the molecular adsorbate moves down (up) by the image charge potential Vim = 1 4 ǫ−1 ǫ+1 e2 z−z0 , where ǫ is the dielec- tric constant of the medium, z and z0 the position of the point charge and image plane, respectively.
This implies that relative to the isolated molecule, the changes in the QP correction to the HOMO and LUMO should be anti- symmetric.
In fact, we ﬁnd that ∆EQP HOMO = 0.6 eV and ∆EQP LUMO = −0.7 eV, corresponding to a gap reduction of 1.3 eV due to surface polarization.
Note that apart from the polarization eﬀect, the change in the energy gap upon adsorption given by G0W0 (∆EG0W0 g ) in Table II also includes the contribution from the local interactions ∆EG0W0 g = ∆Epol g + ∆Elocal g , (3) where ∆Epol g is the polarization-induced change in the energy gap, and ∆Elocal g refers to the energy gap variation due to short-ranged eﬀects such as electrostatic interac- tions and rehybridizations, which should be in principle accurately described at the DFT level.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that ∆Elocal g = (−0.58) −(−1.3) = 0.72 eV, in excellent agreement with the HOMO-LUMO gap change upon ad- sorption from the DFT calculations (see Table II).
In summary, we have demonstrated that upon adsorp- tion to the surface of a wide band gap insulator, the molecular orbitals of the adsorbate can experience sub- stantial changes as a result of the complex interplay of the sizeable electrostatic interaction and rehybridization.
Further, the polarization eﬀect as described by the GW approximation, yields a prominent molecular energy gap reduction on the wide band gap insulator.
As the elec- tronic properties are dictated by the energetic positions5 and characteristics of frontier orbitals of the adsorbate, one has to carefully assess the molecule-insulator inter- face when interpreting the transport and spectroscopic measurements.
