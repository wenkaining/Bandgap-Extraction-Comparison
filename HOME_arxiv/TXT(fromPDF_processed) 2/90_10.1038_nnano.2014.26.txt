Hence the development of new systems that allow  improvements in their efficiency, spectral properties, compactness and integrability could  have significant ramifications.
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have recently  emerged as interesting candidates for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical  properties9–16.
Electroluminescence has already been observed from monolayer MoS2  devices17,18.
However, the electroluminescence efficiency was low and the linewidth broad  due both to the poor optical quality of MoS2 and to ineffective contacts.
Here, we report  electroluminescence from lateral p-n junctions in monolayer WSe2 induced electrostatically  using a thin boron nitride support as a dielectric layer with multiple metal gates beneath.
This structure allows effective injection of electrons and holes, and combined with the high  optical quality of WSe2 it yields bright electroluminescence with 1000 times smaller injection  current and 10 times smaller linewidth than in MoS217,18.
Furthermore, by increasing the  injection bias we can tune the electroluminescence between regimes of impurity-bound,  charged, and neutral excitons.
This system has the required ingredients for new kinds ofoptoelectronic devices such as spin- and valley-polarized light-emitting diodes, on-chip  lasers, and two-dimensional electro-optic modulators.
Main Text  Few-layer group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a class of  semiconductors in the two-dimensional (2D) limit9,10,19.
Due to their large carrier effective mass  and the reduced screening in 2D, electron-hole interactions are much stronger than in conventional  semiconductors.
This leads to large binding energies for both charged and neutral excitons which  as a result are spectrally sharp, robust, and amenable to electrical manipulation16,20,21.
In addition,  the large spin-orbit coupling22 and the acentric structure of TMDs provides a connection between  spin and valley degrees of freedom14, light polarization11,13,15,16, and magnetic and electric fields23  that can be exploited for new kinds of device operation.
Although in bulk TMDs the band gap is indirect, in the limit of a single monolayer it becomes  direct9,10, fulfilling the most basic requirement for efficient light emission.
Indeed,  electroluminescence (EL) has already been reported from monolayer MoS2 field-effect transistors  (FETs), occurring near the Schottky contact with a metal17 or with highly doped silicon18.
However, the efficiency and spectral quality was much lower than has been demonstrated for other  nanoscale light emitters such as carbon nanotubes7, for two reasons.
First, efficient EL requires  effective injection of both electrons and holes into the active region, which should therefore be  within a p-n junction.
Second, MoS2 is known to have poorer optical quality than other group VIB  TMDs, possibly due to impurities.
It has been previously shown that in contrast monolayer WSe2  has excellent optical properties16,24.
Here, we demonstrate that combining monolayer WSe2 with a  p-n junction architecture using electrostatic doping produces efficient and electrically tunable  excitonic light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
An optical image and a schematic of a device, made by a combination of electron-beam  lithography and transfer of exfoliated sheets, are shown Figs. 1a and 1b.
A monolayer WSe2 sheet  sits on a sheet of hexagonal boron nitride (BN), typically 10 nm thick, which acts both as a smooth,  disorder-free substrate to minimize non-radiative energy relaxation pathways and as a high quality  gate dielectric.
Applying voltages to the two 7 nm palladium gate electrodes beneath the BN can  create two separate electrostatically doped regions in the WSe2 separated by a 300 nm wide  undoped strip.
Gold/vanadium (60/6 nm) source and drain contacts are evaporated on top.
Importantly, they overlap the gates in order to reduce the Schottky barriers at the contacts.
For  electrical transport measurements a dc bias  is applied to one contact (the source) and the current   from the other (the drain) is measured by a virtual-earth current preamplifier.
The silicon  substrate is grounded.
We start by showing that a p-n junction can be created electrostatically.
First we set the gate  voltages Vg1 and Vg2 to the same value.
Figure 1c shows the current produced by a bias V = 0.5 V  as the gate voltage Vg1 = Vg2 is swept at 60 K (room temperature measurements are shown in  Supplementary Figure 1).
The current increases rapidly for gate voltages > +6.5 V (electron  doping) and < -6.5 V (hole doping), demonstrating ambipolar operation.
In the inset the red I-V  curve, taken at Vg1 = Vg2 = +8.0 V, is almost symmetric as expected for both gated regions being  equally electron-doped.
The nonlinearity near zero bias can be associated with the undoped gap  between the gates and residual Schottky barriers at the contacts.
In contrast, the blue I-V curve,  taken with Vg1 = +8.0 V and Vg2 = -8.0 V, shows the strong rectification behavior expected for a  p-n junction.
The p-n junction can be investigated in detail by scanning optical measurements25,26.
Fig. 2a is  a microscope image of a device and Fig. 2b is a corresponding scanning photocurrent image,  measured with zero bias at 100 K using a 10 µW diffraction-limited 660 nm laser spot scanned  over the sample.
We see a large photocurrent signal localized between the gates, with a peak  magnitude of 5 nA. Taking into account the 1% absorption of WSe2 monolayers at 660 nm27, the  internal quantum efficiency reaches a maximum of about 5%.
Such a photocurrent is the natural  result of the junction functioning as a photodiode, with photogenerated carriers separated by a  strong depletion field concentrated in the undoped gap.
The sensitivity of the photodiode can be  tuned over a wide range by varying the gate voltages and bias (see Supplemental Figure 2).
Fig. 2c is a corresponding map of the integrated photoluminescence (PL) intensity, which  indicates the high optical quality of the whole WSe2 sheet and shows that the luminescence is not  substantially quenched by the underlying gates.
More revealingly, Fig. 2d shows a colour map of  the peak PL photon energy, exhibiting two distinct regions clearly correlated with the expected n- doped (blue) and p-doped (red) parts of the WSe2 above the gates.
The reason for this is made clear  in Fig. 2e, which shows PL spectra taken at different positions.
The detailed origin of these spectralfeatures has been established previously16.
Above the gate held at Vg1 = +8.0 V (blue trace) the  negatively charged X- trion (two electrons and one hole) dominates, implying an excess of  electrons.
Above the other gate, held at Vg2 = -8.0 V (red trace), the higher-energy positively  charged X+ trion (two holes and one electron) dominates, implying an excess of holes.
In the gap  between the gates (black trace) the neutral exciton Xo peak can also be seen, consistent with no  doping in that region.
Here the superimposed X+ and X- peaks may come from the gated regions,  since the laser spot is larger than the gap.
When the device is configured as a p-n junction (Vg1 = -Vg2 = 8 V), but not otherwise, we  observe bright electroluminescence.
Good spectra can be obtained even at room temperature with  a current of 5 nA, as illustrated (blue) in Fig. 3a.
This current is three orders of magnitude smaller  than in MoS2 FETs17,18.
In fact, in our best device we observed EL at an injection current as low  as 200 pA (See Supplemental Figure 3).
To understand the nature of the EL, we superimpose a  normalized PL spectrum of undoped monolayer WSe2 (red).
It is known that the PL of WSe2 is  from the recombination of direct-gap excitons; thus the similarity between the EL and PL spectra  implies that the injected electrons and holes form excitons before recombining radiatively.
This is  a natural consequence of the large exciton binding energy due to the strong Coulomb interaction  in monolayer TMDs.
Fig. 3b shows an image of the total EL intensity (coloured) superimposed on  a simple white-light reflection image (grayscale).
It is clear that the EL emanates from the entire  length of the monolayer junction between the two gates.
At low temperatures the EL spectrum develops interesting structure.
Fig. 4a shows a plot of  EL intensity as a function of current and photon energy.
There are three main spectral features: a  narrow higher-energy peak (green arrow), a broad central peak (brown arrow), and a lower-energy  peak (black arrow).
The shapes and relative intensities of these features change with current.
Their  origins can be deduced from a comparison with the PL, whose intensity is plotted in Fig. 4b as a  function of photon energy and common gate voltage Vg=Vg1=Vg2.
Here we see the tuning of the  dominant exciton species as the carrier density is changed by gating16.
The PL feature which is  strongest at Vg = 0 is due to X0 recombination.
It has a similar width to, and is at the same position  (1.69 eV) as, the narrow EL peak, which we therefore identify as the X0 emission.
The dominant  PL feature at Vg > 0, which shifts from 1.663 eV to 1.625 eV as Vg increases from 0 to +8 V, is  due to X- (of which there are multiple species16).
The broad EL feature occurs in the same rangeof energies, implying that it is dominated by X-.
The dominant feature in the PL at Vg < 0 is due to  X+.
This aligns with the high-energy shoulder (grey arrow) on the broad EL feature at about 1.670  eV. There is also a band of emission from impurity-bound excitons (XI) in the PL which matches  the lower-energy EL feature centered at 1.59 eV.  The finding that X- dominates the EL in Fig. 4a is consistent with the observation that X- has  much stronger PL than the other exciton species (Fig. 4b).
The shifts of the trion peaks in the PL  with Vg imply that the trion binding energy depends on perpendicular electric field.
Hence the fact  that the width of the broad peak in the EL matches the full range of X- energies in the PL is  explained by the variation of the perpendicular electric field across the junction.
On the other hand  the X0 peak shifts very little with Vg in the PL and hence is insensitive to field; thus the X0 EL peak  is also sharp.
The X0 EL linewidth is found to be as narrow as 5 meV, which is an order of  magnitude smaller than for EL from MoS21,7.
In Fig. 4c we show the EL spectra at selected current values, illustrating sequential population  of the excitonic states, which could be due to current pumping or to changes in the electric field at  the junction under different source-drain biases.
At the lower current (24 nA) only the excitons  with lowest energy (XI and X-) are seen.
At a higher current (27 nA) the X+ shoulder appears, and  at 31 nA an X0 peak is also present.
At the highest current (33 nA) we illustrate how the spectrum  can be decomposed into four Gaussian peaks.
It is also apparent that the relative strength of the XI  peak decreases as the current increases.
The above observations reflect complex exciton dynamics which are not yet fully understood.
Time-resolved PL measurements have shown that the lifetimes (for radiative and nonradiative  processes combined) of the free excitons and the impurity-bound excitons are about 5 ps and 100  ps respectively28–31 in monolayer MoS2, which we expect to be similar to WSe2.
The electron-hole  pair injection rate is    (e is electron charge), which is one pair per 5 ps at 32 nA, comparable to the  lifetime of a free exciton but much shorter than that of XI.
Therefore, there could be only of order  one free exciton but many impurity-bound excitons present in the junction.
We speculate that that  the presence of multiple XI combined with the strong Coulomb interactions enhances non-radiative  recombination, which limits the XI emission at higher currents.
Alternatively, the saturation of theXI peak could also be due to the filling of impurity states as observed in standard PL and  photocurrent experiments.
We measure the total photon emission rate at the largest applied current of 35 nA to be about  16 million sec-1 (Supplemental Note 1).
This is 10 times larger, for 1000 times smaller current,  than reported for MoS2 devices17,18.
It corresponds to 1 photon per 104 injected electron-hole pairs.
We expect that the overall device efficiency could be improved by increasing the injection current  for a given voltage by reducing contact resistance, by improving the WSe2 crystal quality, and by  employing improved membrane transfer techniques.
Finally we mention an important implication of these results.
It has been conclusively  demonstrated using polarization-resolved PL that the excitons in monolayer WSe2 are formed in  the ±K valleys16.
The excellent match of the EL with the PL thus proves that the EL also comes  from such valley excitons.
In the experiments described here, the injected electrons and holes  populate both valleys equally as sketched in Fig. 4d, forming excitons in both valleys and thus  producing unpolarized light, as we have checked (Supplementary Figure 4).
As a result of the spin- valley locking in monolayer TMDs, where the +K and -K band edges have opposite spin14, we  expect that using ferromagnetic contacts to obtain spin-polarized injection will allow the creation  of spin- and valley-LEDs with controllably polarized emission32.

The difference in left and right  circularly polarized EL shows inconsistent fluctuations and never exceeds 5%, the systematic error  of this measurement due to optics.
Currently, we attribute any perceived polarization to the time- dependent fluctuations in the EL.
Supplementary Note 1: Calibration of Collection Efficiency.
For electroluminescence (EL) measurement, the signal is collected by a 40X, NA 0.6  objective, passed through the 685 nm dichroic beam splitter and sent into the spectrometer setup.
The efficiency of the system is  = 		, where  is the transmission efficiency  of the object leg,  is the collection efficiency of the objective itself limited by numerical  aperture, 	 is the collection efficiency of the spectrometer leg, and 	 is the ratio of  efficiencies of the spectrometer components (grating and CCD) at 660 nm (our calibration laser,  see below) to those in the EL spectral range.
The CCD and grating specification sheets were used  to estimate 	.
A Thorlabs S120VC power meter and a 660 nm diode laser were used to calibrate   and 	.
Finally, the objective collection efficiency is given by the integral over the solid  angle defined by the numerical aperture1,2:  1.60 1.65 1.70 500 1000 1500 2000         Electroluminescence (counts) Energy (eV) + - = 3 4       sin  	 (/)  = 3 2 1 −1 −	      .
In our case,  = 1 since the WSe2 is not covered with any material.
The total photon emission rate  from the junction is then  = measured/.
The rate of electron and hole injection is I/e, and hence  the efficiency (number of photons produced per injected electron) is (e/I)G.  1.  Fushman, I., Englund, D. & Vučković, J. Coupling of PbS quantum dots to photonic crystal  cavities at room temperature. Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 241102 (2005).
