In DMAMnF, we study the variation of the Mn2+ EPR line shape and intensity at  the X-band (∼9.4 GHz) and over 80 to 300 K, and we show the absence of magnetoelectric  coupling at the ferroelectric transition.
At the antiferromagnetic transition in DMMnF, we  detect a magnetoelectric coupling caused by weak ferromagnetism in the AFM phase.
In  DMZnF, the combination of EPR of the Mn2+ probe and DFT show that the crystal field is  predominantly determined by the DMA+ cations.
Introduction:Multiferroics exhibiting simultaneous magnetic and electric ordering offer the possibility of  magnetoelectric coupling, which is the electric control of magnetization or magnetic control  of dielectric polarization1-5.
However, reports of magnetoelectric coupling are rare even for  single-phase inorganic materials,6 which have been extensively researched for several  decades.
Perovskite-like metal formates with the general formula ABX3 are a class of  metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) that have received extensive research interest for their  ferroelectric and multiferroic properties.
7−23  Dimethylammonium zinc formate, [(CH3)2NH2]Zn(HCOO)3 (DMZnF), and dimethylammonium  manganese formate [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3 (DMMnF) are good prototypes of perovskite- like metal formates and have been studied in detail.
DMZnF and DMMnF exhibit a  ferroelectric transition at Tc= 156K and 185K, respectively, which is accompanied by a  structural phase transition.
Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of DMMF (M = Mn, Zn) in  the high-temperature (paraelectric) phase.
In the paraelectric phase, the DMA+ cation  undergoes hindered rotation, with the nitrogen disordered over three equivalent positions.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a tool of choice for probing the dynamics of phase  transitions.
The EPR spectra of Mn2+-doped DMZnF are very sensitive to the crystal field  modification induced during the ferro/paraelectric phase transition.
In DMMnF, the  correlation between Mn2+ ions is strong enough to create antiferromagnetic order below  TN=8 K. Additionally, magnetic correlation is known to hide some spectral properties even in  the paramagnetic phase.
For example, the 30 EPR lines (caused by splitting of each of the 5  electron spin lines into 6 hyperfine lines) expected for Mn2+ are blurred into a single line due  to exchange correlation.
Even in this case, EPR is sensitive enough to provide information on  the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic orders.
In this paper, we show how the motion of the DMA+ cation can be directly probed by EPR of  DMZnF:Mn2+.
Further, we show that the ferroelectric transition in DMMnF is not  accompanied by magnetoelectric coupling, in contrast to what has been suggested before.15  Finally, we observe weak ferromagnetic/ferroelectric coupling when DMMnF enters the  antiferromagnetic phase.
Experimental details:  Synthesis: Dimethylammonium manganese formate, DMMnF, was synthesized using a  standard solvothermal synthetic procedure, described in previous reports.7 Briefly, 1 mmol  of MnCl2·4H2O was dissolved in a solution consisting of 6 mL of dimethylformamide and 6 mL  of deionized water.
The solution was heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 140 °C for 3 days.
The supernatant was decanted and left to crystallize, yielding clear, block single crystals after  several days.
Crystals of Mn2+-doped dimethylammonium zinc formate, DMZnF:Mn2+, were  synthesized by the same method, using a Zn:Mn mole ratio of 1:400 in the initial reaction  mixture.
EPR: EPR experiments were performed using a conventional X-band Bruker EMX  spectrometer operating at about 9.4 GHz and between 4.5 K and 300 K. A small amount of  DPPH was used as a reference, in order to avoid intensity artifacts due to variation of the Q  factor of the cavity.
Magnetic field modulation associated with lock-in detection was  employed, resulting in the derivative of the signal.
All measurements were carried out with  the static field H perpendicular to the (012) face of the crystal.
All the recorded spectra can  be fitted by the derivative of a Lorentzian.
Simultaneous fits of the DMMnF signal and DPPH  signal yield the intensity, line width, and resonance field with high accuracy, and ensure  removal of unwanted effects caused by the cavity.
Results and discussion:   1- Origin of the crystal field in DMZnF:Mn2+.  Figure 2 shows the EPR signal of Mn2 + in DMZnF for T just above and below the ferroelectric  phase transition.
The spectrum consists of 6 allowed Sz=±1 (Sz=-1/2 to 1/2) transitions and  10 forbidden Sz=±1, Iz=±1 transitions.
The other allowed transitions (Sz=±5/2 to ±3/2 and  Sz=±3/2 to ±1/2) are not resolved due to a large crystal field strain.
Note that rotation of the  crystal does not change the lineshape dramatically.
Below Tc, the EPR spectra become much  more complex.
The Sz=-1/2 to 1/2 transitions are sharper and the Sz=±5/2 to ±3/2 and  Sz=±3/2 to ±1/2 transitions can now be resolved.
For T>Tc, the spectrum is rather simple to  simulate using the Easyspin module in Matlab.
We obtained an axial crystal field anisotropy  with D=250MHz, while a very large distribution of D, D=150 MHz, was needed to simulate  the linewidth and global shape of the signal.
This value of D cannot be explained by a  standard local strain, which is usually a perturbation.
To explain this value, it is useful to  remember that the Mn2+ spin is surrounded by 8 nearest-neighbor DMA+ cations (Figure 1).
If the timescale of the measurement is fast enough, the DMA+ are seen frozen in one  configuration.
In the HT phase, there are 3 equivalent positions for each DMA+.
Thus, the 8  DMA+ cations surrounding the Mn2+ spin can each occupy 3 independent positions, giving 38  = 6561 possible configurations.
In the rigid limit, the EPR measurement provides a  simultaneous “picture” of all the configurations.
Using quantum chemical methods based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), we have  estimated the zero-field splitting of some of these configurations.
It is obviously not possible  to test all 6561 configurations but a dozen of them were randomly selected and sampled by  DFT calculations.
Following a previously reported approach,23 we used minimal modelsbased on X-ray crystallographic measurements and consisting of one hexaformato Mn(II)  complex surrounded by 8 DMA+ cations.
Here we assume that the zero-field splitting (ZFS) of  the system arises mainly from the first and second coordination spheres of the metal ion, i.e.  the formate ligands and the DMA+ ions.
The distribution of the ZFS parameter was found to  be  DDFT~125 MHz, which is in rather good agreement with the experimental estimation.
Moreover, this result proves that the crystal field variation is determined by the DMA+  cations.
For T<Tc, D=15MHz, which is a much more typical value for diluted systems.
In this  phase, the DMA+ cations are cooperatively ordered, inducing the ferroelectric phase.
Each  Mn2+ sees the same DMA+ configuration and the distribution of crystal fields is greatly  narrowed.
2- Absence of magnetoelectric coupling at Tc in DMMnF  In DMMnF, magnetic correlation plays an important role and magnetoelectric coupling could  appear in the ferroelectric phase.
Temperature-dependence of the EPR of DMMnF was observed in the range from 300 K  down to 80 K, with particular attention paid near the structural phase transition (TC ∼ 185 K).
Figure 3 shows a series of spectra near TC, obtained in 10 K intervals from T = 210 K to T =  160 K. The sharp peak is due to the DPPH reference.
There is a small but clear jump in the  height of the DMMnF signal when TC is crossed.
The spectra were fitted using the derivative of a Lorentzian, and the line width, resonance  field, and normalized intensity were extracted from the fits.
The parameter of interest for  probing magnetoelectric coupling is the variation of the EPR intensity, which is proportional  to the static susceptibility.
The susceptibility obtained by EPR (Figure 4) shows no abrupt  change when the temperature crosses TC, indicating the absence of a magnetoelectric effect.
The jump in the height of the EPR spectra is a consequence of the change in linewidth andcan be attributed neither to a magnetoelectric nor a magneto-structural effect.21 This jump  is an indirect effect of the change of the EPR linewidth but has no physical meaning related  to magnetoelectric coupling.
3- Evidence of coupling between ferroelectric and weak ferromagnetic orders   Finally, we focus on the second transition of DMMnF, which is the antiferromagnetic  ordering at TN<8.5K. At high T, the EPR line is observed (Figure 5).
When the temperature is  decreased and approaches TN, the linewidth increases and should diverge at T=TN.
Below this  temperature, antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) lines appear; and these are shifted from  the paramagnetic line position because of the internal field.
This is the standard behavior of  antiferromagnetic systems.
However, here we can see that the line is quite convoluted near  TN.
At T=10K, the line is Lorentzian with a very good signal-to-noise ratio.
However, as the  temperature is decreased, the signal quality deteriorates due to the appearance of many  small peaks of high intensity.
This effect is maximum at T=TN, and decreases before  disappearing at 4.5 K.
This effect is due to the interference of the electromagnetic wave  inside the crystal, which acts like an interferometer.
Usually, this effect is observed at very  high frequencies and for large crystals.
It appears when (rr)1/2=c/f, where   is the  wavelength, r and r  are the relative permittivity and permeability, respectively, c the  velocity of light and f the frequency.
r is usually negligible but near TN, it diverges due to the  presence of weak ferromagnetism (canted antiferromagnetism) in the AFM phase.
Conclusion:  We have shown how EPR can probe the electric and magnetic properties in MOF.
Using  ferroelectric DMZnF lightly doped by Mn2+, we have shown the dynamic property of the  DMA+ cations and the origin of crystal field distribution in the sample.
Using the puremagnetic DMMnF system we have shown the absence of magneto-electric coupling at Tc by  presence of coupling in antiferromagnetic phase through the weak ferromagnetism .

The 3 possible positions of  DMA+ are represented in blue, green, and yellow.
At T> Tc, the DMA+ is disordered between  these 3 equivalent positions.

For T>Tc, only the -1/2 to 1/2 transitions  with MI = 0 (allowed transitions) and 1 (forbidden transitions) are seen.
The other  transitions are too broad to be resolved.
Below Tc, the linewidths of all the lines decrease.
The -1/2 to 1/2 transitions are now sharper and the ±5/2 to ±3/2 and ±3/2 to ±1/2 can be  resolved.

The small sharp line in the middle is due to the  internal standard DPPH.
As such, while this observation is in accord with those of Wang et  al.,15 additional studies after double integration showed no jump in the overall signal  intensity.
