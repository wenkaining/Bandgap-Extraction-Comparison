The ground states of these compounds are in a collinear antiferromagnetic order, resulting from the interplay between the nearest and the next-nearest neighbor superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions bridged by As 4p orbitals.
The correction from the spin-orbit interaction to the electronic band structure is given.
The pressure can reduce dramatically the magnetic moment and diminish the collinear antiferromagnetic order.
Based on the calculations, we propose that the low energy dynamics of these materials is described eﬀectively by a t −JH −J1 −J2-type model [1].

INTRODUCTION The recent discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO by partial substitution of O with F atoms below 26K[2] has stimulated great interest on the investigation of physical properties of iron-based pnictides.
This type of quaternary compounds consists of alternative tetrahedral FeAs and LaO layers along the c-axis.
The LaO layers act mainly as a charge reservoir.
The superconducting pairing occurs in the FeAs layers.
More recently, it was reported that the ternary iron-based arsenides AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) become superconducting upon hole or electron doping[3–6].
Similar as in LaFeAsO[7, 8], these ternary iron arsenides also exhibit a spin-density-wave-like anomaly and a structural transition from the tetragonal I4/mmm to the orthorhombic Fmmm group at some temperature between 140 K and 200 K [9, 10].
Furthermore, it was found that the high pressures can drive these undoped ternary iron arsenides superconducting [11–13].
To investigate the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials, it is commonly believed that one needs to understand ﬁrst the electronic and magnetic structures of the parent compounds.
It has been shown that there is an essential similarity of electronic states nearby the Fermi level in AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) and LaFeAsO by studying the nonmagnetic state[1, 14].
Moreover, the density of states at the Fermi energy is only weakly doping dependent and the main eﬀect of doping is a change in the relative sizes of the electron and hole Fermi surfaces[15].
In this paper, we report the electronic structures and magnetic orders and properties of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) obtained from the ﬁrst-principles electronic structure calcula- tions.
By comparison of the energy of the non-magnetic state with those of a number of magnetic ordered states, we ﬁnd that, similar as in LaFeAsO, the ground state of AFe2As2 is in a collinear antiferromagnetic order.
We have also studied the spin-orbit interaction and the pressure eﬀect in these materials.
The electronic and magnetic structure is found to be strongly aﬀected by the pressure eﬀect, but weakly by the spin-orbit interaction. II.
COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) takes the ThCr2Si2 type structure and an “A” layer plays a similar role as a LaO layer in LaFeAsO. Although AFe2As2 can be considered as a tetragonal 2FIG.

crystal with two formula units included in the corresponding unit cell as shown in Fig.1(a), its primitive unit cell is constructed by considering AFe2As2 as a triclinic crystal, in which only one formula unit cell is included as shown in Fig. 1(b).
In the calculations, we adopted the primitive cell as calculation cell with the experimental lattice constants as the input parameters.
In the calculation of the electronic structures of the nonmagnetic, the ferro- magnetic and the square antiferromagnetic Neel states, the a × a FeAs cell is taken as the base cell (shown in Fig. 1(c)).
In the calculation of the collinear antiferromagnetic state, the unit cell is doubled and the base cell is the √ 2a × √ 2a FeAs cell as shown in Fig. 1(c).
In our calculations the plane wave basis method was used [16].
We used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [17] for the exchange-correlation potentials.
The ultrasoft pseudopotentials [18] were used to model the electron-ion inter- actions.
After the full convergence test, the kinetic energy cut-oﬀand the charge density cut-oﬀof the plane wave basis were chosen to be 600eV and 4800eV, respectively.
The Gaus- sian broadening technique was used and a mesh of 16×16×8 k-points were sampled for the Brillouin-zone integration.
The internal atomic coordinates within a cell were determined by the energy minimization. 3III.
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS A. Nonmagnetic State We ﬁrst studied the nonmagnetic state of the compound AFe2As2 (A = Ba, Sr, or Ca), which is the high temperature phase of these materials.
The electronic band structure of this state also provides a reference for studying of the low temperature magnetic phases.
This can help us to understand the mechanism or the interactions that drive the magnetic phase transition and the related structural transition [19].
1. BaFe2As2 In our calculation, the experimental tetragonal crystal lattice parameters a = b = 3.9625˚A and c = 13.0168˚A [9] were adopted for BaFe2As2.
Figs. 2 and 3 show the calculated density of states (DOS) of BaFe2As2 in the nonmagnetic, square antiferromagnetic Neel, and collinear antiferromagnetic states, respectively.
As revealed by Fig. 2(a), similar to LaFeAsO, the density of states of BaFe2As2 consists of mainly the Fe-3d states from -2eV to 2eV around the Fermi energy.
Further analysis of the calculation (Fig. 3a) shows that the crystal ﬁeld splitting of the Fe-3d orbitals is much smaller than the one in transition metal oxides.
This is not very surprising since the electronegativity of As is much weaker than O. This suggests that the Fermi surface may have the contribution from all the Fe-3d orbitals.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface of BaFe2As2 in the nonmagnetic state are shown in Fig. 4.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), there are four Fermi surface sheets, contributed from the four bands crossing the Fermi energy (Fig. 4(a)).
Among them, the two cylinder-like Fermi-surface sheets centered around X-P are from the electron bands.
They correspond to the two Fermi surface sheets around M-A in LaFeAsO. The other two Fermi surface sheets centered around Γ-Z are from the hole bands.
These results agree qualitatively with the experimental observation [20].
The energy dispersion of the electronic bands along the c-axis is much larger than that in LaFeAsO[21, 22].
The sectional views parallel to (001) plane through Z point and Γ point are diﬀerent due to the large dispersion (Figs. 4(c) and (d)).
There is one band just below the Fermi energy along Γ-Z in Fig. 4(a), which corresponds to the third hole Fermi surface sheet given in Ref. 14.
The volumes enclosed by these Fermi surface sheets are 0.26 electrons/cell 40 5 10 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 0 5 10 0 5 10 15 20  Total-up  Fe-3d-up  As-4p-up     D O S  (s ta te s /e V ) b) E-E F (eV) D O S  (s ta te s /e V )      Total-up  Fe-3d-up  As-4p-up c)  Total  Fe-3d As-4p     D O S  (s ta te s /e V ) a) FIG.

and 0.26 holes/cell, respectively.
The electron carrier concentration is the same as the hole carrier concentration.
Both are equal to 2.54 × 1021/cm3.
The compound BaFe2As2 is thus a semimetal with a low carrier concentration between normal metals and semiconductors, similar to what we found in LaFeAsO [22].
The density of states at the Fermi energy is 3.93 state per eV per formula unit cell.
The corresponding electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ = 9.26mJ/(K2 ∗mol) and the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility χp = 1.60 × 10−9m3/mol.
These calculated physical quantities are also summarized in Table I, which are well close to the experimental values[9, 23–26].
We study the plasma excitation in the semimetal BaFe2As2 as well.
The plasma frequency fp is computed as follows, fp = 1 2π r 4πe2( nh m∗ h + ne m∗e ), (1) where nh and ne are the hole and electron carrier densities, respectively and m∗ h and m∗ e are the eﬀective masses of hole and electron, respectively.
We use the second order polynomial ﬁtting to estimate the eﬀective masses of carriers from the calculated band structures.
We obtain the hole and electron eﬀective masses as m∗ e = 0.60me and m∗ h = 0.86me with me 5-4 -2 0 2 4 0 2 4 6 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 -4 -2 0 2 4      d-total  dz 2  dxz/dyz  dx 2 -y 2  dxy D O S  (s ta te s /e V ) b) D O S  (s ta te s /e V ) d-total  dz 2  dxz/dyz  dx 2 -y 2  dxy a) d-total  dz 2  dxz  dyz  dx 2 -y 2  dxy D O S  (s ta te s /e V ) E-E F (eV) c) FIG.

being electron mass.
Because of irregular and strongly anisotropic band structure, the estimated eﬀective masses are with not small uncertainty.
We then calculate the plasma frequency as fp = 25392 cm−1 in the nonmagnetic state.
These values are also listed in Table I in comparison with the available experimental values.

The units for the carrier density ρ, the plasma frequency fp, the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ, and the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility χp are 1021/cm3, cm−1, mJ/(K2 ∗mol), and 10−9m3/mol, respectively.

SrFe2As2 Like BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2 can also become superconducting by chemical doping or by ap- plying a high pressure.
These two compounds have the same crystal structure.
The tetrago- nal crystal lattice constants determined by experimental measurements are a = b = 3.9259˚A and c = 12.375˚A for SrFe2As2 [4].
They are smaller than the corresponding parameters for BaFe2As2, especially along the c-axis.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface shown in Fig. 5, are similar as the ones for BaFe2As2.
The diﬀerence is that the band along Γ-Z, which is just below the Fermi energy in BaFe2As2, moves slightly upward and intersects with the Fermi level.
This results in the third hole-type Fermi sheet centered around Γ-Z. Therefore, in SrFe2As2, there are three hole-type and two electron-type Fermi surface sheets.
The volumes enclosed by these Fermi sheets give 0.32 electrons/cell and 0.32 holes/cell for SrFe2As2.
The electron (or hole) carrier concentration is about 3.33×1021/cm3.
The density of states at the Fermi energy is about 3.27 state per eV per formula unit.

electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient and Pauli susceptibility are γ = 7.71mJ/(K2 ∗mol) and χp = 1.33 × 10−9m3/mol, respectively.
And the plasma frequency fp is computed as about 27386 cm−1.
These calculated quantities are also reported in Table I.
The total and Fe-3d projected density of states of SrFe2As2 are similar as the ones for BaFe2As2.
The low energy excitations are also dominated by Fe-3d orbitals from -2eV to 2eV around the Fermi energy.
3. CaFe2As2 The tetragonal crystal lattice parameters obtained by experiments[26], a = b = 3.912˚A and c = 11.667˚A, are used in our calculation for CaFe2As2. Fig. 6 shows the electronic band structure and the Fermi surface.
Similar to SrFe2As2, there are three hole-type and two electron-type Fermi surface sheets for CaFe2As2.
Because the third hole-type Fermi surface of CaFe2As2 expands into a cylinder-like shapes centered around Γ-Z, the cross section through Γ and X in (001) plane has one more cutting line than that of SrFe2As2.
From the volumes enclosed by these Fermi sheets, we determine the electron and hole concentrations are 0.38 electrons/cell and 0.38 holes/cell, respectively.
The corresponding electron (or hole) carrier density is about 4.21 × 1021/cm3.
The density of states at the Fermi energy is 3.95 state per eV per formula unit, and the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ = 9.31mJ/(K2 ∗mol) and Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility χp = 1.60 × 10−9m3/mol.

fp is computed as about 20883 cm−1.
These calculated quantities are summarized in Table I.
The total and Fe-3d orbital projected density of states of CaFe2As2 are almost the same as the ones for SrFe2As2.
9B. Antiferromagnetic Neel State To study the electronic structures of AFe2As2 in a magnetic state, we break the spin up- down symmetry by assigning a ﬁnite magnetic moment to each Fe atom.
The ferromagnetic state is found to be not stable in AFe2As2, similar as in LaFeAsO [22].
However, the antiferromagnetic Neel state is meta-stable.
Its energy is lower than the corresponding nonmagnetic state by 0.232 eV, 0.175 eV, and 0.133 eV per formula unit for BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2, respectively.
The magnetic moments in BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2 are found to be respectively 2.3 µB/Fe, 2.2 µB/Fe, and 2.0 µB/Fe, similar as the one for LaFeAsO[22], while a moment of about 1.7 µB/Fe was found for all these three systems in the full potential local-density approximation calculations [29].
The density of states for the antiferromagnetic Neel state of BaFe2As2 is shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b).
The corresponding electronic band structure with the Fermi surface shapes is shown in Fig. 7.
The electronic structures and the Fermi surface topology are similar for the other two ternary iron arsenides in the antiferromagnetic Neel state.
As shown in Fig. 2(b) , the density of states around there is substantially reduced around -0.5eV in comparison with that in the nonmagnetic state (Fig. 2(a)).
The missing states are pushed down to around -2.0eV.
This change can be also seen by comparing the electronic band structures of the nonmagnetic and the square antiferromagnetic Neel states, shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 7(a).
In contrast to the nonmagnetic state, there are only two bands crossing the Fermi energy, forming a ring-like hole-type shape around Z, a cylinder-like electron-type sheet centered around X-P, and a small-pocket-like electron-type sheet around Z. C. Collinear Antiferromagnetic State For BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and CaFe2As2, the antiferromagnetic Neel state is a meta-stable state among the rich magnetic structures.
It is found that the true ground state is in fact a collinear antiferromagnetic state with the interlayer Fe moments in antiferromagnetic alignment.
The spin conﬁguration of this state in FeAs layer is schematically shown in Fig. 1(c).
101. BaFe2As2 For BaFe2As2, the energy of the collinear antiferromagnetic state is lowered by 0.400 eV per formula unit than that of the nonmagnetic state.
The magnetic moment is found to be about 2.65µB for each Fe ion in this state.
The electronic band structure and the density of states are shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 2(c), respectively.
In contrast to the nonmagnetic state, the density of states of As 4p orbitals in the low energy range from -2eV to 0eV is substantially enhanced in the collinear antiferromagnetic state.
Fig. 8(c) shows the Fermi surface shapes of BaFe2As2 in the collinear antiferromagnetic state.
There are two bands crossing the Fermi level.
They lead to a hole-type Fermi surface and an electron-type Fermi surface, respectively.
Here we remind that if we consider BaFe2As2 by a tetragonal unit cell, the axis MA in the Brillouin zone of the tetragonal unit cell is now folded into the ΓZ, in which M point coincides with Γ point.
This means that the electron-type Fermi sheet around M point in the tetragonal unit cell in the nonmagnetic state will be gapped when the collinear antiferromagnetic order takes place.
From the volumes enclosed by these two Fermi sheets, we ﬁnd that the electron carrier concentration is 0.042 electrons/cell, namely 2.05×1020/cm3.
The corresponding hole carrier concentration is 0.021 holes/cell, namely 1.03×1020/cm3.
Thus the electron concentration dominates over the hole concentration, unlike in the nonmagnetic state.
By using the second order polynomial to ﬁt the calculated band structures, we estimate the electron eﬀective masses as m∗ e = 0.31me with me being electron mass.
We then calculate the plasma frequency as fp = 7717 cm−1.
Here the contribution of the holes to the plasma frequency is negligible.
These values are also listed in Table I in comparison with the available experimental values.
In comparison with the nonmagnetic state, the electron eﬀective mass becomes much lighter.
Meanwhile, the carrier density is reduced by an order of magnitude, as shown in Table I.
This reduction is signiﬁcantly smaller than that in LaFeAsO. In LaFeAsO, the carrier density is reduced by two orders of magnitude in the collinear antiferromagnetic state than in the non-magnetic state [19].
The density of states at the Fermi energy EF is 2.41 state per eV per formula unit cell.
From this, we ﬁnd that the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ = 5.68mJ/(K2 ∗mol).
It should be emphasized that the calculated value of γ in the collinear antiferromagnetic state should be smaller than the intrinsic value of γ at zero temperature measured by experiments since the low energy quantum spin ﬂuctuations 11FIG. 8: (Color online) Calculated band structure and Fermi surface of BaFe2As2 in the collinear antiferromagnetic state with the antiparallel alignment between the interlayer Fe moments along c-axis [30], which is the ground state.

are suppressed in the calculations, as discussed in Section IV.
Therefore, the measured γ in the low temperature limit should be bound between the two calculated γ values obtained by our calculations for the nonmagnetic and collinear antiferromagntic states, respectively.
In Table I, we compare the calculated speciﬁc heat coeﬃcients γ with the corresponding experimental values.
For BaFe2As2, there is a large variety in the measurement values.
Experimentally, the ﬁrst reported measurement value of γ is about 37 mJ/(K2 ∗mol)[28], much larger than our DFT result.
However, with the sample quality being improved, the second reported value of γ becomes 16mJ/(K2 ∗mol) [9]; and the latest reported value of γ is 6.1 mJ/(K2 ∗mol)[23], which is in fact good consistent with our DFT calculation.
For SrFe2As2 and CaFe2As2, our calculated results are also consistent with the measurement values.
In the collinear antiferromagnetic state, there is further a small energy gain if the Fe- Fe distance is reduced along the spin parallel alignment direction and expanded along the spin anti-parallel alignment direction.
This leads to a structural transition from tetragonal space group I4/mmm to orthorhombic space group Fmmm, similar to that in LaFeAsO [19] and observed by the neutron scattering[10].
This lattice relaxation is energetically favorable because the direct ferromagnetic exchange favors a shorter Fe-Fe separation while 12FIG. 9: (Color online) Calculated band structure and Fermi surface of SrFe2As2 in the collinear antiferromagnetic state with the antiparallel alignment between the interlayer Fe moments along c-axis [30].

The symmetrical k-points in the Brillouin zone are referred to Fig. 8(b).
the antiferromagnetic superexchange favors a larger Fe-As-Fe angle.
It turns out that the angle γ in ab-plane is no longer rectangular (Fig. 1(c)) and the energy gain is 3 meV per formula unit, when γ is about 90.8◦, similar as in LaFeAsO [19].
The correction from this lattice distortion to the electronic band structure as well as the Fe moments is very small.
Along the c-axis, we ﬁnd that the Fe-spins between the nearest neighbor FeAs layers interact antiferromagnetically and the energy gain by taking the anti-parallel alignment is about 0.012eV per formula unit cell in comparison with the parallel alignment.
This antiferromagnetic interaction between the nearest neighboring FeAs layers is signiﬁcantly larger than that in LaFeAsO [19].
In Ref. 1, we reported the electronic band structure and the Fermi surface of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Sr, Ca) in the collinear antiferromagnetic order with the parallel alignment along c-axis.
2. SrFe2As2 For SrFe2As2, the energy of the collinear antiferromagnetic state is lowered by 0.383 eV per formula unit than the one of the nonmagnetic state.
The magnetic moment is about 2.55µB per Fe atom.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface are shown in Fig. 13FIG.

The symmetrical k-points in the Brillouin zone are referred to Fig. 8(b). 9.
From the volumes enclosed by the Fermi surface sheets, we ﬁnd that the electron and hole carrier concentrations are about 0.008 electrons/cell and 0.025 holes/cell, namely about 0.44 × 1020/cm3 and 1.31 × 1020/cm3, respectively.
It turns out that the hole concentration dominates over the electron concentration, unlike the case of BaFe2As2.
And the plasma frequency fp is computed as about 4249 cm−1.
In comparison with the nonmagnetic state, the carrier density is much reduced, by more than an order of magnitude.
The density of states at the Fermi energy EF is 1.54 state per eV per formula unit cell, and the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ = 3.63mJ/(K2∗mol).
These calculated quantities are also reported in Table I. 3. CaFe2As2 For CaFe2As2, the collinear antiferromagnetic ordering can lower the ground state energy by 0.352 eV per formula unit in comparison with the nonmagnetic state.
There are about 2.49µB moment around each Fe atom.
The electronic band structure and the Fermi surface are shown in Fig. 10.
The electron (hole) carrier density is about 0.016 electrons/cell (0.016 holes/cell), or 0.90 × 1020/cm3 (0.90 × 1020/cm3).
Thus the electron concentration and the 14FIG.

hole concentration are in balance, diﬀerent from the ones in BaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2.
And the plasma frequency fp is computed as about 5557 cm−1.
Similar to SrFe2As2, the carrier density is also much reduced by more than an order of magnitude in comparison with the nonmagnetic state.
The density of states at the Fermi energy EF is about 1.11 state per eV per formula unit cell and the electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient γ = 2.62mJ/(K2 ∗mol).
These calculated quantities are also reported in Table I. D. Spin-Orbit Interaction The spin-orbit interaction results from the relativistic eﬀect.
It is known that this inter- action leads to many interesting features in transition metal oxides.
To study how strong this interaction can aﬀect electronic properties of these materials, we performed a relativis- tic calculation for BaFe2As2.
Fig. 11 shows the electronic band structures of BaFe2As2 by including spin-orbit interaction in the nonmagnetic state.
By comparison with Figs. 4(a) and 8(a), we ﬁnd that the spin-orbit interaction splits the band mainly along Γ-Z into two bands by about 50∼150 meV around the Fermi energy.
15FIG. 12: (Color online) a) Calculated energy diﬀerences of BaFe2As2 between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state (NM) per formula unit cell under various pressures.
Note the energy of the nonmagnetic state without pressure is set to zero.

E. Pressure Eﬀect Experimentally it was reported[11–13] that the ternary iron arsenides AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) can become superconducting under high pressures without doping.
This provides another route to study the salient features of these materials in connection with the intrinsic electronic structures and properties.
The superconducting phase appears when the pressure is in the ranges of 2.5∼8, 28∼37, and 22∼58 kbar for CaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, and BaFe2As2 re- spectively.
The highest superconducting transition temperatures for these three compounds are 12K, 27K, and 29K, respectively.
Fig. 12(a) shows the pressure dependence of relative energies for the nonmagnetic, square antiferromagnetic Neel and collinear antiferromagnetic states of BaFe2As2, respectively.
The collinear antiferromagnetic state is robust against the pressure and has the lowest energy in the pressure range studied, consistent with the result reported in in Ref. 31.
Note that in this calculation, the lattice parameters are relaxed when the pressure is zero.
Thus the energy diﬀerences are slightly diﬀerent from that given before.
The lattice structure of FeAs layers, including the angle between Fe and As atoms and the bond lengths of Fe-Fe, Fe-As, and As-As, is hardly changed by the pressure from 0 to 80 kbar.
However, the contraction along the c axis is much more pronounced, especially in the nonmagnetic state.
This indicates that the distance between the neighboring FeAs and Ba layers is substantially reduced by pressure.
This can strengthen the coupling between 16the neighboring FeAs layers and stabilize the long range antiferromagnetic correlation in the FeAs layer.
The magnetic moment in the magnetic states decreases almost linearly with pressure, as shown in Fig. 12(b).
In our calculations, the magnetic moment is always larger than 2µB in the collinear antiferromagntic state.
The superexchange interaction thus remains dominant when a pressure is imposed. IV.
EFFECTIVE MODEL A. Local Moment versus Itinerant Electrons Physically the moments of Fe ions result from the on-site Coulomb repulsion and the Hund’s rule coupling of 3d orbitals.
An isolated Fe ion in a 2+ valency has a spin S = 2 with a large magnetic moment of 4µB.
In iron-pnictide semimetals, the eﬀective moment of a Fe ion (in a 2+ valency) will be reduced by its hybridization with other atoms and by the Coulomb screening of itinerant electrons.
However, it will remain ﬁnite if the Hund’s rule coupling and the on-site Coulomb repulsion is strong enough in comparison with the hybridization and other screening eﬀects, as we found in LaFeAsO [19].
In our calculations, by projecting the density of states onto the ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe in the collinear antiferromagnetic state of BaFe2As2 (Fig. 3(c)), we ﬁnd that the ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe are almost completely ﬁlled by up-spin electrons and nearly half-ﬁlled by down-spin electrons in one of the two sublattices (or completely ﬁlled by down-spin electrons and half- ﬁlled by up-spin electrons in the other sublattice).
This indicates that the crystal ﬁeld splitting imposed by As atoms is very small and the Fe 3d-orbitals hybridize strongly with each other.
We can see that this is a universal feature for all iron pnictides, as we ﬁrst found in LaFeAsO [19].
The strong polarization of Fe magnetic moments is thus due to the Hund’s rule coupling.
In low temperatures, the Fe moments will interact with each other to form an antifer- romagnetic ordered state.
These ordered magnetic moments have been observed by elastic neutron scattering and other experiments [7, 10].
However, they are not exactly the mo- ments obtained by the DFT calculations, as we indicated ﬁrst for LaFeAsO [19].
This is because the DFT calculation is done based on a small magnetic unit cell and the low-energy 17quantum spin ﬂuctuations as well as their interactions with itinerant electrons are frozen by the ﬁnite excitation gap due to the ﬁnite-size eﬀect.
Thus the moment obtained by the DFT is the bare moment of each Fe ion.
It should be larger than the ordering moment measured by neutron scattering and other experiments.
Our calculations show that the bare magnetic moment around each Fe atom is about 2.2 ∼2.6 µB in all iron pnictides and in diﬀerent magnetically ordered states.
In high temperatures, there is no net static moment in the paramagnetic phase due to the thermal ﬂuctuation, but the bare moment of each Fe ion can still be measured by a fast local probe like ESR (electron spin resonance).
Very recently, the bare moment of Fe has been observed in the paramagnetic phase by the ESR measurement [40].
The value of the moment detected by ESR is about 2.2 ∼2.8 µB in good agreement with our DFT result, which is but signiﬁcantly larger than the ordering moment in the antiferromagnetic phase.
Again similar to what we found in LaFeAsO[19], from the spatial distributions of elec- trons, we further ﬁnd that there is a strong hybridization between neighboring Fe and As ions.
This strong hybridization can mediate an antiferromagnetic superexchange interac- tion between the Fe moments.
This superexchange interaction is antiferromangtic since the intermediated state associated with the hopping bridged by As ions is a spin singlet.
On the other hand, there is a relatively small but ﬁnite hybridization between two neighboring Fe ions.
This direct hybridization of Fe 3d orbitals can induce a direct exchange interac- tion between the Fe moments.
This direct exchange interaction is ferromagnetic due to the Hund’s rule coupling.
Furthermore, there is a strong covalent bonding or hybridization between As 4p orbitals although the separation between As atoms is relatively large.
This hybridization gives rise to a broad As 4p band below the Fermi level.
Thus As 4p states are not truly localized.
They form an electron network connecting As ions through covalent bonding, similar to what we found in iron chalcogenides (α-FeSe and α-FeTe)[32].
However, there is diﬀerence that the band formed by As 4p-orbitals is insulating, as shown in Fig. 2, while the band formed by Te 5p-orbitals is metallic (see Ref. 32).
It turns out that the exchange interaction bridged by As 4p orbitals is short ranged (just J1 and J2) while the one bridged by Te 5p orbitals can be long ranged, as we found in α-FeTe in which there is a substantial third nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction J3 besides J1 and J2 [32].
18B. t −JH −J1 −J2 Hamiltonian For iron-based pnictides, the low energy spin dynamics could be approximately described by an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with the nearest and the next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions.
However, the Fe spin (or magnetic moment) is not quantized since the electrons constituting the moment can propagate on the lattice, like in hole or electron doped high Tc superconductivity cuprates.
Besides these superexchange interactions, the on-site Hund’s rule coupling among diﬀerent Fe 3d orbitals is important.
This is because the crystal splitting of Fe 3d levels is very small and the spins of Fe 3d electrons are polarized mainly by this interaction.
Thus we believe that the low-energy physical properties of these iron-based pnictides can be approximately described by the following eﬀective Hamiltonian H = X ⟨ij⟩,αβ tαβ ij c† iαcjβ −JH X i,α̸=β ⃗Siα · ⃗Siβ +J1 X ⟨ij⟩,αβ ⃗Siα · ⃗Sjβ + J2 X ⟨⟨ij⟩⟩,αβ ⃗Siα · ⃗Sjβ, (2) where ⟨ij⟩and ⟨⟨ij⟩⟩represent the summation over the nearest and the next-nearest neigh- bors, respectively.
α and β are the indices of Fe 3d orbitals.
c† iα (ciα) is the electron creation (annihilation) operator.
⃗Siα = c† iα ⃗σ 2 ciα (3) is the spin operator of the α orbital at site i.
The total spin operator at site i is deﬁned by ⃗Si = P α ⃗Siα.
In Eq. (2), JH is the on-site Hund’s coupling among the ﬁve Fe 3d orbitals.
The value of JH is generally believed to be about 1 eV. tαβ ij are the eﬀective hopping integrals that can be determined from the electronic band structure in the nonmagnetic state[33].
The nearest and the next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling constants, J1 and J2, in Eq. (2) can be calculated from the relative energies of the ferromagnetic, square antiferromagnetic, and collinear antiferromagnetic states with respect to the non-magnetic state.
For the corresponding detailed calculations, please refer to the appendix in our paper in Ref. 19.
For BaFe2As2, the energy of the ferromagnetic state is about 8meV per Fe lower than the nonmagnetic state and the Fe moment is about 2.3µB. From this and the relative energies of the two antiferromagnetic states, we ﬁnd that the exchange constants are approximately given by J1= 25.5 meV/S2 per Fe and J2 = 33.8 meV/S2 per Fe (S is the spin of the Fe ion) for BaFe2As2.
Meanwhile, we also ﬁnd that the interlayer superexchange 19antiferromagnetic coupling Jz =3.1 meV/S2 per Fe.
In obtaining these values, we have assumed that the contribution of itinerant electrons to the energy is almost unchanged in diﬀerent magnetically ordered states.
Since the bare tαβ ij and JH can be considering independent of magnetic structures, the relative energies between diﬀerent magnetic states are not aﬀected by itinerant electrons.
For SrFe2As2 and CaFe2As2, the values of J1 and J2 with Jz are determined as well and given in Table I.
As we notice, J1 in CaFe2As2 is negative, namely ferromagnetic, which is unique among iron pnictides.
C. Discussion We plot the superconducting critical temperatures Tc versus J2 for these compounds with doping carriers or by applying high pressures in Fig. 13.
Interesting, as we see, the maxi- mum critical temperatures Tc are in proportion to the next-nearest neighbor superexchange interaction J2.
This suggests that there would exist an intrinsic relationship between the superconductivity and the As-bridged superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions.
Here we have assumed that the value of J2 does not change with doping or pressure in comparison with the ones of the parent compounds.
This can be veriﬁed from Fig. 14.
Fig. 14 shows how the superexchange interactions J1 and J2 change with the pressure, from which we ﬁnd that J2 slightly changes with the pressure.
However, J1 drops quickly with increasing pres- sure.
This is because the energy diﬀerence between the non-magnetic state and the square antiferromagnetic Neel state can be signiﬁcantly reduced by the pressure, as shown in Fig. 12.
In comparison with the bare tαβ ij and JH, J1 and J2 are very small.
When we study charge dynamics like charge transport happening in iron pnictides, tαβ ij -JH part will thus play a dominant role.
In Eq. (2), if the J1 and J2 terms are ignore, the Hamiltonian will look similar to the double exchange model that was proposed for describing physical properties of colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) of manganese oxides[36, 37].
However, there is an essential diﬀerence.
In manganese oxides the crystal ﬁeld splitting between eg and t2g orbitals is very large, the moments polarized by the Hund’s rule coupling on the t2g orbitals are completely localized and only eg electrons can hop on the lattice.
In contrast, in iron pnictides, all ﬁve 3d orbitals of Fe have contributions to the moment and at the same time they can also hop on the lattice.
Nevertheless, we believe that their charge dynamics 2016 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45   BaFe2As2(35 kbar)  (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 (Sr0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 (Ca0.5Na0.5)Fe2As2  Sr(Fe1.8Co0.2)As2  Ba(Fe1.8Co0.2)As2   SrFe2As2(30 kbar)   CaFe2As2(5 kbar) Tc ( K ) J2 ( meV/S2 )     FIG.

In manganese oxides there is a strong spin-dependent scattering on the conduction electrons due to the strong Hund’s coupling between eg and t2g levels of Mn ions.
If the localized core spins of Mn are aligned ferromagnetically, the scattering of the electrons due to the core spins will be dramatically reduced because of no spin-ﬂip, leading to a giant magneto-resistance and a sharp drop of resistivity with decreasing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase.
In iron pnictides, there is also a strong spin-dependent scattering on conduction electrons caused by the Hund’s rule coupling.
In low temperatures, the 21moments of Fe ions are in the collinear antiferromagnetic order, in which the Fe moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along one direction but ferromagnetically along the other direction perpendicular.
Similar as in manganese oxides, the scattering of electrons along the ferromagnetic direction is signiﬁcantly reduced, leading to a sharp drop of resistivity and a large magneto-resistivity in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase, in agreement with experimental measurements[25, 38].
V. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have reported calculated results on the electronic band structures of AFe2As2 (A=Ba, Ca, or Sr) by using the ﬁrst-principles electronic structure calculations.
The ground state of AFe2As2 is shown to be a collinear antiferromagnetic semimetal with a large magnetic moment around each Fe ion.
The electronic structure is weakly aﬀected by the spin-orbit interaction, but strongly altered by pressure.
We have determined the density of states at the Fermi level, the speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient and the Pauli susceptibility in both the non-magnetic and collinear antiferromagnetic states.
The eﬀective antiferromagnetic coupling constants of the Fe moments are also estimated assuming that the low-energy spin dynamics is approximately described by the Heisenberg model with the nearest and the next-nearest neighboring exchange terms.
Based on the analysis of electronic and magnetic structures, we proposed that the low-energy physics of AFe2As2 can be eﬀectively described by the t −JH −J1 −J2 model, deﬁned by Eq. (2).
