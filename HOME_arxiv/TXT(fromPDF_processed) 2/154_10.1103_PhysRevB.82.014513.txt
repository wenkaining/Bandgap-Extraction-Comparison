Diﬀerent response of the crystal structure to isoelectronic doping in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 Marianne Rotter, Christine Hieke and Dirk Johrendt∗ Department Chemie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit¨at M¨unchen, Butenandtstrasse 5-13 (Haus D), 81377 M¨unchen, Germany (Dated: November 3, 2018) Superconductivity up to 30 K in charge neutrally doped BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 has been ascribed to chemical pressure, caused by the shrinking unit cell.
But the latter induces no superconductivity in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 in spite of the same volume range.
We show that the spin-density-wave (SDW) state of BaFe2As2 becomes suppressed in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 by a subtle reorganization of the crystal structure, where arsenic and phosphorus are located at diﬀerent coordinates zAs, zP. High-resolution X-ray diﬀraction experiments with BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe–P bonds, but a contraction of the Fe–As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2.
Since the Fe–As bond length is a gauge for the magnetic moment, our results show why the SDW is suppressed by P-, but not by Sr-doping.
Only the Fe–P interaction increases the width of the iron 3d bands, which destabilizes the magnetic SDW ground state.
The simultaneous contraction of the Fe–As bonds is rather a consequence of the vanishing magnetism.
Ordered structure models of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 obtained by DFT calculations agree perfectly with the single-crystal X-ray structure determinations.
The contraction of the Fe–As bonds saturates at doping levels above x ≈0.3, which corrects the unreasonable linear decrease of the so-called pnictide height.

This proximity of magnetic and superconducting order parameters is widely accepted as one key argument for an unconventional pairing mecha- nism, which is mediated by spin ﬂuctuations5 as it was considered for the cuprates6,7.
But in strong contrast to the copper oxides, superconductivity in iron arsenides can be induced without changing the carrier concentra- tion, either by applying external pressure8,9 or by charge neutral doping.
Especially the isoelectronic substitution of arsenic by phosphorus in REOFe(As1−xPx) with RE = La, Ce10–12 and AFe2(As1−xPx)2 with A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu13–15 has turned out to be an ideal tuning parameter to explore the borderline of magnetic ordering and superconductiv- ity.
In iron arsenides, the already present Fermi surface can be ﬁnely tuned by the crystal structure parameters in order to allocate optimal conditions for superconduc- tivity.
However, the detailed interplay between the crys- tal structure, magnetic ordering and superconductivity is hardly understood up to now, which is to some extent due to the lack of precise structural data.
One of the most intensively investigated iron-based material is BaFe2As2 with the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure3.
The stoichiometric compound undergoes a structural phase transition, associated with antiferro- magnetic ordering (spin-density-wave, SDW) at Ttr = 140 K. Superconductivity emerges during the antiferro- magnetic ordering gets suppressed, which can be achieved by hole- or electron-doping4,16 or by applying external pressure9.
From the latter it seems easy to conceive, that also the so-called ’chemical pressure’ by substituting arsenic for the smaller phosphorus atoms induces superconductivity in LaOFe(As1−xPx)?
and BaFe2(As1−xPx)215.
The au- thors explain the appearance of superconductivity as a consequence of the shrinking unit cell volume in analogy to the eﬀects of external pressure.
On the other hand, the unit cell shrinks comparably by substituting barium for smaller strontium atoms in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2, but no superconductivity appears in this case17.
Thus, a pressure-volume eﬀect is clearly an oversimpliﬁed expla- nation for superconductivity in the case of phosphorus- doped BaFe2(As1−xPx)2.
This is the more true, as the crystal structures of these compounds have not yet been investigated in detail.
We have therefore synthesized the series BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 and de- termined the crystal structures by high-resolution X-ray powder and single crystal diﬀraction.
We compare the structural data with theoretical models obtained by full- potential DFT calculations.
We will show that the sup- pression of the SDW ordering as precondition to the on- set of superconductivity is not a simple volume eﬀect, but depends on a subtle reorganization of the crystal struc- ture. II.
METHODS Polycrystalline samples of (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 (x = 0- 1) were synthesized by heating stoichiometric mixtures of the elements (all purities > 99.9%) in alumina crucibles enclosed in silica tubes under an atmosphere of puriﬁed argon.
The mixtures were slowly heated to 1123 K, kept at this temperature for 15 h and cooled down to room arXiv:1005.1411v2 [cond-mat.supr-con]  15 Jun 20102 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 8 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 .

1: AC-susceptibilty of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 with x ≈0.4 temperature.
The reaction products were homogenized in an agate mortar and annealed three to four times at 1173 K for 15 - 25 h. The obtained black metallic pow- ders are slightly air sensitive and therefore handled under argon atmosphere.
Samples of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 with x = 0-1 were synthesized by solid-state reaction of the ele- ments likewise.
The stoichiometric mixtures were slowly heated to 1123 K (1173 K) for 15 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the products were ground and an- nealed at 1173 K for 25 h (two to three times at 1273 K and 1323 K, respectively).
The obtained black crys- talline powders show no sensitivity to air or moisture.
EDX measurements resulted in the nominal compositions within 10% regarding to the Ba:Sr and As:P ratios.
Sam- ples between x ≈0.3 and 0.6 are superconducting with critical temperatures up to 29 K. No superconductivity was found in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2.
Since both phase dia- grams are known15,17, we show only the AC-susceptibility measurement of a BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 sample with x ≈0.4 as an example in Figure 1.
The crystal structures of polycrystalline samples were determined by X-ray powder diﬀraction using a Huber G670 Guinier imaging plate diﬀractometer (Cu-Kα1 ra- diation, Ge-(111) monochromator).
Rietveld reﬁnements were performed with the TOPAS package18 using the fun- damental parameters approach as reﬂection proﬁles.
Due to a better description of small peak half width and shape anisotropy, the approach of Le Bail and Jouanneaux 19 was implemented in the TOPAS program.
Giving con- sideration to possible texture eﬀects, the March-Dollase function was used for description of a preferred orienta- tion of the crystallites.
Small plate-like single crystals of ≈50 × 50 × 20 mi- crons were selected from the polycrystalline samples and checked by Laue photographs using white radiation from a Mo-anode.
Diﬀraction intensity data up to 2θ = 80◦were collected with an Oxford Xcalibur 4-circle κ- diﬀractometer equipped with a CCD detector.
Graphite- monochromized Mo-Kα radiation from a conventional sealed tube was used.
The intensities were carefully cor- rected for absorption eﬀects.

Positional and isotropic displacement param- eters of As and P were reﬁned independently, while their occupation parameters were constraint to unity.
Electronic structure calculations were performed with the WIEN2k package21 using density functional theory within the full-potential LAPW method and the general gradient approximation (GGA).
Detailed descriptions are given elsewhere22.
LAPW is based on the muﬃn-tin con- struction with non-overlapping spheres and a plane wave expansion in the interstitial regions.
Mixed LAPW and APW + lo (lo = local orbitals) basis sets were used to in- crease the eﬃciency of the APW linearization23.
Further technical details are given in the monograph of Singh24. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. SDW suppression in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 The unit cell volumes of the solid solution series BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 together with the data of the high-pressure experiments by Kimber et al.25 are collected in Figure 2.
Superconductivity (indi- cated by circles) indeed appears by pressure and by P- doping within the same volume range between 192 and 199 ˚A3, which is marked by the dashed lines.
But on the other hand, no superconductivity emerges by Sr-doping in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2, even though the unit cell volumes are within the same range.
Obviously, the simple shrink- ing of the unit cell is not the decisive condition.
Su- perconductivity is absent in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2, because Sr-doping cannot suppress the magnetic and structural transition.
The latter becomes only shifted to higher temperatures, as depicted in Figure 3.
In order to shed light on this apparent contradiction, a detailed look at the crystal structures is indispensable.
First, we have reﬁned the X-ray powder data by the3 1 9 0 1 9 5 2 0 0 2 0 5 1 4 0 1 6 0 1 8 0 2 0 0 	 V     T t r  ( K )    FIG.

4: Normalized iron to pnictogen (Pn = P, As) distances of (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 and BaFe2(As1−xPx)2, obtained from Rietveld-reﬁnements.
Superconducting samples are marked by circles (Color online). Rietveld-method.
The pnictogen (Pn = As, P) atoms occupy the 4e (00z)-position, where zPn is the only vari- able parameter of the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure (space group I4/mmm).
The doping dependencies of the normalized Fe–Pn bond lengths are plotted in Fig- ure 4.
Sr- and P-doped BaFe2As2 show very diﬀerent behavior, respectively.
While the Fe–As bond lengths in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 remain almost constant across the whole doping range despite the shrinking unit cell, the Fe–Pn distances decrease strongly with increasing P- content in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2.
This strongly suggests that a shortening of the Fe–Pn bonds is necessary to suppress the SDW transition.
The latter is plausible, since it is well known that the Fe–As bond length dramatically inﬂuences the mag- netism in iron arsenides26,27.
As a ﬁrst approach, we assume that decreasing bond lengths increase the band- width, thus a magnetic ground-state becomes less sta- ble as the bonds get shorter.
Figure 5 shows sections of the band structures with the approximate bandwidths of the Fe-dxz,yz bands, which should be strongly ef- fected by the Fe–Pn interaction.
We ﬁnd that the band- Z  Γ X  Energy (eV)   0.0   0.5  -0.5 BaFe As 2 2  0.55 eV  Z  Γ X  BaFe P 2 2  0.75 eV  Z  Γ X  Ba Sr Fe As 0.5 0.5 2 2  0.57 eV  FIG.

width of BaFe2P2 is much larger (+35%) compared with BaFe2As2.
But in the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe2As2, the band- width is almost identical to BaFe2As2, even though the volume is signiﬁcantly smaller.
B. Dependency of the magnetic moment on the Fe–As distance To support this assumption, we have calculated the dependency of the magnetic moment on the Fe–As bond lengths using a full-potential DFT method.
It is well known that DFT is unable to describe the exact value of the magnetic moment and the correct structure at the same time28.
But on the other hand, it should be possible to get at least the changes of the magnetic moment as the Fe–As distance decreases.
Thus we have selected a zAs value, which gives approximately the experimental mo- ment of 0.8 µB/Fe.
Then we used the ﬁxed-spin-moment method to calculate z-values by varying the magnetic mo- ments between 0 and 1.2 µB/Fe and relaxing the struc- tures subsequently.
We ﬁnd that the moment gets rapidly depleted as the Fe–As distance decreases (see Figure 6) and a shrinking of 2.5 pm (≈1%) is suﬃcient to suppress the magnetism completely.
This is a rather simpliﬁed ap- proach, since we used a ferromagnetic spin structure and kept the volume constant.
For this reason, also the As– Fe–As angle varies about 1.5%, thus it is not a priori clear whether the bond angle or bond distance is the crucial parameter.
To check the validity of our simple model, we per- formed full optimizations of the structure (volume, z, µ) using a G-type spin structure in order to model the AF magnetic interactions in the tetragonal phase.
Figure 7 shows how the total energy and the magnetic moment depend on the bond distances and angles.
The energy surface has a minimum somewhat beyond the experi- mental data (as usual for BaFe2As2), here also owing to the crude approximation of the magnetic structure.
More important is the fact, that the magnetic moment varies strongly with the Fe–As distance, but only slightly with the As–Fe–As angle.

7: Results of the full structural optimization of BaFe2As2.
The antiferromagnetism is approximated by a sim- ple G-type spin structure (Color online).
pliﬁed, indicates that the Fe–As distance is the crucial parameter which determines the magnetic moment, in agreement with recent results reported by Johannes and Mazin27.
Thus, we can assume that the small shifts of the distance plotted in Figure 6 are associated with the suppression of the SDW state.
It is worthwhile to note, that the suppression of the SDW in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 may not necessarily be caused by the shrinking Fe–As bonds.
One may also argue that the increasing number of Fe–P contacts enlarges the bandwidth, until the magnetic ground-state becomes un- stable.
In this case, the contraction of the Fe–As bonds would be the consequence of the lost magnetism rather than its origin.
However, this interpretation emphasizes that the Fe–As bond is in any case the gauge for the magnetic moment, as pointed out recently27.
By comparing these results with the data in Figure 4, we ﬁnd that the shrinking of the Fe–As distances in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 is only ≈1 pm (-0.4%) and thus not suﬃcient to suppress the magnetism according to Fig- ure 6.
On the other hand, the decrease of the Fe–Pn bond lengths is much larger in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and ev- idently suﬃcient to suppress the SDW.
Moreover, the calculated value of ∆d d ≈−1 % coincides perfectly with the onset of superconductivity in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 close to the doping value x ≈0.25 as shown in Figure 4.
Even though this scenario explains the diﬀerence between the Sr- and P-doped materials with re- spect to the onset of superconductivity, the data of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 in Figure 4 have no physical mean- ing.
Phosphorous and arsenic cannot have the same coordinates in the unit cell, otherwise the atomic dis- tances would be unreasonable.
As an example, the data of Figure 4 anticipate that the Fe–As and Fe–P bonds at x ≈0.25 are about 236 pm.
This is still reasonable for a Fe–As bond, but much too long for a Fe–P bond.
On the other hand, both distances would be 228 pm at x ≈0.75, which is now acceptable for Fe–P, but impossible for an Fe–As bond.
C. Theoretical structure models In order to to investigate the structural behavior of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 theoretically, we used crystallograph- ically ordered super-structures.
The tetragonal space group P4m2 allows to calculate structural parameters for the doping levels x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 without changing the symmetry.
During the optimization of the atom coor- dinates, all compositions except x = 0 converged to non- magnetic ground-states.
Thus, the SDW state is already suppressed at x = 0.25 in agreement with the experi- ment.
Furthermore, the zPn-coordinates of arsenic and phosphorus become signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, which lead to longer Fe–As and shorter Fe–P bonds, as expected from atom size considerations.
Selected bond distances are collected in Table I. TABLE I: Bond lengths of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 from DFT cal- culations x = 0 0.25 0.50 0.75 1 Fe – As 235.9 232.7 232.7 232.6 - Fe – P - 222.0 222.5 221.1 221.2 Ba – As 346.0 341.2 337.2 335.7 - Ba – P - 354.5 349.3 342.9 338.0 It is evident that the Fe–As bonds shrink signiﬁcantly only between x = 0 and 0.25, accompanied by the loss of the magnetic moment.
The contraction is about -1.4%, which is suﬃcient to suppress the SDW order as shown in Figure 6.
But higher doping levels do not further contract the Fe–As bonds, in contrast to the data in Figure 4.
At the same time, the Fe–P bonds remain close to the val- ues of the pure phosphide.
These ﬁndings draw a more realistic picture than Figure 4, because it combines the suppression of the SDW state by the appropriate con- traction of the Fe–As bond with reasonable bond lengths along the whole doping range.5 0 . 0 0 0 . 2 5 0 . 5 0 0 .

D. Single crystal structure determination From the crystal chemical considerations given in section B. and the results of the theoretical calcu- lations it is clear that the Fe–Pn bond lengths of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 obtained from Rietveld reﬁnements are throughout unsatisfactory, whereas the Fe–As dis- tances in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2 are reasonable due to only one arsenic position.
For this reason, we have con- ducted high-resolution single crystal X-ray structure de- terminations using small crystals (tenth of microns) of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 with x ≈0.3, 0.5 and 0.7.
Main results of the reﬁnements together with selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Table II.
As ex- pected from chemical reasons as well as predicted by theory, we ﬁnd the P- and As-atoms at signiﬁcantly dif- ferent z-coordinates, resulting in diﬀerent lengths of the Fe–As and Fe–P bonds.
The initial Fe–As distance is 240 pm and decreases rapidly up to ≈25% P-doping, but then converges to an almost constant value around 236 pm (-1.7%).
At the same time, the Fe–P distances remain about 1-2 pm longer than in BaFe2P2 at least up to 75% P-doping.
These experimental ﬁndings agree almost quantitatively with the theoretical prediction, al- though theory is not able to produce the correct abso- lute values.
Figure 8 summarizes this reorganization of the crystal structures of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 in compari- son with (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2.
A small contraction of the Fe–As bonds by ≈-1.5% (2-3 pm) is associated with the suppression of the SDW state, which is in turn the pre- condition to superconductivity.
This happens by P-, but not by Sr-doping, where the Fe–As bonds shrink by less than 0.5%.
Even though we have focused at the Fe–As bonds, we suggest that the Fe–P interaction is the underlying origin of the SDW suppression.
Thus we have rather detected the response of the structure to the vanishing magnetic state.
Interestingly, a similar response was not observed in undoped BaFe2As2 under pressure25, where supercon- ductivity emerges despite the Fe–As bonds remain con- stant as in non-superconducting (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2. IV.
CONCLUSION We have shown that ’chemical pressure’ is an oversimpliﬁed view, which is unsuitable to explain the diﬀerent behavior of charge neutrally doped BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2.
The true rea- son is the diﬀerent response of the crystal structures to doping.
Phosphorus doping suppresses the SDW state by increasing the width of the d-bands, which in turn leads to shorter Fe–As bonds due to its strong coupling to the magnetic state.
No signiﬁcant contraction of the Fe–As bond is detected in (Ba1−xSrx)Fe2As2, where the SDW state persists despite the similar volume change.
Single crystal X-ray data revealed the correct structure of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2, where arsenic and phosphorus are statistically distributed, but at diﬀerent coordinates zAs and zP, which is necessary to obtain reasonable Fe–P and Fe–As bond lengths.
The latter contract strongly at low doping during the magnetism is suppressed (0 ≤x ≤ 0.25) and converges to ≈236 pm at higher doping lev- els.
This behavior is almost quantitatively reproduced by DFT calculations using ordered model structures of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2.
Our results strongly emphasize, that even subtle details of the crystal structures are crucial to magnetism and superconductivity in iron-based ma- terials, where structural data have often been obtained from moderate powder patterns, which allow only limited resolution.
