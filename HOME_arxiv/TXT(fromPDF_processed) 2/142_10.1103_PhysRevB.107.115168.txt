Here, we theoretically study the plasmonic properties of such nonsymmorphic nodal-line semimetals.
We show that the nonsymmorphic character endows the plasmons with extremely strong anisotropy.
There exist both intraband and interband plasmon branches.
The intraband branch is gapless and has a q1/2 dispersion.
It is most dispersive and is independent of carrier density in direction normal to the nodal line, whereas along the nodal line, its dispersion is largely suppressed and its frequency scales linearly with carrier density.
The interband branches are gapped and their long wavelength limits are connected with van Hove singularities of the band structure.
We ﬁnd that the single particle excitations are strongly suppressed in such systems, which decreases the Landau damping of plasmons.
These characters are further veriﬁed by ﬁrst-principles calculations on 2D NbSixTe2.
Interesting features in static screening of charged impurity are also discussed.
Our result reveals characteristic plasmons in a class of nonsymmorphic topological semimetals and oﬀers guidance for its experimental detection and possible applications.
I. INTRODUCTION In topological semimetals (TSMs), the Fermi surface is consisting of symmetry-protected band degeneracies, such that the low-energy electronic states can have dis- tinct characters in their energy dispersion, pseudospin structure, and interband coherence [1–4].
This leads to many interesting physical properties, diﬀerent from con- ventional metals or doped semiconductors.
Clearly, the dimensions of the system as well as of the degeneracy manifold play important roles in the physics of TSMs.
For instance, in three dimensional (3D) materials, sta- ble degeneracy manifolds may take the form of nodal points [5–11], nodal lines [12–15], or nodal surfaces [16– 18].
In recent works, the possible protected band de- generacies were systematically classiﬁed for all magnetic space groups [19–23].
The TSM physics has also been actively explored in two-dimensional (2D) materials [24], which is another research focus in the past two decades [25, 26].
In fact, graphene is a prominent example of 2D nodal-point TSMs [27], and studies on graphene drove the whole ﬁeld of topological materials [28].
Meanwhile, there has been a lot of interest in 2D nodal-line semimetals [29, 30].
Many candidate materials were proposed [24].
However, most of the proposals suﬀer one or more of the following draw- backs.
(1) The nodal line is far away from the Fermi level.
(2) Points on the nodal line have a large variation in energy.
(3) There are other extraneous band coexist- ing at Fermi energy.
(4) The material is hypothetical, ∗hrchang@mail.ustc.edu.cn or is not stable at ambient condition.
Points (1-3) make it diﬃcult to probe signatures of nodal-line states, and point (4) poses challenge for experimental studies as well as possible applications.
Recently, a series of theoretical and experimental works have established a good TSM state in the NbSixTe2 fam- ily materials [31–36].
These materials were ﬁrst syn- thesized in the 1990s [37].
In the 3D bulk form, they are van der Waals layered materials, so 2D ultrathin layers can be readily obtained via mechanical exfolia- tion [38].
It was shown that the bulk material possesses hourglass nodal loops, whereas the 2D monolayer is an almost ideal nodal-line semimetal protected by a non- symmorphic symmetry [31].
More interesting, this fam- ily belongs to so-called composition-tunable materials, i.e., there exist a series of stoichiometric members with the formula Nb2n+1SinTe4n+2, or equivalently NbSixTe2 with x = n/(2n + 1) ∈[1/3, 1/2] [37, 39–41].
While the speciﬁc band dispersion varies with n, all these members in 2D feature the nonsymmorphic nodal line [34].
It was found that the low-energy bands that make the nodal line are mainly from an array of NbTe2 chains, which can be well captured by a 2D Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger (SSH) like model [36].
Evidently, the NbSixTe2 family materials of- fer a promising platform for studying the physics of 2D nodal-line TSMs.
Among various physical properties, plasmons, the col- lective modes associated with density oscillations of elec- tron liquid, could directly manifest the distinct charac- ters of low-energy electronic states.
Indeed, plasmons of graphene and other TSMs have attracted great inter- est [42–52].
However, plasmons associated with nodal- line states were mainly studied in 3D systems, and the arXiv:2211.03621v1  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  7 Nov 20222 line is often assumed to have the shape of a perfect ring in Brillouin zone (BZ) [53–55].
This is not the case for the nonsymmorphic nodal line in 2D NbSixTe2, which tra- verses the BZ along a straight path and exhibits strong anisotropy [34, 36].
Thus, it is desirable to ﬁnd out how this nonsymmorphic nodal-line state impacts the plas- mon properties.
In this work, we undertake this task and investigate the plasmons of nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
First, by using the 2D SSH like model, we show that the plas- mon spectrum contains two parts, denoted as intraband and interband plasmons.
The intraband plasmon branch is gapless and has a q1/2 dispersion.
The scaling of plas- mon frequency with carrier density n (or Fermi energy) depends on the propagation direction, which crossovers from ∼n0 normal to the nodal line to ∼n along the line.
Meanwhile, the two interband branches are gapped and are connected to the van Hove singularities of the band structure.
All plasmon branches exhibit strong anisotropy and a characteristic angular dependence.
The single particle excitations are strongly suppressed in such systems, such that the plasmons may enjoy less damp- ing and longer lifetime.
By using ﬁrst-principles calcula- tions, we show that the key features obtained from the model study can indeed manifest in monolayer NbSixTe2, which distinguish the system from conventional metals and doped semiconductors.
In addition, we show that the screening charge density induced by a charged impurity also exhibits an interesting signature owing to the non- symmorphic nodal line.
Our work reveals characteristic plasmon modes in a class of 2D TSMs and oﬀers guid- ance for further experimental study on NbSixTe2 family materials. II.
DIRAC SSH MODEL In order to capture the nonsymmorphic nodal line in NbSixTe2 family materials, a minimal lattice model was proposed by some of the current authors in Ref. [36].
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce this model and discuss its main features.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the model is deﬁned on a 2D rectangular lattice, with each unit cell containing two sites A and B.
It is more illuminating by view- ing the model as consisting of an array of zigzag chains running along the x direction (see Fig. 1(a)).
Physi- cally, each zigzag chain corresponds to a NbTe2 chain in NbSixTe2 [34].
The crucial symmetries that constrain the system are the glide mirror ˜ My = {My| 1 20} and the time reversal symmetry T .
The glide mirror is a non- symmorphic symmetry which involves half lattice trans- lations along the mirror line.
We shall see that these two symmetries determine the existence of the nodal line.
The model can be constructed in two steps.
First, one writes down the Hamiltonian for a single zigzag chain FIG.
1. (a) Schematic diagram of the lattice model.
The unit cell is indicated by the black rectangle.
(b) Brillouin zone (BZ) of the model.
The nodal line at the boundary of BZ is highlighted in red.
(c-d) Band structure of the model.
Here, energy is in unit of t, we set t′ = 0.3t, and kx (ky) is in unit of ℓ−1 x (ℓ−1 y ).
labeled by j: Hj chain = X i (ta† i,jbi,j + ta† i,jbi−1,j + h.c.), (1) where ai,j and bi,j are the particle operators for A and B sites in a unit cell labeled by the index (i, j).
We suppress spin indices in the model, because the spin-orbit coupling strength in NbSixTe2 is found to be weak [33, 34, 36].
This 1D model is similar to the famous SSH model [56].
However, in SSH model, the two t’s in the parenthesis of (1) are typically of diﬀerent values, allowing for a dimer- ization pattern.
In comparison, here, the two hopping amplitudes must be equal, as dictated by the ˜ My sym- metry.
It follows that the spectrum of model (1) must be gapless, with two bands crossing at a Dirac node at the BZ boundary k = π/ℓx, where k is the wave vector along the chain and ℓx is the lattice constant along x.
The second step is to add the interchain coupling to form a 2D model.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the coupling is added between nearest sites of two neighboring chains, described by Hinter = X ij (t′a† i,j+1bi,j + t′a† i+1,j+1bi,j + h.c.).
(2) Again, the two t′’s in (2) are dictated by ˜ My to be equal.
In real materials, the interchain coupling is typi- cally much smaller compared to the intrachain coupling.
This will be assumed in the following discussion.
Combining the two parts gives the whole model H = X j Hj chain + Hinter.
(3)3 It is important to note that adding the interchain cou- pling does not open a gap in the spectrum.
This feature is solely dictated by symmetry.
Consider the algebraic relation satisﬁed by ˜ My: ˜ M 2 y = T10 = e−ikxℓx, (4) where T10 is the unit lattice translation along x (the chain direction).
Since [T , ˜ My] = 0 and T 2 = 1 here, we have (T ˜ My)2 = e−ikxℓx.
(5) Importantly, each point on the BZ boundary path kx = π/ℓx (X-M) is invariant under the anti-unitary symme- try T ˜ My, and (T ˜ My)2 = −1 there.
Therefore, the bands on the X-M path must be doubly degenerate, and this dictates the presence of a nodal line along this path, as indicated in Fig. 1(b).
In the current model, this nodal line must be formed by the crossing of the two bands.
This also means that the Dirac node we noticed in (1) is not destroyed by the interchain coupling, instead, it extends into a Dirac line at the BZ boundary in the 2D model.
In order to stress this important diﬀerence from the conventional SSH model, model (3) was termed as the Dirac SSH model in Ref. [36].
After Fourier transform to momentum space, we have H(k) = t  0 1 + e−ikxℓx 1 + eikxℓx 0  + t′  0 e−ikyℓy(1 + e−ikxℓx) eikyℓy(1 + eikxℓx) 0  , (6) where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the intrachain cou- pling, and the second term corresponds to the interchain coupling.
The model can be easily diagonalized and its spectrum is given by Es(k) = 2s cos kxℓx 2 ·  t2 + 2tt′ cos(kyℓy) + t′21/2 , (7) with s = ±1.
The result conﬁrms a nodal line at kx = π/ℓx, where the two bands cross at zero energy.
The band structure of the model is plotted in Fig. 1(c-d), from which one can visualize the nodal line at the BZ bound- ary.
One may expand (7) at a point k∗= (π/ℓx, ky) on the nodal line.
Then, to the linear order in q, i.e., the deviation from k∗, we have Es,k∗(q) ≈−sℏvF (k∗)qx, (8) where vF (k∗) = ℓx  t2 + 2tt′ cos(kyℓy) + t′21/2 /ℏ (9) is the Fermi velocity along kx direction at the k∗point.
This conﬁrms the Dirac type linear band crossing at the nodal line.
In this work, we always assume the model is around half ﬁlling, i.e., the Fermi energy is not far away from the Dirac line.
One can easily calculate the density of states (DOS) D(E) = g Z [dk] δ(E −Es(k)) (10) for the Dirac SSH model, where g = 2 is the spin degen- eracy, and [dk] ≡P s d2k/(2π)2 is a shorthand notation.
At low energies E, DOS can be obtained by using Eq. (8) as D(E) = g πΩt 2 π(1 + ζ)K  4ζ (1 + ζ)2  ≈ g πΩt  1 + 1 4ζ2  .
(11) Here, Ω= ℓxℓy is the area of a unit cell, ζ = t′/t < 1 is a small number by our assumption, K is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind, and in the second step, we made a series expansion in ζ to the second order.
As a common feature for nodal lines in 2D, the DOS is independent of energy E.
This is similar to the usual 2D electron gas, but is distinct from 2D nodal-point TSMs (like graphene) whose DOS D(E) ∼E [27].
From result (11), the carrier density at low doping is given by n(EF ) = DEF , (12) where EF is the Fermi energy.
Before proceeding, we comment that in 2D systems, besides nonsymmorphic symmetry, a nodal line may also be protected by a horizontal symmorphic mirror plane.
For that case, the nodal line typically has the shape of a ring centered around a high-symmetry point in BZ.
In comparison, here, the nonsymmorphic nodal line in Dirac SSH model is enforced to be located on a path at the BZ boundary, and this distinct shape manifests a strong in-plane anisotropy.
In fact, the two diﬀerent shapes of nodal lines, i.e., a ring around a point or a line travers- ing BZ, correspond to diﬀerent topological classes. As shown in Ref.
[57], they are distinguished by the funda- mental (homotopy) group of BZ π1(T 2), which describes the winding of a loop around the BZ torus.
Clearly, a nodal ring does not wind around the BZ, whereas the nodal line in Fig. 1(b) winds through the BZ once along the ky direction.
This strong anisotropy of the nodal line in Dirac SSH model will manifest in the plasmon prop- erties, as we will discuss below. III.
PLASMONS IN DIRAC SSH MODEL Plasmons can be identiﬁed as the zeros of the dynam- ical dielectric function ε (q, ω) of the system.
Here, we evaluate ε (q, ω) for our 2D Dirac SSH model using the random phase approximation (RPA), so that ε (q, ω) = 1 −vqχ0 (q, ω) , (13) where vq = 2πe2 κq the Fourier component of Coulomb po- tential in 2D , κ is the background dielectric constant, and4 χ0 is the single-particle polarization function.
Explicitly, we have χ0 (q, ω) =g X ss′ Z d2k (2π)2 (fsk −fs′k+q) · F k,k+q ss′ Es(k) −Es′(k + q) + ℏω + iη , (14) where fsk is the Fermi distribution function for the band eigenstate |usk⟩, F k,k+q ss′ = |⟨usk|us′k+q⟩|2 is the overlap form factor, and η is a small positive number related to the quasiparticle lifetime.
Owing to the band structure of the Dirac SSH model and the constraint from the overlap form factor, we shall see that the contributions in χ0 from s = s′ and from s ̸= s′ give distinct plasmon branches and they are sep- arated in energy.
Therefore, in the following, we shall study them separately.
The former (from s = s′) will be referred to as intraband plasmons, and the latter (from s ̸= s′) will be called interband plasmons.
A. Intraband plasmons In this subsection, we examine the intraband plasmons arising from the contributions with s = s′.
Let’s ﬁrst consider the limit with t′ →0, where the analysis can be greatly simpliﬁed yet the results already manifest general features of the system.
In this limit, the zigzag chains are totally decoupled.
Physically, in NbSixTe2 family materials, this limit corresponds to the case with x →1/2.
It is important to note that for this limit, we have the form factor F k,k+q ss′ = δss′, (15) which means only intraband contribution exists, and the interband contribution is totally suppressed.
Then, by substituting Eqs.
(8) and (9) into (14), one can obtain χ0 (q, ω) = g vF πℏℓy q2 x ω2 −ig qx ℏℓy δ (ω −vF qx) , (16) where vF ≡ℓxt/ℏis the constant Fermi velocity normal to the nodal line in this limit.
The plasmon dispersion is found by substituting (16) into (13) and requesting Re ε (q, ω) = 0.
This gives the following intraband plasmon branch ωq = r 2grs ΩvF p ℓxq cos θq, (17) where rs = e2/ (κℏvF ) is the dimensionless ﬁne structure constant, q = |q|, and θq is the (in-plane) polar angle for the q vector.
There are several notable features of this intraband plasmon branch.
First, it is gapless with a ω ∼√q dis- persion, which is characteristic for 2D systems, such as 2D electron gas and graphene.
Second, the dispersion is independent of the carrier density n (or the Fermi en- ergy).
This behavior is in contrast to other 2D systems, such as 2D electron gas with ω ∼n1/2 and graphene (nodal-point TSM) with ω ∼n1/4 [44].
It is a character for a 2D nodal-line TSM.
Third, as we discussed, the non- symmorphic nodal line here exhibits a strong anisotropy.
This manifests in the dispersion through the cos θq de- pendence, so that the dispersion is largest in the x direc- tion and is suppressed in the y direction.
Finally, due to the rs factor, the frequency explicitly involves the Planck constant ℏ.
This is in contrast to ordinary electron liq- uids where the long wavelength plasma frequency is clas- sical (does not involve ℏ) [58]. As noted in Ref.
[44], this feature indicates the quantum character of Dirac type fermions.
The damping and lifetime of plasmons are closely re- lated to the single particle excitation (SPE) continuum, which can be derived from the imaginary part of the po- larization function.
From the Eq. (16), we see that in the limit of decoupled chains, SPE occurs only on the line ω = vF qx in the (q, ω) parameter space.
This is in sharp contrast to other 2D systems (like 2D electron gas and graphene) where the SPE always covers an extended region [42, 58].
It follows that the plasmons in the Dirac SSH system can be hardly damped by SPEs and should have a long lifetime.
This feature could be beneﬁcial for possible plasmon-based applications.
Next, we add the interchain coupling t′ and investigate its eﬀects on the intraband plasmons.
Again, please note that we assume ζ = t′/t is small.
In this case, the overlap form factor becomes F k,k+q ss′ = δss′ −1 4ss′ζ2q2 y cos2 (kyℓy) , (18) where higher order correction terms of O(ζ4) are ignored.
One observes that the second term in (18) gives a correc- tion for the intraband contribution.
Meanwhile, it also makes the interband contribution nonzero, which we shall discuss in the next subsection.
Substituting (18) into (14) and considering the long wavelength limit with q ≪kF ≡EF /(ℏvF ), we ﬁnd that for the intraband term Im χintra 0 ≈2πgω Z FS [dk] v−1 sk F k,k+q ss ×δ [Es(k) −Es(k + q) + ℏω] , (19) where the integration is performed on the Fermi surface, and vsk = ∇kEs(k)/ℏis the group velocity of state |usk⟩.
From this expression, the intraband SPE continuum can be derived as ℏω = Λxqx + Λyqy, (20) where Λx and Λy are functions of k, given by Λx = ℓxt cos kxℓx 2  h 1 + ζ cos (kyℓy) i , (21) Λy = −2ℓyt′ sin kxℓx 2  sin (kyℓy) . (22)5 FIG. 2.

(a) The numerical (blue solid line) and analytic (black dashed line) results of the intraband plasmon branch along x direction.
The SPE continuum is marked by the green colored region.
(b) Plot of the energy loss function, which shows ω ∼√q behavior.
In (a) and (b), we set EF = 0.
(c) Angular de- pendence of ω with a ﬁxed q = 0.13/ℓx and EF = 0.5t. (d) Plasmon frequency as a function of Fermi level EF with a ﬁxed q = 0.13/ℓx.
In these ﬁgures, ω, qx, and EF are plotted in unit of t/ℏ, ℓ−1 x , and t, respectively.
And model parameters are the same as in Fig. 1(c,d).
It follows that the SPE continuum evolves from a line in t′ = 0 limit to a fan shaped region for t′ ̸= 0 in the (q, ω) space, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The real part of χintra 0 can be obtained as Re χintra 0 ≈g vF πℏℓy 1 ω2  q2 x −1 4ζ2  q2 x −2k2 F ℓ2 yq2 y  .
(23) Then, the dispersion of long-wavelength intraband plas- mons in the presence of interchain coupling is ωq = r 2grs ΩvF p ℓxq  1 −1 4ζ2  cos2 θq +1 2ζ2k2 F ℓ2 y sin2 θq 1/2 .
(24) One can see that the interchain coupling (nonzero ζ) gives a correction to the dispersion.
In the limit of ζ →0, this expression reduces to Eq. (17), as expected.
The previ- ously noted features, including the √q dependence, the strong anisotropy, and the quantum character (involving ℏexplicitly) are maintained after including the interchain coupling.
The strongest dispersion of these plasmons is still along the x direction, i.e., the direction normal to the nodal line.
Along this direction, θq = 0 and we have ωq = s 2grs Ω  1 −1 4ζ2  vF p ℓxq, (25) which is still independent of the carrier density n.
The interchain coupling only gives a small correction to the frequency.
Meanwhile, for plasmons propagating along the direction of nodal line, i.e, θq = π/2, we have ωq = √grsζvF kF p ℓyq.
(26) Therefore, with the interchain coupling, the intraband plasmons in this direction acquire ﬁnite frequency.
More- over, due to the kF factor, the plasmon frequency scales linearly with n (or EF ).
In other words, at ﬁnite in- terchain coupling, there is a crossover in the scaling of intraband plasmon frequency from ω ∼n0 to ω ∼n, when θq varies from 0 to π/2.
Such a crossover behavior clearly reﬂects the strong anisotropy of the nonsymmor- phic nodal line.
These features are veriﬁed by our numerical calcula- tions on the Dirac SSH model.
In the calculation, the plasmon modes are extract from the peaks of the energy loss function L (q, ω) = Im  − 1 ε (q, ω)  .
(27) As shown in Fig. 2(a), the result from the numerical cal- culation agrees very well with the analytic formula (24).
The plasmons are quite separated from the SPE contin- uum which only spans a small region.
In Fig. 2(b), we plot the frequency versus q1/2, so that one can clearly see the ω ∼q1/2 dispersion.
Figure 2(c) shows the angu- lar dependence of plasma frequency at a ﬁx wave vector magnitude.
The frequency is maximum at direction nor- mal to the nodal line and is minimum along the nodal line, reﬂecting the strong anisotropy of the system.
Fi- nally, in Fig. 2(d), we plot ω as a function of EF for diﬀerent propagation directions, which conﬁrms the scal- ing behavior discussed above.
B. Interband plasmons From the overlap form factor in (18), we notice that along the x direction, only intraband plasmons exist.
However, for other directions, especially the y direction, interband contributions with s ̸= s′ can exist when there is nonzero interchain coupling t′. For these interband modes, χ0 may involve virtual transitions between states away from the nodal line, so it is diﬃcult to get simple analytic result.
In the following, we shall proceed with numerical calculation of the Dirac SSH model.
Figure 3(a) shows the obtained energy loss function for q along the nodal-line (y) direction, where such inter- band plasmons are most pronounced.
One observes that besides the gapless intraband branch at low frequencies,6 FIG.
3. (a) Plasmon spectrum along the nodal line.
The two upper branches are the interband plasmons.
(b) The two fre- quencies ω1 and ω2 associated with the van Hove singularities at Y and Γ are marked by the red arrows.
(c) Joint density of states (JDOS) of the model.
The two frequencies manifest as singularities in the plot.
In (a-c), the model parameters are the same as in Fig. 1(c,d) (with ζ = 0.3).
qy and JDOS are plotted in units of ℓ−1 y and 1/(Ωt).
(d) is the same as panel (a) but with a smaller interchain coupling ζ = 0.1.
there are two other gapped branches at much higher fre- quencies.
They correspond to the interband plasmons.
As we mentioned, these interband modes are related to interband virtual transitions in the band structure.
Ac- tually, one can see that the long wavelength limit of the two branches encode the information of the van Hove sin- gularities of the Dirac SSH band structure.
As indicated in Fig. 3(b), in the q →0 limit, the virtual transitions are vertical, and there are two dominant frequencies ω1 and ω2 corresponding to the van Hove singularities at Y and Γ of BZ.
It is more convenient to visualize these two frequencies as corresponding to the singularities in the joint density of states (JDOS), as shown in Fig 3(c).
In the plasmon spectrum, ω1 and ω2 are exactly the limit- ing values of the two interband branches in the q →0 limit.
(Here, the intensity of the peak vanishes, because the form factor is zero in this limit.) With increasing q, the frequency of the upper branch decreases and the lower branch increases, and the two merge at q = π/ℓy, corresponding to the interband transitions from Γ to Y or from Y to Γ, owing to the particle-hole symmetry of the model.
Another feature to be noted is that the band width of these two interband branches is on the order of interchain coupling t′.
This can be easily understood by noting that this width scales with the electronic band energy variation along ky which is governed by t′. In Fig. 3(d), we plot the plasmon spectrum at a decreased value of t′ FIG.

MATERIAL RESULT We have studied the plasmonic properties of 2D Dirac SSH model.
In this section, we shall see whether these properties can manifest in the real material system, i.e., the monolayer NbSixTe2 family materials.
Figures 4(b-c) show the crystal structure of Nb3SiTe6 (i.e., x = 1/3).
The structure consists of three atomic layers.
The Nb and Si atoms form the middle layer, which are sandwiched by two layers of Te atoms.
Within the 2D plane, the structure can be viewed as constructed by three basic building blocks, which are conventionally named as a, b, and c chains, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a).
a and b chains contain Si atoms, and they share the same composition of NbSi1/2Te2.
In comparison, the c chain does not contain Si, so it has a composition of NbTe2.
a and b chains are connected by the glide mirror sym- metry ˜ My, and they always stick together.
In terms of these building blocks, Nb3SiTe6 in Fig. 4(c) has the con- ﬁguration of (ab)1c.
Other members of the NbSixTe2 family are obtained by repeating more (ab) chain units between the c chains, so they have the general conﬁgura- tion of (ab)nc [34], as shown in Fig. 4(d).
In this picture,7 FIG.

(b-d) Band structures of (Nb2SiTe4)n(NbTe2) with n = 1, 2, 3.
their general chemical formula may also be written as (Nb2SiTe4)n(NbTe2).
We perform ﬁrst-principles calculations on the three member materials with n = 1, 2, 3.
The calculation method is given in Appendix.
Previous works showed that the spin-orbit coupling is weak in these materi- als [33, 34, 36], so it is neglected in our calculation.
The obtained band structures are plotted in Fig. 5, which agree with previous results [34].
One observes that the three band structures share similar features, with a non- symmorphic nodal line close to the Fermi level on the X-M path, formed by the crossing of two bands.
Previ- ous studies showed that the low-energy states are mainly from the c chains [34, 35].
The intrachain coupling is strong, making sizable dispersion along the x direction (along the chain).
The interchain coupling is relatively weak and it naturally decreases with increasing n. Based on the ﬁrst-principles band structures, we com- pute their plasmon spectra in RPA.
First, consider the plasmon dispersion along x, i.e., the direction normal to the nodal line.
The results are plotted (versus q1/2) in Fig. 6.
One can see that there is a single gapless branch with ω ∼q1/2 in this direction, representing the intra- band plasmons, consistent with our model result in Fig. 2.
The plasmon peaks in Fig. 6(e,f) are quite sharp, indi- cating their weak Landau damping and long lifetime.
In- deed, our calculation shows that the SPE continuum for n = 2 or 3 is far separated from the plasmon branch.
In comparison, the plasmon peaks for n = 1 are smeared out for ℏω above 50 meV [Fig. 6(d)].
This is due to the overlap with the SPE region [see Fig. 6(a)].
The SPE con- tinuum for n = 1 spans a much larger region, because the material’s band structure has a stronger deviation from the Dirac SSH model, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 5(b). FIG.

The SPE regions are marked by the green color.
(d-f) show the plot of energy loss function in this direction and the plot is versus √q to explicitly show the scaling.
We take EF = 0 (i.e., undoped case) in these calculations.
In Fig. 7(a), we show the variation of the intraband plasmon frequency with Fermi energy.
One observes that at a ﬁxed wave vector qx, the frequencies are almost in- dependent of EF , which conﬁrms the scaling behavior we ﬁnd in the model study.
In Fig. 7(b) , we plot the angular dependence of intra- band plasmons, showing a behavior consistent with the model result in Fig. 2(c).
It conﬁrms that the dispersion is strongest along x (i.e., normal to the nodal line) and is suppressed along y (parallel to the nodal line).
Next, we plot the plasmon spectra along the y direc- tion in Fig. 7(c).
One observes that besides the intra- band plasmon branch at low frequency (which are almost entirely suppressed for n = 2, 3, indicating their very small interchain coupling), there are interband branches at higher frequencies.
This agrees with the model result.
Nevertheless, there appear to be more than two inter- band branches, especially for n = 2 and 3.
This is due to the presence of other nearby bands in Fig. 5, which also contribute to the interband transitions. Consistent8 FIG.
7. (a) Frequency of intraband plasmon in NbSixTe2 as a function of Fermi level EF .
Here, q = 0.02 ˚A−1 and θq = 0.
(b) Angular dependence of the intraband plasmons with a ﬁxed q = 0.02 ˚A−1.
Here, we set EF = −50 meV. (c) Plasmon spectra along y direction for n = 1, 2, 3 cases.
We set EF = 0 and the qy is in unit of 2πℓ−1 y .
with our model analysis, one can see that the width of the interband branches decreases with n. For n = 2 and 3, these branches become very ﬂat, again reﬂecting the weak interchain coupling.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We have discussed the distinct features of plasmons in the class of nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
The ex- ample materials used in our study, namely the NbSixTe2 family materials, already exist.
Their high-quality 2D ul- trathin layers have been demonstrated in experiment [38].
In addition, there exist several other isostructural materi- als, including TaSixTe2, NbGexTe2, and TaGexTe2, with the similar nodal-line band structure [31, 40, 41].
We ex- pect our theory can be readily tested in these materials.
As for probing the plasmon excitations, there are sev- eral established experimental techniques, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [59, 60], inelastic helium atom scattering, and transmission electron microscopy.
Particularly, the high-resolution EELS provides a power- ful tool for mapping out the plasmon spectrum.
It was demonstrated that the technique can reach a resolution of a few meV and the detected frequency range can reach ∼1 eV [60, 61].
Hence, our predicted features in 2D FIG. 8.
Screening charge density δn(r) induced by a charge impurity at the origin.
(a) ζ = 0 and (b) ζ = 0.3.
Here, x and y are plotted in unit of ℓx and ℓy.
The model parameters are the same as in Fig. 1(c,d) and we take EF = 50 meV. NbSixTe2 should be easily detectable in experiment.
In addition, we mention that besides plasmons, the unusual dielectric function for nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs may also manifest in the screening charge distribu- tion induced by a charge impurity.
Consider a charge im- purity next in a 2D system.
Its induced screening charge density δn can be expressed as δn(r) = Z dq (2π)2 h 1 ε(q, 0) −1 i next(q)eiq·r.
(28) For usual 2D electron gas, the induced charge den- sity δn exhibits the well-known Friedel oscillation, with δn(r) ∼cos(2kF r)/r2.
The oscillation wave vector 2kF arises from the singularity in the static dielectric func- tion ε(q, 0).
Now, consider the Dirac SSH model.
For the t′ →0 limit, the Fermi surface (at EF ̸= 0) are given by two straight lines parallel to the nodal line.
From Eq. (15), singularities in ε(q, 0) arise only from the nest- ing vector restricted to each piece of the Fermi surface.
Importantly, the special Fermi surface here gives not one but a continuum of nesting wave vectors qˆy along the y direction.
After Fourier transform to real space, the in- duced charge density should exhibit peaks on a straight line along x through the charge impurity, as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Increasing t′ to a nonzero but small value, we ﬁnd that the distribution of singular wave vectors evolve from a single line to two lines forming a cross at q = 0.
Accordingly, the screening charge density peaks also transform from the horizontal line in Fig. 8(a) to two almost straight lines through the charge impurity as in Fig. 8(b).
In conclusion, we discover interesting plasmon proper- ties in a class of 2D nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs.
Using the Dirac SSH model, we show that the system possess two kinds of plasmons: the gapless intraband plasmons and the gapped interband plasmons.
The in- traband plasmons has a q1/2 dependence.
The disper- sion and the carrier density scaling are highly anisotropic.
Normal to the nodal line, the dispersion is strongest and is independent of carrier density; whereas along the nodal line, the dispersion is largely suppressed and is linear in the carrier density.
The interband plasmons have a quite ﬂat dispersion, with band width scaling with the inter-9 chain coupling.
Their long wavelength limits are con- nected with transitions between van Hove singularities of the band structure.
Most these plasmons are separated from the SPE continuum, so they should have a weak Landau damping.
The revealed features are also veriﬁed in the NbSixTe2 family materials via ﬁrst-principles cal- culations.
Our work reveals new physical consequences of a topological state of matter.
The predicted physics will also motivate further studies on 2D nonsymmorphic nodal-line TSMs and on NbSixTe2 family materials.

Appendix A: Calculation method The electronic structures of the NbSixTe2 were cal- culated based on the density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package [62–64].
The ionic potentials were treated with the projector augmented way pseudopotentials [65], with 4p65s14d4, 3s23p2, and 5s25p4 valence electron conﬁgurations for Nb, Si, and Te atoms, respectively.
The exchange- correlation energy was treated with the generalized gra- dient approximation [66] in the scheme of Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE) [67] approach.
The plane wave cutoﬀ energy was set to be 400 eV and the convergence thresh- olds for energy and force were chosen to be 10−7 eV and 0.001 eV/˚A, respectively.
Γ-centered k-points meshes with size 10 × 6 × 1 for (ab)1c and 10 × 4 × 1 for (ab)2c and (ab)3c were used for BZ sampling.
After obtaining the band structure, ab-initio tight-binding models were constructed by using the WANNIER90 package [68].
The p orbitals of Te atoms and d orbitals of Nb atoms were used as initial input of local basis.
The Wannier model were used to calculate the dynamical dielectric function in RPA.
