Measurement of spin mixing conductance in Ni81Fe19/α-W and Ni81Fe19/β-W heterostrucutures via ferromagnetic resonance W. Cao,1, a) J. Liu,1 A. Zangiabadi,1 K. Barmak,1 and W. E. Bailey1, b) Materials Science and Engineering, Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA We present measurements of interfacial Gilbert damping due to the spin pumping eﬀect in Ni81Fe19/W heterostructures.
Measurements were compared for heterostruc- tures in which the crystallographic phase of W, either α(bcc)-W or β(A15)-W, was en- riched through deposition conditions and characterized using X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR-XTEM).
Single phase Ni81Fe19/α-W heterostructures could be realized, but heterostructures with β-W were realized as mixed α-β phase.
The spin mixing conductances (SMC) for W at interfaces with Ni81Fe19 were found to be signiﬁcantly lower than those for similarly heavy metals such as Pd and Pt, but comparable to those for Ta, and independent of enrichment in the β phase.

INTRODUCTION The heavy metals Ta, W and Pt have drawn attention as charge-to-spin-current- converters using spin Hall and related eﬀects1–4.
Beta phase W, β-W, with the topologically close-packed A15 structure5, possesses a “giant” spin Hall angle of θSH ≈0.3–0.43,6.
The spin transport properties of β-W, such as the spin Hall angle θSH and spin diﬀusion length λSD, have been characterized by diﬀerent methods3,6–8.
In these studies, the metastable β-W layers were deposited directly on the substrate, were only stable for small W thickness, and were presumably stabilized through residual water vapor or oxygen on the substrate surface; thicker W ﬁlms typically revert to the stable (bcc) α phase.
Recently, some of us9–11 have optimized a diﬀerent method to stabilize the metastable- β-phase, using the introduction of N2 gas12 while sputtering at low power.
Relatively thick (over 100 nm) monophase β-W ﬁlms could be stabilized this way, when deposited on glass substrates.
This technique has allowed deposition of majority β phase W for 14 nm W ﬁlms on CoFeB, as CoFeB/W(14 nm), and of minority β phase for 14 nm W ﬁlms on Ni and Ni81Fe19 (“Py”), as Ni/W(14 nm) and Py/W(14 nm).
In the present work, we have prepared both monophase Py/α-W (here Py/“α”-W) and mixed phase Py/(α+β)- W (here Py/“β”-W) heterostructures using our optimized sputtering technique to enrich the fraction of β-W. Crystallographic phases of W were characterized by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD), and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR-XTEM); secondary structural information was provided by electrical resistivity measurements at room temperature.
We note that our measurements cannot distinguish between purely metallic, A15 β-W and A15 W oxide or nitride (e.g. W3O); the identity of β-W as a purely metallic phase or a compound is a longstanding controversy12,13.
In ferromagnet (FM)/normal metal (NM) heterostructures, pure (chargeless) spin cur- rents can be injected from the FM into the NM by exciting ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in the FM layer, “pumping” out spin current14,15.
If the spin current is absorbed in the NM layer, the inﬂuence of “spin pumping” can be observed through the increase in the linewidth of the resonance, proportional to frequency ω as Gilbert damping, due to the loss of angular momentum from the precessing spin system14,15.
The eﬃciency of the spin pumping eﬀect for a given interface is characterized through the spin mixing conductance (SMC) g↑↓ FM/NM.
The SMC is also an important parameter for the interpretation of inverse 2spin Hall eﬀect (ISHE) measurements4,16, in which the spin Hall angle θSH is measured by pumping chargeless spin current into the NM by FMR and measuring spin-to-charge current conversion through the generated charge current.
Measurements of spin mixing conductance for Py/α-W and Py/β-W have not been reported previously, although some measurements have been reported for W oxide8.
For these measurements, the simplest way to isolate the contribution of the FM/NM interface to the damping, and thus the spin pumping eﬀect and spin mixing conductance g↑↓ FM/NM, is to deposit the FM on the bottom and the NM on top, so that comparison structures without the NM layer have nearly identical microstructure.
The ability to deposit enriched β-W on Py rather than on an insulating substrate is thus im- portant for the measurement of spin mixing conductance of Py/β-W.
In this manuscript, we report measurements of spin mixing conductances for Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W interfaces using variable-frequency, swept-ﬁeld FMR, as in our previous work17–19. II.
SAMPLE PREPARATION Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) magnetron sputtering was used to deposit substrate/Ta(5 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Ni81Fe19 (Py)/W/Cu(5 nm)/Ta(5 nm) heterostructures on both oxidized Si and glass substrates at room temperature, with base pressure better than 2 × 10−8 Torr.
The samples consist of two thickness series in “α”-W and “β”-W for a total of four se- ries.
In the ﬁrst thickness series, the thickness of Py (tPy = 5 nm) was ﬁxed and the thickness of W was varied, with tW = 2, 5, 10, 30 nm, for both “α”-optimized and “β”- optimized conditions.
This thickness series was used for resistivity measurements, X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) (tW = 10, 30 nm), high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (HR-XTEM) (tW = 30 nm) and FMR characterization.
In the second thickness series, the thickness of W (tW = 10 nm) was ﬁxed and the thickness of Py was varied, with tPy = 3, 5, 10, 20 nm, also for both “α” and “β’ conditions.
This thickness series was used only for FMR characterization.
The same stacks without W layers, Py(3, 5, 10, 20 nm), were deposited as reference samples for FMR measurements.
One heterostructure with re- verse depostion order, “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm), was deposited in the absence of N2 gas and characterized by XRD and FMR; this was not possible for “β”-W because the β phase cannot be stabilized on Cu underlayers10.
The W layers in all samples were deposited with 10 W power, nearly constant deposition 3rate (< 0.1 ˚A/s), and Ar pressure of 3 × 10−3 Torr.
Nitrogen gas, with 1.2 × 10−5 Torr pressure measured by a residual gas analyzer, was introduced to promote the growth of β phase W10. III.
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION Crystalline phases of W in the Py/W heterostructures were characterized primarily by XRD (Section A), with supporting measurements by HR-XTEM (Section B), and ﬁnally with some indirect evidence in room-temperature electrical resistivity measurements (Section C).
Our basic ﬁndings are that ﬁlms deposited without N2, optimized for “α”-W, are nearly single-phase α in Py/“α”-W, while in the Py/“β”-W optimized heterostructures, deposited in the presence of N2, the W layers are mixed α+β phase, with a roughly 50%–50% mixture of α-W and β-W averaged over a 10 nm ﬁlm.
The phase composition within the ﬁrst 5 nm of the interface may have a slightly greater fraction of α-W, but β-W could be positively identiﬁed here as well.
A. X-ray diﬀraction Both symmetric (θ-2θ) and grazing-incidence, ﬁxed sample angle X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) scans were carried out on Py(5 nm)/W(10 nm) and Py(5 nm)/W(30 nm) heterostructures deposited on glass substrates.
The scans are compared for “α”-W and “β”-W depositions.
Scans were recorded using Cu Kα radiation and a commercial diﬀractometer.
The symmetric (θ-2θ) scans, with scattering vector perpendicular to ﬁlm planes, are presented ﬁrst.
We point out some obvious features of the symmetric XRD spectra, shown in Figures 1a) and 1b).
For the Py/“α”-W(30 nm) ﬁlm in Fig. 1a), all peaks can be indexed to the close-packed planes, Cu(111)/Py(111) (fcc) and α-W(110) (bcc).
The small peak at 2θ = 36◦can be indexed to the reﬂection of a small amount of Cu Kβ radiation from α-W(110).
Moving to the thinner α phase ﬁlm in Fig. 1b), Py/“α”-W(10 nm), it is still the case that all reﬂections can be indexed to the close-packed Cu(111)/Py(111) and α- W(110) planes.
However, there is greater structure in these reﬂections, presumably due to ﬁnite-size oscillations (Laue satellites), expected to be more evident in thinner ﬁlms.
Nearly identical spectra are recorded for the 10 nm “α”-W ﬁlms regardless of deposition order: 4Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm) and “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) ﬁlms scatter X-rays very similarly, as shown in Fig. 1b).
We should note that Cu deposited on Ta has strong {111} texture in our ﬁlms.
Py (Ni81Fe19) deposited on Cu also has strong {111} texture; growth of Py on Cu and vice-versa is found to be largely coherent within grains.
Both layers are fcc with similar lattice parameters: aCu ≈3.61 ˚A for Cu10,20 and aPy ≈3.55 ˚A for Py10,21, with a small misﬁt strain of ϵ = |aCu −aPy|/aCu ≈2%.
The XRD peaks for (111)-reﬂections in bulk phases, broadened by ﬁnite-size eﬀects (FWHM ≈1.7◦for 5 nm ﬁlms, using the Scherrer equation22,23), are very close to each other, at 44.2◦(Py) and 43.4◦(Cu) respectively, so we expect (and have observed) one averaged peak for Cu and Py.
The nominal “β”-W ﬁlms (red lines) clearly show the presence of the β phase through the unique β-W(200) reﬂection at 2θ ≃36◦.
This unique reﬂection is very strong in the “β”- W(30 nm) heterostructure (Fig. 1a) but weaker as a proportion of the total intensity in the thinner “β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure (Fig. 1b).
In Fig. 1a), experimental β-W(200) and β-W(210) reﬂections have intensities in a ratio similar to the theoretical scattering intensity ratios for randomly-oriented β grains.
This is not the case for the thinner “β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure in Fig. 1b); here the unique β-W(200) peak is less intense than expected.
We interpret the relative weakness of β(200) as the presence of a large fraction of α grains in the nominal Py/“β”-W(10 nm) heterostructure.
In order to quantify the amount of α-W in the nominal “β”-W ﬁlm, we have carried out grazing incidence measurements of Py(5 nm)/W(10 nm) samples (20◦≤2θ ≤100◦) on the same diﬀractometer, as illustrated in Fig. 1c).
The samples were measured at a ﬁxed source position of 5◦with 0.1◦step size, 0.25◦ﬁxed slit and the 15 mm beam mask.
From the TEM measurements in Fig. 2b), we ﬁnd that the deposited “α”-W ﬁlms have {110} texture, i.e., the hexagonal arrangement (60◦angles) of the {011} α-W reﬂections away from the surface normal.
Thus with the grazing incidence geometry, in which the scattering vector does not remain perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane, the relative intensities of the peaks will not match theoretical calculations (vertical lines) based on randomly-oriented, untextured ﬁlms.
For example, the α-W(200) peak (blue, ∼58◦in 2θ) almost vanishes in the XRD scan here, due to the {011}α-W texture.
Here we focus on the α-W(211) peaks near 2θ = 72◦, observed in both Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W samples.
As shown in the Fig. 1c) inset, the α-W(211) peaks (60◦≤2θ ≤85◦), were ﬁtted as the sum of Lorentzian peak and identical background, assumed quadratic in 52θ, for both Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W samples.
First we ﬁt the α-W(211) peak (blue) in the Py/“α”-W sample to the summed function to determine the Lorentzian peak and quadratic background parameters.
Next, we use this ﬁtted background in the ﬁt to the α-W(211) peak (red) in the Py/“β”-W sample.
The two ﬁtted α-W(211) peaks are shown as blue (for Py/“α”-W) and red (for Py/“β”-W) dashed lines in the Fig. 1c) inset.
The ﬁts reproduce the experimental data well in the ﬁtted region.
The integrated α-W(211) peak (i.e., the 2θ-integrated area between the measured data and the ﬁtted background) for the Py/“β”-W sample has roughly half the intensity of the integrated peak for the Py/“α”-W sample.
Assuming that the nominal α-W is 100% α phase and that the α grains in mixed phase “β”-W have similar {110} texture, as is supported by the HR-XTEM measurements in Figures 2 and 3, we conclude that the Py/“β”-W(10 nm) ﬁlm is roughly 50% α-W and 50% β-W. B. Transmission electron microscopy The phases of the nominal Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(30 nm) and the nominal Py(5 nm)/“β”- W(30 nm) samples deposited on oxidized Si substrates were characterized in high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, selected-area diﬀraction, and focused-beam nanodiﬀraction, by transmission electron microscopy (for details see the endnote1).
Fig. 2 shows a cross-sectional image and diﬀraction pattern for the nominal Py/“α”- W(30 nm) heterostructure.
First, one can see from the mass contrast between W and the 3d transition metal elements (Ni, Fe, Cu) that the Py/W and W/Cu interfaces are relatively ﬂat and sharp on the scale of the image resolution of ∼3 nm, presumably broadened by topographic variation through the thickness of the TEM foil.
Second, based on (less pronounced) diﬀraction contrast parallel to the interface, the grains appear to be columnar, in many cases extending through the ﬁlm thickness, with an average (lateral) grain diameter of 10–20 nm.
The selected-area diﬀraction (SAD) pattern can be indexed according to unique (111)Py//(011)α-W ﬁber texture, as shown by the hexagonal arrangement (60◦angles) of the {011} reﬂections in α-W, and the arrangement of {111} reﬂections in Py, ∼70.5◦away from the (vertical) ﬁber axis.
The calculated diﬀraction spots based on {111}Py//{011}α- W ﬁber texture with ∞-fold rotational symmetry about the ﬁlm-normal axis are shown in Fig. 2 b), inset; good agreement is found.
6Cross-sectional images and diﬀraction patterns for the Py/“β”-W(30 nm) heterostructure are shown in Fig. 3. Here again, in Fig. 3 a), the mass contrast shows similarly well- deﬁned interfaces, but the topographic variations have a shorter wavelength, due presumably to smaller, more equiaxed grains in the mixed-phase “β”-W. Circles indicate areas where convergent nanobeam electron diﬀraction (CBED) patterns were taken.
The diﬀraction patterns over these small regions can be indexed to single phases: fcc Ni81Fe19 (Py) in green, bcc α-W in blue, and A15 β-W in red.
The CBED patterns in Fig. 3 a) conﬁrm that the nominal “β”-W ﬁlm is mixed-phase α-W and β-W.
The critical question for distinguishing the spin mixing conductances of α-W and β-W in Py/W is the identity of the W phase located within the ﬁrst several nanometers of the interface with Py: the pumped spin current is ejected through the interface and absorbed over this region; see the x-axis of Fig. 6.
We have addressed this question locally using high resolution imaging (see Fig. 3 b) and over a larger area using frequency analysis (see Fig. 3 c) of the image, roughly equivalent to SAD.
In Fig. 3 b), a 10 nm area (red box) shows what appears to be a single-crystal region with (1¯11)[110]Py//(011)[1¯11]α-W//(002)[200]β-W, indicating that the β crystals may nucleate on top of the α crystals; however, this is contrary to our previous observations10 and not distinguishable in the image from the superposition of grains through the foil, with nucleation of β at the Py/W interface.
The discrete spatial Fourier transform (FT) of this region shows that the four vertically/horizontally circled β- W{002} spots are similar in intensity to the six α-W{011} spots, supporting a similar β-W content in this region.
Carrying out a spatial FT of the full selected region within 5 nm of the interface (dotted box) in Fig. 3 a) , we can conﬁrm that β-W is indeed present adjacent to the interface, as indicated by the β-W{002} FT spots in Fig. 3 c), although these appear to be somewhat less intense than the α-W{011} spots.
C. Resistivity Four-point probe van der Pauw resistivity measurements were performed at room tem- perature on the ﬁrst thickness series of samples (tPy = 5 nm ﬁxed, variable tW) deposited on 25 × 25 mm square glass substrates, i.e., glass substrate/Ta(5 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Py(5 nm)/W(tW)/Cu(5 nm)/Ta(5 nm).
Two point probes for current and two point probes for voltage were placed at the four corners of the square coupons.
For square samples, the 7voltage-to-current ratios were converted to resistance per square using the known geomet- rical factor π/ ln 2 ≈4.5324.
To isolate the W resistances, we plot the thickness-dependent sheet conductance and ﬁt according to: 1 Rtotal = Gtotal = G0 + 4.53 ρW tW (1) where Rtotal (Gtotal) is the total resistance (conductance) of the sample, ρW and tW are the resistivity and the thickness of the W layer, and G0 is the parallel conductance of other layers in the stack.
We have veriﬁed Ohmic response by ﬁtting the proportional dependence of voltage V on current I over the range 2 mA ≤I ≤10 mA for each sample.
Fig. 4 summarizes the total conductance Gtotal = 1/Rtotal as a function of W thickness tW for all Py(5 nm)/W(tW) heterostructures.
Solid lines represent linear ﬁts for the W resistivity ρW, assumed constant as a function of W thickness for “α”-W and “β”-W samples.
The extracted resistivity for “α” phase W ρα is found to be ∼35 µΩcm and for “β” phase W ρβ ∼148 µΩcm.
The resistivity for “β”-W more than four times greater than that for “α”-W, is due in large part to the much smaller grain size for β-W and is typically observed in prior studies25.
Here the resistivity for “α-W” is larger by a factor of 2–3 than ﬁlms deposited at room temperature and postannealed in previous work26, also attributable to a smaller grain size in these ﬁlms deposited at ambient temperature.
The resistivity measurements for these thin ﬁlms might be taken as indirect evidence for the presence of the β phase in the nominal “β”-W layers. IV.
FERROMAGNETIC RESONANCE MEASUREMENTS The four thickness series of Py(tPy)/W(tW) ﬁlms, for “α”-W and “β”-W, as described in Section II were characterized using variable-frequency ﬁeld-swept FMR using a coplanar waveguide (CPW) with center conductor width of 300 µm.
The bias magnetic ﬁeld was applied in the ﬁlm plane (pc-FMR, or parallel condition).
For details, see e.g., our prior work in Ref. [20].
Fig. 5 summarizes half-power FMR linewidth ∆H1/2 as a function of frequency ω/2π for Py(5 nm), Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(10 nm) samples.
The mea- surements were taken at frequencies from 3 GHz to above 20 GHz.
Solid lines are linear regression of the variable-frequency FMR linewidth ∆H1/2 = ∆H0 + 2αω/γ, where ∆H1/2 8is the full-width at half-maximum, ∆H0 is the inhomogeneous broadening, α is the Gilbert damping, ω is the resonance frequency and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.
Good linear ﬁts were obtained with resonance frequency ω/2π for experimental linewidths ∆H1/2(ω) of all the samples measured.
For the ﬁrst sample thickness series Py(5 nm)/W(tW), we plot damping parameters α extracted from the linear ﬁts, as a function of W thickness in Fig. 6.
Standard deviation errors in the ﬁt for α are ∼2×10−4.
The Gilbert damping α saturates quickly as a function of tW for both “α”-W and “β”-W, with almost all of the eﬀect realized with the ﬁrst 2 nm of W. Loosely speaking, this fast saturation implies a short spin diﬀusion length λSD ≤2 nm, so the identity of the W phase (α or β) over this length scale near the interface is most relevant.
The averaged damping, αPy/“α”−W and αPy/“β”−W, are shown as horizontal dashed lines in the ﬁgure.
αPy/“α”−W is slightly smaller than αPy/“β”−W, but this may be within experimental error.
Due to spin pumping, the damping is enhanced with the addition of W layers ∆α = αPy/W −αPy, normalized to the Gilbert damping αPy of the reference sample without W layers.
The eﬀective SMC g↑↓ eff at the Py/W interfaces can be calculated following: ∆α = γ¯hg↑↓ eff (4πMS)tPy (2) where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, ¯h is the reduced Planck constant, and 4πMS ≈10 kG is the saturation inductance of Py.
In this series of samples, the eﬀective SMC at the Py/“α”-W interface g↑↓ Py/“α”−W ≈7.2 ± 0.3 nm−2 and the eﬀective SMC at the Py/“β”- W interface g↑↓ Py/“β”−W ≈7.4 ± 0.2 nm−2.
These values are signiﬁcantly lower than those reported in Ref.8 for CoFeB/W (20–30 nm−2), as measured by spin-torque FMR.
For the second sample thickness series Py(tPy)/W(10 nm), we plot the extracted Gilbert damping α and damping enhancement ∆α = αPy/W −αPy as a function of Py thickness in Fig. 7.
The enhanced damping is normalized to the Gilbert damping αPy of reference samples with the same Py thickness tPy.
The result is in good agreement with the inverse thickness dependence of contributed damping predicted from Equation 2.
The experimental data is ﬁtted with Equation 2 to extract the eﬀective SMC.
In this series of samples, the eﬀective SMC at the Py/“α”-W interface g↑↓ Py/“α”−W ≈6.7±0.1 nm−2 and the eﬀective SMC at the Py/“β”-W interface g↑↓ Py/“β”−W ≈7.4 ± 0.3 nm−2.
Previous studies on W have shown that the formation of α-W is preferred, for thicker 9W layers (e.g. 10 nm)3,26.
We also prepared the sample “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) with reverse deposition order, with the same seed and cap layers, on an oxidized Si substrate.
Here the top surface of the 10 nm thick α-W layer is pure α phase, as shown by XRD in Fig. 1 a).
We performed the same FMR measurement on the reverse order sample; its Gilbert damping enhancement ∆α is plotted as the green dot in Fig. 7.
This point almost overlaps with the measurement for the normal order sample Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm), indirectly supporting the conclusion that the phase of the Py/“α”-W interface is similar to the phase of the “α”-W/Py interface, i.e., almost 100% α phase W. Note that it was not possible to deposit a reverse-order β phase sample because no β phase W could be stabilized on Cu using our technique10.
The FMR measurements of spin mixing conductance g↑↓for Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W are new in this study.
We ﬁnd that the value is similar to that measured for Ta27 (g↑↓∼ 10 nm−2) regardless of the enriched phase.
First-principles-based calculations including relativistic eﬀects28 for g↑↓at Py/NM interfaces have shown that Ta, next to W in the periodic table, is a good spin sink due to its large spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but has a relatively small g↑↓∼8–9 nm−2.
The eﬃcient absorption of spin current can be connected with a large SOC from the large atomic number, and the low SMC can be connected to relatively poor band matching across the Py/W interface, compared with that for Py/Cu or Py/Pt28.
The conclusion for Ta is consistent with our experimental results for the Py/W system, i.e., the rapid saturation of Gilbert damping within the ﬁrst 2 nm of W, indicating W is also a good spin sink, with a similarly low g↑↓∼7 nm−2.
V. DISCUSSION We have found very little diﬀerence between the spin scattering properties (spin mixing conductance and spin diﬀusion length) of α-W and mixed phase (α+β)-W. The simplest interpretation is that both spin mixing conductances and spin diﬀusion lengths are nearly equal for the two phases.
However, despite our development of an optimized technique9–11 to stabilize the β phase, our control over the amounts of deposited α and β phases is less than complete, particularly near the Py/W interface.
The “α”-structure we deposited, Py/α-W, is nearly ∼100% α phase.
We observed no strong β-W peaks in the XRD scans, and neither crystalline structure nor diﬀraction patterns 10for the β phase in HR-XTEM characterization.
According to our previous work10,26,29, we know that ionically and covalently bonded substrates/underlayers are favorable for the formation of some β-W, whereas metallic underlayers promote α, so on Py even at a thickness of 2 nm, the nominally α-W ﬁlm is fully α if deposited in the absence of nitrogen.
In the thinnest “β”-structure which we can characterize by XRD, Py/“β”-W(10 nm), we identify a roughly 50%-50% mixture of α and β phases.
If this balance persists at the interface as well, the SMC cannot diﬀer by more than 10-20% for the two phases.
While the measurement of the 5 nm region near the interface seems to show somewhat less than 50% β phase, there is still a substantial population of β-W in this region, and it would seem that a strong diﬀerence in SMC for α-W and β-W should be resolvable if present.
Given that the measured values are very similar, we conclude that the α and β phases do not diﬀer strongly in this spin transport study.
One might ask why the spin mixing conductance, in contrast to the spin Hall angle3, does not diﬀer much for the two phases of W. The spin mixing conductance (SMC) g↑↓ FM/NM is a property of the FM/NM interface, rather than a bulk property of the NM layer.
The SMC may be approximated (in a single-band, free-electron model) as g↑↓≈κk2 FA/4π2, where kF is the Fermi wave number for the NM, κ represents the number of scattering channels in units of one channel per interface atom, and A is the total surface area of the interface30.
Despite the possibility that bulk β-W has a stronger eﬀective spin-orbit coupling and spin Hall eﬀect due to its A15 structure, β-W could have similar numbers of conducting channels per atom at the FM/NM interface as α-W, which could lead to the similar values of SMC measured here.
Another possibility is that the spin diﬀusion length λSD may vary along the W layer thickness, due to nonuniformly distributed α-W and β-W phases in “β”-W samples.
If this is true, ﬁtting a single spin diﬀusion length for spin pumping into very thin W layers will be problematic31.
However, because we have observed a very rapid saturation of Gilbert damping over the ﬁrst 2 nm of W for both “α”-W (almost pure α phase) and “β”-W (mixed phase) in Fig. 6, we can only assign an upper bound for λSD, similarly short in the two phases. 11VI.
CONCLUSIONS In summary, we report measurements of spin mixing conductances of Py/W ﬁlms with controlled amounts of α and β phase W, measured by Gilbert damping through ferromag- netic resonance (FMR).
We ﬁnd no strong diﬀerences in the spin mixing conductances of Py/α-W and Py/β-W, measured as g↑↓= 6.7–7.4 nm−2, although control of the β phase is seen to be more diﬃcult near the interface with Py.
Our experimental results also indicate that W, no matter of which phase, is a good spin sink, but with relatively small spin mixing conductance in Ni81Fe19 (Py)/W, similar to Ta in Py/Ta. VII.

NOTES 1Focused ion-beam (FIB) and FEI Helios NanoLab 660 were used to prepare foils for TEM studies.
To protect the heterostructures against the ion-beam damage during sample preparation, amorphous Platinum (1.5 µm thick) was sputtered on the surface of the wafers by electron and ion beam, respectively.
TEM and high-resolution cross-sectional TEM (HR-XTEM) analyses were performed by image Cs-corrected FEI Titan Themis 200 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Nano-beam electron diﬀraction pattern (DP) technique and Fourier transform (FT) analysis of the HRTEM have been utilized to identify the nature of each phase at the scale of 1–2 nm wide.
The nano-beam DPs were obtained by FEI Talos TEM operating at 200 kV. The second condenser aperture was set to 50 µm to obtain a small beam-convergence angle.
In the diﬀraction mode, the beam was condensed to a spot (∼1–2 nm) and a convergent electron beam diﬀraction (in this case, known as Kossel-M¨ollenstedt pattern) was acquired at diﬀerent locations on the sample.

1. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurements for Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(tW ) (blue) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(tW ) (red) deposited on glass substrates.
(a) tW = 30 nm; (b) tW = 10 nm.
Solid vertical lines show the calculated reﬂections and intensities for α-W and β-W peaks.
(c) Grazing- incidence XRD measurements for Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(10 nm) samples.
The inset shows the α(211) reﬂections observed in both samples.
The blue and the red dashed lines refer to the ﬁts for Py/“α”-W and Py/“β”-W, respectively.
The black dashed line refers to the identical quadratic background. 16FIG.
2. (a) High-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR-XTEM) image of SiO2/Ta(5 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(30 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Ta(5 nm) heterostructure.
The α-W grains are columnar with lateral radius of 10–20 nm, with larger grain size in the growth direction.
(b) Selected-area diﬀraction (SAD) pattern of the heterostructure, showing the preferred texture of α-W grains on Py layer, {111}Py//{011}α-W (see calculated pattern in the inset).
No sign of β-W was detected in this heterostructure. 17FIG.
3. (a) HR-XTEM image of SiO2/Ta(5 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(30 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Ta(5 nm), showing mixed-phase α-W and β-W. Convergent nanobeam electron diﬀraction (CBED) patterns, bottom, reveal the co-existence of separated α-W, β-W, and fcc Py.
(b) Close- up of one region near the Py/W interface in (a), with discrete spatial Fourier Transform (FT).
The FT is consistent with a single-crystal pattern of (1¯11)[110]Py//(011)[1¯11]α-W//(002)[200]β-W, as shown in the calculated pattern (bottom right).
(c) FT of interface region (dotted box), showing co-existence of α-W and β-W in the ﬁrst 5 nm W adjacent to the Py/W interface. 18FIG. 4.
The total conductance Gtotal = 1/Rtotal as a function of W thickness.
Blue dots refer to Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(tW ) samples and red dots refer to Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(tW ) samples.
The solid lines are linear ﬁts. 19FIG. 5.
Half-power FMR linewidth ∆H1/2 spectra of reference sample Py(5 nm) (black), Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(10 nm) (blue) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(10 nm) (red) samples.
The solid lines are linear ﬁts. 20FIG. 6.
Gilbert damping α of the reference sample Py(5 nm) (black), Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(tW ) (blue) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(tW ) (red) samples.
The blue and red dash lines refer to averaged enhanced damping for Py(5 nm)/“α”-W(tW ) and Py(5 nm)/“β”-W(tW ), respectively. 21FIG.
7. Damping enhancement ∆α = αPy/W −αPy of Py(tPy)/“α”-W(10 nm) (blue), Py(tPy)/“β”- W(10 nm) (red) and “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) (green) samples, normalized to the Gilbert damping of reference samples αPy with the same Py thickness.
Solid lines refer to ﬁtting with Equation 2.
Inset: Gilbert damping α of the reference sample Py(tPy) (black), Py(tPy)/“α”-W(10 nm) (blue), Py(tPy)/“β”-W(10 nm) (red) and “α”-W(10 nm)/Py(5 nm) (green) samples. 22
