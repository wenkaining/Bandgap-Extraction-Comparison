⋆e-mail: andres.santander@csnsm.in2p3.fr 1Similar to silicon that is the basis of conventional electronics, strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is the bedrock of the emerging ﬁeld of oxide electronics [1, 2].
SrTiO3 is the preferred template to create exotic two-dimensional (2D) phases of electron matter at oxide interfaces [3–5], exhibiting metal-insulator transi- tions [6, 7], superconductivity [8, 9], or large negative magnetoresistance [10].
However, the physical nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs) remains elusive, although its determination is crucial to understand their remarkable properties [11, 12].
Here we show, using angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3, independent of bulk carrier densities over more than seven decades, including the undoped insulating material.
This 2DEG is conﬁned within a region of ∼5 unit cells with a sheet carrier density of ∼0.35 electrons per a2 (a is the cubic lattice parameter).
We unveil a remarkable electronic structure consisting on multiple subbands of heavy and light electrons.
The similarity of this 2DEG with those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures [6, 8, 13] and ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors [9, 14] suggests that diﬀerent forms of electron conﬁnement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same 2DEG.
Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices, and a novel route to generate 2DEGs at surfaces of transition-metal oxides.
In the cubic phase, stoichiometric SrTiO3 has an empty t2g conduction manifold composed of three dispersive three-dimensional (3D) bands that are degenerate at the Γ point [15].
As schematically shown in ﬁgure 1(a), its band structure along one direction, say ky, consists of a weakly dispersive (heavy mass) band and a pair of degenerate strongly dispersive (light mass) bands.
They arise, respectively, from the small and large overlaps along y of neighbouring Ti 3dxz, 3dxy and 3dyz orbitals, as depicted in ﬁgure 1(b) for the 3dxy orbitals.
Thus, the dxy-like band will be light in the xy plane and heavy along z, while the dyz band will be heavy along x and light in the yz plane, and the dxz band will be heavy along y and light in the xz plane.
The resulting three Fermi surface sheets, projected on the xy plane of the sample surface, are shown in ﬁgure 1(c) for several bulk dopings.
ARPES is a powerful technique to probe the electronic structure of materials [16].
Previ- 2ous ARPES experiments addressed the bulk electronic structure of doped SrTiO3, revealing dispersing quasiparticle peaks, in-gap features, and discussing possible polaronic eﬀects near the Fermi energy (EF) [17–22].
As we shall see, our ARPES data do not conform to the expected lightly-doped bulk band picture, but reveal that a novel 2DEG with a complex subband structure, schematized in Figs. 1(d,e), is realized at the low-temperature vacuum- cleaved surface of this material.
Crucial to our discoveries is the comparison of samples with very diﬀerent bulk carrier densities of n3D ≲1013 cm−3 (essentially non-doped), n3D ∼1018 cm−3 (low-doped) and n3D ∼1020 cm−3 (highly-doped), determined by bulk-sensitive techniques (see Methods).
Their large doping diﬀerence is already revealed by their photographs, shown in Figs. 2(a-c): while the non-doped sample is transparent, the highly-doped sample is shiny black.
Our ﬁrst striking observation, shown in ﬁgure 2(d), is that even for the transparent non-doped sample [Fig. 2(a)], for which no bulk bands at EF are expected, the cleaved surface yields intense strongly dispersive bands across the Fermi level.
They correspond to a large density of mobile carriers (see later) ensuring that, despite the electron emission, there is no charging of the surface of this otherwise highly insulating sample in the bulk.
Equally stunning is the fact, shown in ﬁgures 2(d-f), that for all the studied bulk dopings the electronic states around EF, and in particular the bandwidths (W = EF−band bottom) and Fermi momenta (kF) of the observed bands, are essentially identical.
All these observations contrast sharply with the large diﬀerences that would be expected from electron-doping in the bulk [Fig. 1(c)], where the 3D density of carriers scales as k3 F.
The immediate conclusion is that the observed bands correspond to 2D states (see also the Supplementary Material).
The spectra in ﬁgures 2(d-f), taken around Γ102 and Γ012 [B-like points in Fig. 2(j)], clearly show two strongly dispersing bands, termed ‘upper and lower parabolic bands’.
Through a closer examination, we identify other two weakly dispersing bands, termed ‘upper and lower shallow bands’.
Their presence is revealed either by rotating the light polarization at right angles with respect to the measurement direction, as illustrated for the non-doped sample in ﬁgure 2(g), or by measuring around a Γ-point at a larger emission angle in a diﬀerent Brillouin zone [Γ112, or point C in Fig. 2(j)], as shown for the low-doped sample in ﬁgures 2(h-i).
Note furthermore, from ﬁgures 2(d, g) that the changes in light polarization aﬀect diﬀerently the two strongly dispersing parabolic bands –completely suppressing the upper parabolic band in the case of ﬁgure 2(g), while the increase in emission angle [compare 3Fig. 2(e) to Figs. 2(h, i)] enhances in the same asymmetric way the negative-k intensities of the two shallow bands and weakens the parabolic bands.
These dichroic eﬀects, due to dipole-transition selection rules [16, 18], unambiguously show that the two parabolic bands have diﬀerent symmetries, which are also diﬀerent from a third symmetry common to the two shallow subbands (see also the Supplementary Material).
Figure 3 illustrates the complete set of four bands overlaid on the data.
Let us now analyze quantitatively this band structure.
The upper and lower parabolic bands [Figs. 2(d-f)] have bandwidths of 210 meV and 100 meV, and Fermi momenta of 0.21 ˚A−1 and 0.13 ˚A −1, respectively.
Thus, they correspond to light carriers with eﬀective masses m⋆ y ≈0.7me along ky (me is the free electron mass).
The upper shallow band [Figs. 2(g, h)] has a bandwidth of 40 meV and a Fermi momentum kF ≈0.3 −0.4 ˚A−1, corresponding to heavy carriers with m⋆ y ≈10 −20me.
The lower shallow band [Fig. 2(j)] disperses from about −160 meV at Γ to about −120 meV at the Brillouin-zone boundary, and is thus fully occupied.
All the above ﬁgures diﬀer by less than 10% between the lowest- and highest-doping samples.
As shown in ﬁgure 4, the lower parabolic band generates a circular Fermi surface of radius 0.21 ˚A−1 while the upper parabolic band and the upper shallow band form ellipsoids along kx and ky, respectively, of semi axes 0.13 ˚A −1 and 0.3 −0.4 ˚A−1, yielding a 2D 4-pronged Fermi surface.
From the area enclosed by each Fermi surface (AF), the corresponding 2D carrier density is n2D = AF/(2π2).
This gives 7 ×1013 cm−2, or about 0.11 electrons per a2, for the circular Fermi surface, and ∼6.2 −8.3 × 1013 cm−2, or about 0.1 −0.13 electrons per a2, for each of the elliptical Fermi surfaces.
We then obtain ∼0.31 −0.36 electrons per a2 (or about 2 × 1014 cm−2) coming from all the observed bands that cross EF.
We now rationalize the observed electronic states as the subbands of a 2DEG conﬁned within a few unit cells at the surface of SrTiO3.
To this end, we consider a potential V0 at the surface that conﬁnes the electronic motion along z [inset of Fig. 1(d)].
This lowers the energy of the bands by about V0, similar to the ‘band-bending’ at semiconductor heterostructures, and produces an energy splitting between the diﬀerent eigenstates that is inversely proportional to their eﬀective masses along z (m⋆ z).
The resulting subband structure, depicted in Fig. 1(d), consists on a single dxy-like band and two dxz/dyz bands that are degenerate at Γ. As the dxy band has a very large m⋆ z, the attractive conﬁning potential will merely pull it beneath EF (its energy-splitted eigenstates will have a negligible 4separation).
Thus, we identify this band with the lower parabolic band in our spectra of ﬁgure 2, and note it E1(dxy).
On the other hand, the dxz and dyz subbands, light along z, will show large energy splittings.
They are noted En(dxz/yz) (n = 1, 2, . . . ) in ﬁgure 1(d).
Other eﬀects beyond this simpliﬁed analysis, such as spin-orbit coupling and/or the low- temperature tetragonal [23, 24] and possibly orthorhombic [23] distortions, can lift the de- generacy between the dxz and dyz subbands, as represented in Fig.1 (e).
This would induce a coupling, resulting in hybridization between the light and heavy subbands, as indeed evidenced by our data for the lower parabolic band and the shallow bands (Fig. 3, LV polarization).
Another possibility would be a surface reconstruction, although this is not evidenced by our data –which follows the periodicity of the unreconstructed bulk lattice without apparent band folding.
Resolving the detailed origin of such degeneracy lift, which is not relevant to the discoveries reported here, will require future investigations.
Hence, we identify the lower shallow band and upper parabolic band in our spectra (Fig. 2) with the splitted doublet E1(dxz) and E1(dyz), respectively.
From the data, the doublet splitting is ∆≈60 meV.
We ﬁnally identify the upper shallow band with E2(dxz).
Given that the bot- tom of this band is at −40 meV, its upper partner E2(dyz) would occur at about +20 meV, and cannot be observed.
This subband hierarchy respects the symmetry considerations previously deduced from the eﬀects of light polarization and emission angle, rendering additional support to the picture of a conﬁned 2DEG.
To characterize quantitatively this 2DEG, we use a simple schematic model.
We assume that the surface has a homogeneous positive charge density, generating a conﬁning electric ﬁeld F inside the solid, and thus a triangular wedge potential of depth V0 at the surface (z = 0) and value V (z) = −V0+eFz along z, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 1(d).
The details of the calculations are presented in the Supplementary Information.
From the experimental splitting E2(dxz) −E1(dxz) = 120 meV between the ﬁrst two subbands of the dxz orbitals, and their light mass m⋆ z ≈0.7me along z, we deduce a strong conﬁning ﬁeld F ≈83 MV/m. From E1(dxy), the conﬁning potential is estimated to be V0 ≈−260 meV.
The deduced values of V0 and F, and the measured eﬀective masses and doublet splitting of 60 meV between the dxz and dyz subbands, suﬃce to retrieve all the observed subband energies.
The width L of the conﬁned 2DEG results from the spatial extension of the highest occupied state E2(dxz), or independently from the approximate expression eFL ≈E2(dxz) −E1(dxz) 5[inset of Fig. 1(d)], yielding consistent values in the range L ≈14.5−18 ˚A ≈4−5 unit cells.
Additionally, from the conﬁning ﬁeld F and the polarizability of the medium, we calculate an induced surface charge density of ∼0.25 electrons per a2, in good agreement with the experimental value.
The band-bending due to conﬁnement should induce an energy down-shift of about V0 of the O-2p valence band, creating a gap with respect to EF that is larger than the optical gap.
This eﬀect has been reported in previous experiments [18, 20], and is also observed in our data (Supplementary Material).
Aiura and coworkers [18] demonstrated that it is due to surface oxygen-vacancies, which appear thus as the most reasonable candidate to explain the origin of the 2DEG observed in our experiments.
In fact, cleaving is likely to produce a massive removal of surface oxygen, much larger than and basically independent of the bulk concentration of vacancies, providing 2 dopant electrons per created vacancy.
These two electrons will delocalize within the potential wedge created by the positively charged layer of surface vacancies.
Note that cleaving this almost cubic oxide system necessitates overcoming the strong binding electric forces between atoms, equivalent to inducing a ‘me- chanical dielectric breakdown’.
Interestingly, from our data analysis, the large electric ﬁeld generated at the surface of SrTiO3 is of the order of typical dielectric breakdown ﬁelds [25], and thus compatible with a cleaved surface in this material.
To give additional support to our picture and data analyses, we performed ab-initio calculations including oxygen vacancies at the surface.
The results are consistent with the above simpliﬁed wedge-potential model (Supplementary Material).
Strikingly, the sheet carrier density, the conﬁnement size, the conﬁning ﬁeld F and po- tential V0, and the presence of both mobile and quasi-localized carriers in this novel electron gas at the surface of SrTiO3 compare well with the characteristics of other 2DEG’s at dif- ferent types of SrTiO3 interfaces [6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 26–28].
All these remarkable consistencies suggest that all these 2DEG’s may be understood on a common basis.
In particular, note that diﬀerent electron conﬁnement mechanisms, such as the electric ﬁeld created by a polar LaAlO3 layer [6] or the direct application of an electric ﬁeld [9], would recreate a 2DEG conﬁned within a nanometric layer of SrTiO3 with a subband electronic structure similar in nature to the one directly unveiled by our measurements.
Our experiments directly show that the Ti-3dxy states of light and highly mobile carriers become the ﬁrst available levels for the 2DEG at the surface of SrTiO3.
Altogether, our 6results demonstrate the fundamental paradigm for understanding the properties of oxide surfaces and heterostructures, namely the ‘electronic reconstruction’ into several partially- occupied subbands at the near-interface region [9, 11, 12, 29, 30].
Our discoveries also raise the appealing possibility that oxygen vacancies may be induced to aggregate or self-organize at the surface of SrTiO3 or related interfaces -a situation that might be at the origin of the reversible patterning of conducting nano-lines in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces [2, 7].
In a similar way, nano-patterning of oxygen vacancies at the surface of SrTiO3 could provide a model system for low dimensional conﬁned electron gases.
More generally, we suggest that the engineering of atom-vacancies at the surfaces of transition metal oxides will open a new avenue in correlated-electron surface science.
METHODS Sample preparation and measurement technique High-quality single crystals of SrTiO3 were doped with oxygen vacancies by high- temperature treatment in low-oxygen pressure, except for the non-doped sample, which was a bare SrTiO3 substrate measured without any previous preparation.
The bulk carrier concentrations were deduce from Hall and resistivity measurements.
The ARPES experiments were done at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC, Univer- sity of Wisconsin, Madison) and at the Synchrotron SOLEIL (France), using 47 eV (SRC) and 45 eV (SOLEIL) linearly polarized photons, a Scienta 2002 detector with horizontal slits for the highly-doped sample (SRC), and a Scienta R4000 with vertical slits for the low-doped (SRC) and non-doped (SOLEIL) samples.
The above photon energies, close to resonant pho- toemission at the Ti 3p →3d edge, yield intense quasi-particle peaks in SrTiO3 [18].
The momentum and energy resolutions were 0.25◦and 20 meV, respectively.
The diameter of the incident photon beam was smaller than 100 µm.
The samples were cleaved in-situ along the c-axis at 20 K (SRC) and 10 K (Soleil), in pressure lower than 6 × 10−11 Torr.
For each set of measurements, one narrow highly-emitting terrace was kept ﬁxed.
The results have been reproduced in at least two cleaves for each bulk doping.
7Measurement geometries The sample’s surface deﬁnes the xy-plane.
The measurements on the k-space hemisphere were taken along (010) (or ky).
The data in Figs. 2(d, g) and Fig. 3 were collected in B- like points slightly above Γ102, with the photon polarization along y (LV) in Fig. 2(d), and along the xz-plane (LH) in Fig. 2(h).
The data in Figs. 2(e, f) [Figs. 2(h, i)] correspond to B-like (C-like) points slightly above Γ012 (slightly below Γ112).
For these points, the photon polarization is not parallel to any of the sample’s symmetry directions or planes, and the spectra have diﬀerent symmetry mixtures.
The data in Fig. 4 were collected with LH photon polarization.
The Supplementary Information discusses further the measurement geometries and their corresponding dipole selection rules.

⋆e-mail: andres.santander@csnsm.in2p3.fr 1Abstract The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data on SrTiO3 show the existence of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) beneath the surface of this material.
We provide here additional evidence of its 2D-like nature, showing that the bands do not disperse along the kz [or (001)] direction, although their intensity is strongly modulated as a function of photon energy, photon polarization and emission angle for diﬀerent Brillouin zones.
We also provide the details of the modeling of these bands in terms of a conﬁning wedge-like potential well.
Additionally, we show that in our data the O-2p valence band is shifted to larger binding energies with respect to what is expected from the bulk band gap (‘band bending’), by an amount comparable to the conﬁning potential depth.
We ﬁnally present ab-initio calculations that support the picture of the formation of a 2DEG due to oxygen vacancies at the surface of SrTiO3.
2Photon energy dependence of the electronic subbands at the surface of SrTiO3 Figure SF 1 presents data obtained at normal emission as a function of photon energy.
The data were collected using linear horizontal (LH) light polarization (polarization vector in the xz plane), and detection along x [horizontal (H) slits] in the sample’s xz-plane, which in this geometry also coincides with the light incidence plane.
The ﬁnal electron state has to be even with respect to the sample’s mirror plane to be detected by the analyzer (the xz- plane in this case) –otherwise the electron wavefunction would be zero in this plane.
Hence, the dipole-transition selection rules imply that the initial state and the dipole operator (equivalently, the polarization vector) must have the same symmetry with respect to the mirror plane [SR3, SR4].
In the geometry of ﬁgure SF 1, the light polarization is even under reﬂection on the xz plane.
Thus, only initial states of even parity with respect to this plane can be detected.
Hence, only the upper dxz-like band, which is furthermore light along x, is observed in this geometry (experimentally, the lower dxz-like band has a very weak intensity in this geometry).
As observed in Fig. SF 1(c, d), the upper dxz-like band does not disperse as a function of photon energy, or equivalently as a function of kz, conﬁrming its 2D surface-like charac- ter.
However, it presents a marked intensity modulation as a function of photon energy, a behaviour also observed in surface states and quantum well states of simple metallic sys- tems [SR1, SR2].
Thus, for instance, while the band is clearly seen at hν = 30 eV, its intensity is very weak around hν = 47 eV, where the rest of our experiments were per- formed.
As explained in the main text, and also discussed below, at this photon energy the dxz-like bands and the other subbands are distinctly observed in other Brillouin zones and other polarization/slits geometries.
Intensity modulations of the electronic subbands with emission angle and photon polarization Fig. SF 2 shows the energy-momentum intensity maps for cuts at three points in reciprocal space labeled as A, B and C.
The spectra at points B and C were already discussed in the main text, and are again shown here for clarity and completeness in the discussion.

a, Schematics of the experimental geometry for the data in this ﬁgure.
The sample is the dark parallelepiped, the xz mirror plane is transparent, the light beam is represented by the blue arrow, its polarization by the red double arrow, and the collected electron beam by the dashed orange arrows.
The same conventions are used in the rest of the ﬁgures in this Supplement.
b, Representation of the 3D reciprocal space.
The region covered by varying the photon energy from 25 eV to 100 eV is shown red dashed arrow and the thick red lines.
The open circles are Γ points, the dashed lines are Brillouin-zone edges, and the violet circle is the spherical shell on which the measurements at hν = 47 eV are carried out.
To convert the photon energy dependence into kz dependence, an ‘inner potential’ of 12 eV was used, as deduced in previous works [SR4].
c, Integrated photoemission spectra at normal emission over a wide energy range, showing the oxygen-vacancy related intra-gap states at 1.3 eV [SR4] and the quasi-particle (QP) peak near EF .
Notice the large variations of the QP peak intensity as a function of photon energy (varying from 25 eV to 100 eV in steps of 5 eV).
d, Zoom over the QP peak in c, after normalizing by the area of the peak.
The peak does not disperse with photon energy (26 −100 eV in steps of 2 eV), indicating its 2D character.
e, Examples of two energy-momentum intensity maps at hν = 30 eV, at Γ002, and hν = 46 eV, close to the zone edge.
The band corresponds to the dxz states.
Its intensity is almost suppressed at hν = 46 eV, but the dispersion is unchanged.

All the spectra in this ﬁgure were measured at hν = 47 eV with LH light polarization and detection along y [vertical (V) slits], as schematically shown in Fig. SF 2(b).
At normal emission (point A), the detection plane coincides with the sample’s yz-plane.
Exactly at Γ, as explained in the previous section, the only symmetry-allowed states are dxz-like, which have however a very weak intensity at this photon energy.
Note that in this case the polarization vector has components both along the x and z directions, the ﬁrst being odd with respect to the detection plane, and the second even with respect the same plane.
Thus, away from Γ, at emission along the yz-plane, both dxy-like bands (odd with respect the yz-plane) and dyz-like bands (even with respect the same plane) can be observed.
On the other hand, for points B-like and C-like, the photon polarization is not parallel to any of the sample’s symmetry directions or planes, and the spectra have diﬀerent symmetry mixtures depending on the measurement point in k-space (see also further).
From ﬁgure SF 2(c), we see then that at normal emission (point A) the two strongly dispersing parabolic bands are distinctly observed.
These bands remain unchanged at points B and C [Figs SF 2(d,e)], though their spectral intensity decreases as the emission angle increases.
Note, in particular, that although points B and C are equidistant from Γ, the light parabolic bands are more intense at point B, where the emission angle is lower.
Conversely, the two weakly dispersing bands (the ‘upper and lower shallow bands’) are best seen at point C, where the emission angle is largest.
Figures SF 2(f, g) show the energy distribution curves (EDCs) at point C integrated over intervals of 0.1 ˚A−1.
The lower shallow band is clearly seen in the raw data dispersing from Γ (blue EDC) to the zone edge (green EDC).
Additionally, as noted in the main paper, the same asymmetric enhancement of the negative- k intensities for the two shallow bands is observed in point C.
This indicates that the two shallow bands have the same symmetry.
These shallow bands rapidly loose intensity as the emission angle decreases, to completely disappear in the spectra at normal emission, further indicating that their symmetry (or more generally, their spectral function) is not the same of either of the parabolic bands.
From the data of Fig. SF 2, it is then apparent that there is a unique underlying band structure at all three points A, B and C, further proving the 2D-like character of all the 5-0.4 0.0 0.4 ky (Å-1) -0.4 0.0 0.4 ky (Å-1) min max -0.4 0.0 0.4 ky (Å-1) -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 E-EF (eV) Intensity (arb. units) -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 E-EF (eV) -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 E-EF (eV) f g c e d 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 kz (Å -1) -2 0 2 k// (Å -1) A B C (100) (110) a A B C x y z A x y z B b y x z C Polar = LH Slits = V Figure SF 2: Intensity modulations of the electronic subbands as a function of emission angle.

The blue EDC is located at Γ, and the green EDC is at the zone edge observed bands.
As described in the main text, the photoemission intensity from the diﬀerent subbands is also strongly modulated by the photon polarization.
For the sake of completeness in the discussion, we show again in Fig. SF 3 the energy-momentum intensity maps and EDCs taken at Γ102 (point B) for the non-doped sample.
These data were collected at hν = 45 eV with V- slits (detection along y) using both LV and LH polarized photons, as shown in Figs. SF 3(a, 6b).
In this geometry, where electrons are detected oﬀ-normal emission, only the xz-plane (coinciding with the light-incidence plane), where Γ102 lies, is a high-symmetry plane.
For LV polarization, the light electric ﬁeld is odd with respect to this mirror plane.
Thus, only the dxy- and dyz-like bands, which are both odd with respect to the xz-plane, can be detected, as indeed observed [Figs. SF 3(c, d)].
On the other hand, for LH polarized light, the electric ﬁeld is even with respect to the mirror plane, and only dxz-like bands can be detected at Γ102, also in agreement with the observation of the upper shallow band [Figs. SF 3(e, f)].
Away from Γ102 along the detection direction there is symmetry mixing.
Experimentally, the lower parabolic band, but not the upper parabolic band, is again observed.
Band bending of the O-2p valence band Figure SF 4(a) shows the angle-resolved data over a wide energy range at normal emission, LH polarization, V-slits and hν = 47 eV [point A in ﬁgure SF 3(a)] for the sample that has bulk doping n3D = 1018 cm−3.
The dispersion of the oxygen valence band, roughly located in between -9 eV and -4 eV, is clearly observed, attesting the high-quality of the surfaces obtained after cleaving.
As seen from ﬁgures SF 4(a, b), the peak position of the valence-band maximum (VBM) is located at E ≈−4.35 eV, and the leading-edge of the valence band is located at about −3.9 eV. These values are systematically lower by 200-500 meV than the peak position of the bulk VBM, predicted to be about −3.9 eV by tight-binding calculations [SR6], and the bulk optical band gap of 3.75 eV [SR7], shown for comparison.
These results are consistent with the dispersions and shifts reported in previous works [SR4, SR6].
More important, the observed energy down-shift of the oxygen valence band is in quantitative agreement with the conﬁning potential at the surface, estimated to be V0 ≈−300 meV (see below and main paper), and responsible for the formation of the two-dimensional electron gas and the subbands beneath the surface of cleaved SrTiO3.
This indicates that such a band shift of the O-2p valence band is due to band-bending by the above conﬁning potential.
Furthermore, as noted in Ref.
[SR4], when the cleaved surface is exposed to oxygen, the O-2p valence band shifts back by about 200 meV towards EF, lending support to the hypothesis that the conﬁning potential, in the case of cleaved SrTiO3, is due to surface oxygen vacancies.

Wedge model We approximate the eﬀect of the conﬁning potential acting in the z-direction by a poten- tial wedge V (z) = V0+eFz, where e is the charge of the electron and F is the strength of the electric ﬁeld along z.
The quantized eigenenergies En are given in very good approximation by [SR8, SR9]: En = V0 +  ℏ2 2m⋆z 1/3 3π 2   n −1 4  eF 2/3 , (1) where n = 1,2,3,. .
., and m⋆ z is the eﬀective mass in the z-direction.
The exact eigenenergies have n −1 4 in this equation replaced by 0.7587, 1.7540, and 2.7575, respectively, for the three lowest solutions [SR9].
The average value of z for the n-th subband is eF ⟨zn⟩= 92 3|En −V0| [SR9].
Replacing with the appropriate physical constants, one gets En = V0 + 9 × 10−7 me m⋆z 1/3  n −1 4 2/3 F 2/3, (2) where me is the free electron mass, En and V0 are expressed in eV, and F is expressed in V/m. This expression allows to determine the ﬁeld strength F from the experimental subband splitting ∆E = E2 −E1 between the ﬁrst to subbands of dxz/yz character.
Notice that, in cubic symmetry, the dxz- and dyz-like bands have the same small eﬀective mass in the z-direction, with m⋆ z ≈0.7me from our experiments.
From the experimental value ∆E ≈120 meV, we get F ≈83 MV/m. Given the wedge-like form of the potential, the states with higher energy will have the largest extension along z.
In our case, the observed highest occupied state is the upper shallow subband, which would correspond to the n = 2 state of the dxz-like band.
Thus, with the above ﬁeld strength, we can estimate the depth (L) of the conﬁning potential from the approximation eFL ≈[E2(dxz) −E1(dxz] (note that V0 is not needed to compute this).
This gives L ≈14.5 ˚A, or about 3.7 unit cells.
The potential at the bottom of the wedge well (V0) can, in turn, be estimated from the ﬁeld strength and the bottom of the dxy parabolic band [E1(dxy) ≈−210 meV], which has a heavy mass along z of m⋆ z ≈20me.
This yields V0 ≈−260 meV.
This value allows an independent estimate of the width of the well from the average value of z for the n = 2 subband, namely eF ⟨z2⟩= 2 3|E2 −V0|.
Using E2(dxz) = −40 meV, we obtain ⟨z2⟩= 17.7 ˚A, or about 4.5 unit cells.
Additionally, as the potential V (z) remains negative (i.e., conﬁning) while eFz ≲V0, this yields Lmax ≈31 ˚A ≈8 unit cells as a maximum bound for the width of the 2DEG.
These independent estimates provide important crosschecks for the internal consistency of our analysis.
The energy of the bottom of the diﬀerent dyz/xz subbands is then readily calculated from their light eﬀective masses along z and the values of V0 and F. One obtains: E1(dyz/xz) = −100 meV, and E2(dyz/xz) = +20 meV.
This agrees with the observations: only the ﬁrst dyz subband (the small light parabola in the xy-plane) lies below EF.
The experimentally observed degeneracy lift between the dxz and dyz bands is not taken into account by this simple model.
From the data, we know that the E1(dxz) subband (the lower shallow subband) is shifted by about 60 meV below its dyz partner.
One then expects that the upper shallow 10subband lies at an energy E2(dxz) = E2(dxz/yz) −60meV = −40 meV, again in excellent agreement with the observations.
Finally, we can also use our estimate of F to compute the superﬁcial charge density σ2D induced by the conﬁning potential.
We follow the same type of calculation used by Ueno and coworkers (Ref.
[SR8], Supplementary Material), namely: e 2σ2D = Z F 0 ǫ0ǫ(F ′)dF ′, (3) where ǫ0 is the vacuum dielectric constant and ǫ(F) is the material’s dielectric permittivity.
Empirically, it is well established that the dielectric permittivity of SrTiO3 depends on the electric ﬁeld strength F according to the relation [SR10]: ǫ(F) ≈1/(4 ×10−5 + 5 ×10−10F), where F is in V/m. We then readily obtain σ ≈0.25 e/a2, where a = 3.905 ˚A is the cubic lattice parameter.
This value is consistent with the experimental electron count ∼ 0.31 −0.36 e/a2, obtained from the area of the Fermi surfaces (see main text).
LDA slab calculations of the electronic structure in the presence of surface oxygen vacancies To illustrate the eﬀects on the band structure of SrTiO3 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies near the surface, we performed ab initio density functional calculations within the local density approximation.
We adopted the Wien2k code and modelled the surface by considering slabs of 1 × 1 × 12 cells.
We considered both SrO and TiO2 terminations, and put one oxygen vacancy defect at the surface.
Our goal here is to understand, through a realistic yet computationally simple calculation, whether the presence of such vacancies can yield a 2DEG at the surface with the concomitant energy lowering for the slab states.
Thus, in this simple initial study, we considered the undistorted cubic cell and did not relax the lattice.
Our results are presented in Fig. SF 5.
They show that the main features of the 2DEG at the surface of vacuum-cleaved SrTiO3, discussed in the main text, are borne out by this calculation.
Namely, that the bottom of the t2g manifold around the Γ-point is lowered in energy by the eﬀective attractive potential by as much as 200 meV.
Moreover, the results also correctly capture the fact that the dxy parabolic band, due to its large eﬀective mass along the z-direction, is pulled down more that the dxz/yz doublet.
While it is appealing that these generic features are well captured by the LDA results, 11one should bear in mind that due to the technical limitations in the cell size that can be considered, our calculations remain on the qualitative level.
A larger computational eﬀort, including clusters of surface vacancies, is in progress.
