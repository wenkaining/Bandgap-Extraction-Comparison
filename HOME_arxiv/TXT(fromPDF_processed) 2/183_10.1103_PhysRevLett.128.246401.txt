Anomalous contribution to the nematic electronic states from the structural transition in FeSe revealed by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy Yuanyuan Yang,1 Qisi Wang,2 Shaofeng Duan,1 Hongliang Wo,2 Chaozhi Huang,1 Shichong Wang,1 Lingxiao Gu,1 Dao Xiang,3, 4 Dong Qian,1, 4, 5 Jun Zhao,2, 6 and Wentao Zhang1, 4, 5, ∗ 1Key Laboratory of Artiﬁcial Structures and Quantum Control (Ministry of Education), Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China 2State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics and Department of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China 3Key Laboratory for Laser Plasmas (Ministry of Education), School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China 4Tsung-Dao Lee Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China 5Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China 6Institute of Nanoelectronics and Quantum Computing, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China (Dated: June 15, 2022) High-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements were made on FeSe superconductors.
With ultrafast photoexcitation, two critical excitation ﬂuences that correspond to two ultrafast electronic phase transitions were found only in the dyz-orbit-derived band near the Brillouin-zone center within our time and energy resolution.
Upon comparison to the detailed temperature dependent measurements, we conclude that there are two equilibrium electronic phase transitions (at approximately 90 and 120 K) above the superconduct- ing transition temperature, and an anomalous contribution on the scale of 10 meV to the nematic states from the structural transition is experimentally determined.
Our observations strongly suggest that the electronic phase transition at 120 K must be taken into account in the energy band development of FeSe, and, further- more, the contribution of the structural transition plays an important role in the nematic phase of iron-based high-temperature superconductors.
Nematic order in iron-based superconductors refers to an electronic phase with broken rotational symmetry but pre- served translational symmetry, and usually occurs at decreas- ing temperature combined with a lattice structure transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase.
Such a nematic phase may play a pivotal role in high-temperature superconducting pairing, and its underlying physics is a predominant topic in the study of iron-based systems [1–6].
The electronic nematic phase can be a result of the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic struc- tural phase transition, orbital correlation, or the set-in of mag- netic order, and early theoretical and experimental work sug- gested that the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic lattice distortion may be too small to drive the nematic electronic properties, such as in-plane resistivity [7–12].
However, there is still a lack of evidence of a purely electronic (nematic) phase transi- tion, and how much the structural transition contributes to the band renormalization is still not clear experimentally.
FeSe, with a superconducting transition at approximately 9 K, undergoes a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic lattice deforma- tion and a breaking of rotational symmetry of electronic or- der (nematic phase) at the same temperature of approximately 90 K without the long-range magnetic order as discovered in many other iron-based materials, allowing us to study the pure nematic phase over a wide temperature range [3, 13– 18].
However, the extent of the individual contributions of the structural transition and the purely electrical order to the nematic electronic states is still unknown.
As most charac- teristics of nematic order are measured at thermal equilibrium conditions [19–26], it is difﬁcult to differentiate the nematic electronic order from that of the structural transition and deter- mine the contribution to the nematic states from the structural transition.
Taking advantage of ultrafast experiments by us- ing strong ultrafast photon pulses to excite only the electronic states, retaining the preserved orthorhombic lattice structure, it is possible to drive only the electronic phase transitions in an ultrafast manner without deforming the crystal lattice [27, 28].
Thus, it is possible to isolate the electronic states from the lat- tice, and to clarify the origin of both the nematic and structural phase transitions and estimate the contribution of the struc- tural transition to the nematicity.
In this Letter, we report two ultrafast purely electronic phase transitions and two equilibrium phase transitions above the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe revealed by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES).
In particular, with improved energy and pump ﬂu- ence resolution [29], we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure at several hundred femtoseconds after ul- trafast photoexcitation exhibits a three-excitation-regime be- havior with two critical excitation ﬂuences of Fc1 ≈0.06 and Fc2 ≈0.2 mJ/cm2 only in the dyz-orbit-derived band within resolution, consistent with two equilibrium phase transitions found in the temperature dependent measurement.
It is quite anomalous that the dxz and dz2 bands shift downwards below Fc1 after ultrafast photoexcitation, while in contrast they shift upwards in the equilibrium temperature dependent measure- ment below the structural transition temperature.
By compar- ing the non-equilibrium and equilibrium measurements, we conclude that the nematic phase near the zone center of FeSe is closely related to the dyz orbit and the contribution to the nematicity from the structural transition cannot be negligible but comparable to that from the electronic transition.

with a photon energy hν = 1.77 eV and repetition rate of 500 kHz drive the sample into non-equilibrium states [30], and ultraviolet probe pulses (6.05 eV, s-polarized) subsequently photoemit electrons.
The energy and time resolution are 16.3 meV and 113 fs respectively, giving a time-bandwidth prod- uct of approximately 1840 meV·fs, close to the physical limit for Gaussion pulses.
The spot sizes of the pump and probe beam are about 100 and 12 µm, respectively, giving a pump ﬂuence resolution of about 2.5%[29].
Thermal drift of the sample position was automatically corrected by a computer with a precision less than 1 µm, ensuring the measurements were took on a ﬁxed spot with a precision of less than 1 µm.
FeSe single crystals were grown using KCl-ACl3 ﬂux under a permanent temperature gradient[31], and cleaved un- der ultrahigh-vacuum conditions with a pressure of 3×10−11 Torr.
All trARPES measurements were taken at an equilib- rium temperature of approximately 4.5 K. Equilibrium photoemission spectra probed by the 6.05-eV laser demonstrate three bands [32, 33], including one hole- like band (dxz) crossing the Fermi level, another band (dyz) with its top at approximately -20 meV, and one ﬂat band (dz2) located at -0.2 eV (Figs. 1(a) and (b)).
With a low pump ﬂu- ence of 0.025 mJ/cm2, photoemission spectra at 0.2 ps after photoexcitation show an up-shift of the dyz and a down-shift of the dxz band, which are more remarkable upon enhancing the pump ﬂuence up to 0.15 mJ/cm2.
At the highest pump ﬂuence of 0.4 mJ/cm2 that was measured, the dxz band shifts downwards further, but the dyz band shifts to higher binding energy, opposite to that at low pump ﬂuences.
The aforemen- tioned observation can be directly evidenced in the ﬂuence- dependent energy distribution curves (EDCs) at correspond- ing momentum (dyz in Fig. 1(c) and dxz in Fig. 1(d)).
Around a pump ﬂuence of approximately 0.06 mJ/cm2 (Fc1), there are apparent changes of the slope of the photoemission in- tensity as a function of pump ﬂuence for both the dxz and dyz bands (Fig. 1(e)).
Above a pump ﬂuence of approxi- mately 0.2 mJ/cm2 (Fc2), the photoemission intensity of the dyz band is almost unchanged upon enhancing the pump ﬂu- ence, but shows no resolvable change of the slope of the curve in the dxz band.
Both the Fc1 and Fc2 features are absent in the dz2 band.
We attribute the Fc1 feature to the critical pump ﬂuence that destroys the electronic nematic order and the Fc2 feature to another electronic phase transition as dis- cussed below.
The observed critical pump ﬂuences at Fc1 and Fc2 are also evidenced in the ultrafast energy-band shifts (Fig. 2).
The dxz band moves down gradually with increasing pump ﬂuence (Fig. 2(a)), with a shift of approximately 13 meV at a pump ﬂuence of 0.242 mJ/cm2 and delay time near 0.2 ps.
In con- trast, the dyz band up-shifts more greatly than the dxz band at low pump ﬂuence (Fig. 2(b)).
For the band dz2, the shift is only resolvable near time zero (Fig. 2(c)).
On the basis of band shifts as a function of delay time, the band shift os- cillates at a frequency of approximately 5.28 THz, which is the photoinduced A1g coherent phonon mode [33].
Detailed pump-ﬂuence dependencies of the band shifts show that both the dxz and dz2 bands shift almost linearly to the pump ﬂu- ence within our time and energy resolution (Figs. 2(d)–(f)), and only in the dyz band the pump-induced band shift increase signiﬁcantly below the critical pump ﬂuence Fc1 and drop above the critical pump ﬂuence Fc2 for delay times of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 ps.
The absence of the two critical ﬂuences at a delay time of 3 ps in band dyz suggests that the recovery time of the two phase transitions is shorter than 3 ps.
We note that even under strongly non-equilibrium situation the nematic or- der is destroyed, but with probe beam spot comparable to the3 30 20 10 0  ∆E (meV)  -40 -30 -20 -10 0  ∆E (meV)  0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Fluence (mJ/cm 2) -40 -30 -20 -10 0  ∆E (meV)  -30 -20 -10 0  ∆E (meV)  30 20 10 0  ∆E (meV) -30 -20 -10 0  ∆E (meV)  2 1 0 DelayTime (ps) (a) (b) (d) (e) (f) (c)  0.023  0.092  0.173  0.242 xz d yz d 2 z d 1 cF 2 cF  0.2 0.5 1 3  0.2 0.5 1 3  0.2 0.5 1 3 xz d yz d 2 z d FIG.

Fluence dependent measurements were taken at the ﬁxed delay time by ﬁnely tuning the pump pulse energy.
The momentum of the EDC in the analysis of the dxz band is at 0.25 ˚A−1, which is away from the Fermi momentum, to avoid the thermal broadening of the Fermi distribution.
size of the single orthorhombic domain, the dxz and dyz or- bits are still not equivalent, since the lattice is holding its low- temperature anisotropic structure.
The critical pump ﬂuence Fc2 can be also evidenced in the ultrafast evolution of the pump-induced non-equilibrium quasiparticles.
It is clear that at low energy the recovery rate is much smaller than that at high energy, presenting a kink at ap- proximately 0.06 eV (Fig. 3(a)), with the extracted quasipar- ticle recovery rate as a function of energy shown in Fig. 3(b).
Upon enhancing the pump ﬂuence, such a kink is becoming weaker and above approximately 0.2 mJ/cm2 (Fc2) the decay rate is even linear to the energy.
Such a critical pump ﬂuence at Fc2 is clearly evidenced by analysis of the slope of the de- cay rate as a function of energy in detail (Fig. 3(c)).
Such an energy scale at approximately 0.06 eV shown in the non-equilibrium quasiparticle recovery rate is an evidence of electrons scattered with some collective excitation, or a band gap at this energy.
However, in FeSe the cutoff energy of the phonon modes is approximately 40 meV [34] and there is no report of spin ﬂuctuation or other bosonic modes at approxi- mately 0.06 eV. Thus, such an energy scale of 0.06 eV pos- sibly results from electrons scattered with a band gap at this energy scale near the Fermi energy.

gap near the Brillouin zone center, but instead, equilibrium ARPES experiments at the M point in the FeSe family evi- denced a band gap between dxz and dyz of approximately 50 meV, which can be the orbital order parameter, below approx- imately 120 K [19, 22, 32, 35].
We speculate that the direct hopping of electrons between the gapped bands would excite electrons with energy below the energy gap, hindering the re- covery of the low-energy non-equilibrium quasiparticles, like the role played by bosonic modes at this energy [36, 37].
To reveal the underlying physics of the two ultrafast elec- tronic phase transitions, detailed equilibrium-temperature- dependent measurements were taken at the Brillouin-zone center (Fig. 4(a)).
The temperature-dependent band shift of dyz is similar to the ﬂuence-dependent band shift, as evi- denced by two temperature scales at approximately 90 K (Ts) and 120 K (TM).
The consistency of the shape of the curve of the dyz band shift between the temperature- and pump- ﬂuence-dependent measurements, and the similar energy scale between that from the non-equilibrium quasiparticle rate and the band gap at point M below 120 K strongly suggest that Fc2 is the critical ﬂuence quenching the M point dyz-dxz band gap (the orbital order) and that Fc1 is the ﬂuence draining the nematic states (Supplemental Discussion #2[38]).
It is con- sistent with the estimated non-equilibrium electronic temper- ature at 0.2 ps for the pump ﬂuence of Fc1 and Fc2, is approx- imately at Ts and TM, respectively (Supplemental FIG.

Comparison between equilibrium thermally and non-equilibrium optically pump-induced phase transitions.

The inset shows additional temperature dependent measurements of the dyz band on the other two samples with different photon energies and different momentum cuts.
For the 6 eV (p-polarized) probe, the cut is along X, and for the 7 eV probe, the cut is along Y (Supplemental Discussion #3[38]).
(b) Schematic showing the difference between equilibrium thermally induced and optically pump-induced band shifts. Discussion #1[38]).
Ts can be also clearly evidenced in the temperature- dependent band shifts of the dxz and dz2 orbits.
It is inter- esting that the bands dxz and dz2 shift to higher binding en- ergies below Ts, opposite to the case in which both of the bands shift to lower binding energies below the Fc1 in Fig. 2.
The absence of Ts in the ﬂuence dependent band shifts of the dxz and dz2 orbits suggests that ultrafast structural transition does not happen in the studied time and ﬂuence range, agree- ing with the fact that the timescale of the ultrafast photon- excitation-induced lattice distortion transition at similar pho- ton energy is much longer or needs a much higher pump ﬂu- ence in iron-based superconductors [44, 45].
The absence of structural transition indicates that the electronic states can be isolated from the lattice shortly after ultrafast photoexcita- tion, and the above-observed critical pump ﬂuences at Fc1 and Fc2 are purely electronic origin.
From above, it can be con- cluded that the structural transition at the Ts is driven by the nematicity.
Since the orbital transition temperature is higher, we can conclude that the nematicity, which is also a broken of rotational symmetry, is driven by the orbital order.
The difference between the optically pump-induced energy- band shift and temperature-dependent band shift near Γ is summarized in Fig. 4(b).
Ultrafast photoexcitation strongly modulates the energy band near the Fermi energy and drives the up-shift of the dyz bands and down-shift of the dxz and dz2 bands below the pump ﬂuence of Fc2.
Equilibrium thermal excitation induces similar energy-band shifts for the dyz orbit, while in contrast, the dxz and dz2 bands shift op- posite to that below Fc1.
All the bands near the Fermi energy shift down upon increasing the pump ﬂuence above Fc2 or heating the sample above TM synchronously.
Above Fc2 or TM, the band evolution is possibly a result of the chemical potential shift since there is a great enhancement of the den- sity of states near the Fermi energy due to the closure of the M-point band gap, consistent with a previous report [46].
The monotonic down-shifts of the dxz and dz2 bands may also be the results of the chemical potential shift after photoexcitation.
As schematized in Fig. 4(b), the different behavior be- tween the photoexcited energy-band shifts in Figs. 2(d)–(f) and temperature-induced band shifts in Fig. 4(a) suggests that some additional phase transition not sensitive to photoexcita- tion, such as the structural transition, must be counted to the electronic transition at Ts.
By subtracting the photoexcitation- driving band shifts (purely electronic order) from the thermal- driving ones (purely electronic order + additional phase tran- sition), the estimated net energy shifts for the dyz , dxz, and dz2 orbits from the additional transition in the temperature de- pendent measurement are approximately -1, 5, and 12 meV, respectively.
Such additional band shifts could be a result of different chemical potential shifts between the photoexcita- tion and equilibrium heating, but can be ruled out by the fact that the dyz band behaves similarly in the two experiments.
Any order that is also not sensitive to photoexcitation may explain our data, but no other long-range order has been ev- idenced in FeSe to date [47].
Magnetic ﬂuctuations at the same temperature scale of the structural transition were ob- served in FeSe [31], but it is also less possible, since mag- netic ﬂuctuations can be also destroyed by ultrafast photoex- citation [44].
The only additional order that is not sensitive to photoexcitation at such low pump ﬂuences and short de- lay times is the structural transition.
The observed additional band shifts in the dxz and dz2 bands are even larger than the purely electronic band shift of the dyz orbit, indicating that the structural transition plays an important role in the nematic electronic phase.
However, it is quite anomalous that for a lat- tice constant change of less than 0.5% in FeSe, the estimated structurally induced band shift from conventional theory is 1 order smaller [15, 17, 18, 33].
Our ﬁndings may suggest that there is possible strong lattice-nematicity coupling in the iron- based superconductor.
Further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanism of the anomalous contribution to the electronic order from the structural transition.
In summary, high-resolution trARPES measurements were conducted on FeSe superconductors, and two critical pump ﬂuences were found that correspond to two purely ultra- fast electronic phase transitions, appearing only in the pho- toinduced ultrafast band shifts of the dyz-orbit-derived band within our time and energy resolution.
By comparing the ultrafast photoexcited and equilibrium-temperature-induced band energy-shifts, we found an anomalously large contribu- tion to the nematic electronic states from the structural transi- tion.5 W.T.Z. acknowledges support from the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFA1401800 and 2021YFA1400202) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11974243 and 12141404) and addi- tional support from a Shanghai talent program.

(c) and (d), the photoemission spectra from the cuts shown in (a) and (b), respectively.
(e) and (f), Pump fluence and temperature dependent energy shift of the dyz bands for the two cuts in (a) and (b), respectively.
Supplemental Discussion #1  To elaborate the Fc1 and Fc2 appearing in the ultrafast measurement more clearly, we estimated the transient electronic temperature (Te) by  fitting the momentum-integrated EDCs to Fermi-Dirac functions convoluted by the instrumental resolution (Supplemental FIG. 1).
After the photoexcitation ~ 0.2 ps, Te increases as enhancing the optical excitation fluence, and it shows that Te at Fc1 and Fc2 are consistent with the Ts (~90 K) and TM (~120 K), respectively, within error bars.
Since the nematic phase and orbital order are purely electronic origin, there should be transitions with enhancing the electronic temperature with ultrafast photoexcitation.
The quantitatively consistence between the transient electronic temperatures at the Fc1 and Fc2 and the equilibrium transition temperatures Ts and TM strongly suggests that the Fc1 and Fc2 are the two critical pump fluences driving the two electronic phase transitions.
Supplemental Discussion #2  It is generally believed that in FeSe there is an orbital order, which corresponds to the degeneracy of dxz and dyz orbits (50~60 meV) at a specific temperature, and the orbital order is the driven force of the nematic phase transition at Ts.
Such a degeneracy of dxz and dyz orbits has been widely confirmed at M point from equilibrium ARPES experiments ([S1]–[S4]).
However, some results suggest that the  temperature of the degeneracy and the nematic phase transition are at a similar temperature ([S1], [S2]), while some publications suggest a higher temperature for the degeneracy than the Ts ([S3], [S4]).
Such a degeneracy at TM is also evidenced in the few-layer FeSe sample ([S5], [S6]).
The temperature scale associated with the degeneracy of dxz and dyz bands is also evidenced near the Gamma point ([S5]).
From previous studies, the TM is the critical temperature of the formation of the orbital order, and the order parameter associated in the transition can be the band gap between the dxz and dyz bands ([S7],[S8]).
In the modified Fig. 4(a), the kink feature at TM is robust in different samples, different momentum cut directions, and different probe photon energies.
To our knowledge, it is the first time to identify both the TM and Ts in a single temperature dependent band evolution (Figure 4), strongly suggesting that there is another temperature scale above the nematic transition temperature Ts.
Importantly, the value of the TM from the measurement near the Gamma point here is consistent with that the recent studies at the M point.
However, the TM has not ever been evidenced in the transport measurements.
It is possibly due to the fact that the band gap is tens of meV below the Fermi energy and it has less contribution to the conduct carriers, making it is hard to resolve the TM experimentally in transport measurement.
In a recent study, TM was signatured as a peak in the dρ/dT curve but not discussed ([S9]).
Supplemental Discussion #39 In Supplemental FIG.
2, we show the measurements on two different spots, and we also used s- and p-polarized incident light to minimize the possible intensity contribution from the other domains, which are twofold symmetric and elliptical, rotated to each other by 90° and elongated along the X and Y directions, respectively.
The corresponding band structures along the high-symmetry degree, labelled by dark red cuts in panels (a) and (b), are displayed in panels (c) and (d).
We can see that in the p-pol measurements, only information of dyz-orbit characterized band could be extracted due to the weak spectral weight contribution for the dxz - and dz2 - orbit bands.
We took additional fluence- and temperature-dependent measurements on the two domains in panels (e) and (f), in which the results show good consistence between the two cuts for both of the fluence and temperature dependent measurements.
