The samples have been grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy and characterized by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy; high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with capabilities allowing for chemical analysis, including the annular dark-ﬁeld mode and electron energy loss spectroscopy; high-resolution and synchrotron x-ray diﬀraction; syn- chrotron extended x-ray absorption ﬁne-structure; synchrotron x-ray absorption near-edge structure; infra-red optics and electron spin resonance.
The results of high resolution magnetic measurements and their quantitative interpretation have allowed to verify a series of ab initio predictions on the possibility of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic insulators and to demonstrate that the interaction changes from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic when the charge state of the Mn ions is reduced from 3+ to 2+.
I. INTRODUCTION The decisive role of holes in ordering the localized spins in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) is not only well established,1–3 but it represents also the basis of the functionalities demonstrated for these systems.4 In view of the fact that most magnetic insulators are either antiferromagnets or ferrimagnets, particularly intriguing is the question whether ferromagnetism is at all possi- ble in dilute magnetic insulators, where carriers remain strongly localized on parent impurities or defects.3,5,6 Ac- tually, a ferromagnetic coupling between localized spins was predicted in a series of ab initio works for the model system (Ga,Mn)N,7 where, as shown in Fig. 1, a large value of the ferromagnetic exchange energy Jnn was cal- culated for the nearest neighbor (nn) Mn pairs.
Due to the highly localized character of the orbitals in ques- tion, the magnitude of J is expected to decay fast with the inter–spin distance.
Nevertheless, according to recent Monte Carlo simulations, the predicted Curie tempera- ture TC is as high as 35 K and 65 K for the Mn cation concentration x = 3% and 6%, respectively.3 As reviewed elsewhere,8–10 this clear-cut theoretical prediction has not been yet veriﬁed experimentally.
In- stead, a diversity of magnetic properties has been re- ported.
For instance, no indication of ferromagnetic in- teractions was detected up to x = 36% in polycrystalline ﬁlms prepared by ion-assisted deposition,11 whereas TC values ranging from 8 K (Ref. 12) up to over 300 K (Ref. 8) were found for (Ga,Mn)N grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
However, the detection of phase separations13–16 may suggest that the determined TC corresponds to the blocking temperature of magnetic 2001 2004 2007 2010 0 20 40 60 a b c d d e f f h i k l m n o p q s s t t u v w l j Year of publication Exchange energy J nn  (meV) g r H nn =   J nn S 1 S 2     |S|=2 _ FIG.

It is increasingly clear that a further progress in the understanding of this challenging system requires a precise control of both the spatial distribution and the charge state of the Mn ions.9 The samples whose properties are discussed in this paper have been grown by matalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) according to a procedure described in Sec. II. As detailed in Sec.
III, our ﬁlms have been characterized by: secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS); high-resolution (scanning) transmission elec- tron microscopy [HR-(S)TEM] with capabilities allow-2 ing for chemical analysis, including the energy disper- sive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), high angle annular dark- ﬁeld (HAADF) mode, and electron energy loss spec- troscopy (EELS); high-resolution and synchrotron x- ray diﬀraction (SXRD); synchrotron extended x-ray ab- sorption ﬁne-structure (EXAFS); synchrotron x-ray ab- sorption near-edge structure (XANES); infra-red optics and electron spin resonance (ESR).
This set of probes demonstrates the absence of precipitation, reveals a non- uniform Mn distribution in the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, and shows that the concentration of Mn2+ ions reaches 4×1020 cm−3 in (Ga,Mn)N:Si.
From four probe conduc- tance measurements, the sheet resistance is of the order of 10 GΩat 300 K for the (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlm with the high- est Mn content x = 3.1%, where x is the concentration of Mn cations.
By combining this extensive growth and nanochar- acterization program with the results of high-precision magnetic measurements discussed in Sec.
IV we demon- strate that the dominant interactions between neighbor Mn pairs are ferromagnetic in (Ga,Mn)N.
However, ac- cording to the data, the coupling is too short-ranged to lead to magnetic ordering above 1.85 K in the studied Mn concentration range up to x = 3%.
Employing a model of magnetic susceptibility suitable for wurtzite (Ga,Mn)N at high temperatures, and outlined in the Appendix, we evaluate from our experimental results the magnitude of the exchange energy for the nearest neighbor ferromag- netic coupling.
These ﬁndings allow to verify the series of ab initio predictions summarized in Fig. 1 on the pos- sibility of ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic insulators.
At the same time, we show that the interactions become antiferromagnetic if the Mn charge state is altered by co- doping with Si donors, clarifying in this way the array of magnetic properties reported for this system. II.
GROWTH METHOD AND STUDIED SAMPLES In order to increase the Mn concentration in (Ga,Mn)N grown on GaN/c-sapphire by MOVPE at a substrate temperature of 850◦C,17 here the ﬂow–rate of the Ga pre- cursor (TMGa) is reduced to 1 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm), maintaining the temperature of the Mn precursor source (MeCp2Mn) at 22◦C and its ﬂow rate up to 490 sccm.
In addition to the uniformly doped Mn ﬁlms, we also grow digitally (δ) Mn-doped structures, in which the Mn and Ga precursors are supplied alter- nately with a period ratio up to 8.
Furthermore, a series of respectively uniformly and digitally Mn-doped sam- ples is co-doped with Si at a SiH4 ﬂow rate of either 1 or 2 sccm.
The four types of considered samples are denoted by (Ga,Mn)N, (Ga,δMn)N, (Ga,Mn)N:Si, and (Ga,δMn)N: Si respectively, where with δMn we refer to the Mn-digitally doped layers.
In Table I the list of the studied samples is presented, whose magnetic properties are reported in Figs. 11 and 12 Sample Label Mn x(av) Thickness Ga Mn Si # (%) (nm) 966 (Ga,Mn)N 0.5 470 5 490 0 1069 (Ga,δMn)N 1.8 140 5 δ-490 0 1071 (Ga,δMn)N 2.6 135 5 δ-490 0 1080 (Ga,Mn)N 1.1 740 5 490 0 1106 (Ga,Mn)N 1.8 750 1 490 0 1130 (Ga,Mn)N 1.8 200 1 490 0 1134 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 1.8 220 1 490 2 1142 (Ga,Mn)N 3.1 230 1 490 0 1152 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 3.3 200 1 490 2 1159 (Ga,δMn)N 1.5 140 1 δ-490 0 1160 (Ga,δMn)N: Si 2.4 135 1 δ-490 2 1161 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 2.9 200 1 490 1 1268 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 2.0 232 1 400 2 1269 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 1.9 232 1 300 2 1273 (Ga,Mn)N:Si 0.49 780 5 490 2 1274 (Ga,Mn)N 0.53 780 5 490 0 TABLE I: Samples studied in this work with Mn cation con- centrations x and xav for the uniformly [(Ga,Mn)N] and dig- itally Mn-doped structures [(Ga,δMn)N], respectively, as de- termined by ﬁtting the magnetic model to the data obtained by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), as described in Sec. IV.
The total thickness of the Mn-doped layer and precursor ﬂow rates (in sccm) for the Ga, Mn, and Si containing precursors are also given.
The samples #1273 and 1274 have been grown on double-side epi-ready sapphire substrates suitable for optical transmission studies. (Sec. IV).
An additional series of samples has been grown onto double-side epi-ready substrates for optical trans- mission studies.
The Mn concentration x (xav for the digital structures), as determined by the near-saturation value of the in-plane magnetization M at 50 kOe and 1.85 K, reaches over 3% in the samples with the highest Mn content. III.
NANOCHARACTERIZATION A. Crystallinity The degree of crystallinity and possible precipitation of secondary crystallographic phases in uniformly and dig- itally Mn-doped ﬁlms have been assessed by HR-TEM, HR-STEM, HR-XRD, SXRD, and EXAFS.
Our TEM studies have been carried out for all studied ﬁlms on cross-sectional samples prepared by mechanical polishing followed by Ar+ ion milling, under a 4◦angle at 4 kV for less than 2 h. The ion polishing has been performed in a Gatan 691 PIPS system.
The specimens have been investigated in Linz using a JEOL 2011 Fast TEM microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan CCD camera.
The set-up is capable of an ultimate point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm, with the possibility to image lattice fringes with a 0.14 nm resolution.
As reported in Fig. 2, for both (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%) samples low resolution3 FIG.
2: Low-magniﬁcation TEM (left panel) and HR-TEM (right panel) for (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%, upper panels) and (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%, lower panels) without any evidence of crystallographic phase separation.
TEM (left panels) shows no crystallographic phase sep- aration and, in particular, no precipitates’ segregation near the surface or interface.
In fact, the HR-TEM im- ages (right panels) clearly reveal the atomic positions in the lattice and, on the scale displayed, they show a ho- mogenous crystal ordering and no signs of precipitation within the Mn-doped layers.
To further verify the crystallographic homogeneity of the grown Mn-doped layers, HR-XRD measurements us- ing a Materials Research Diﬀractometer (MRD) and SXRD were performed.
The HR-XRD experiments have been carried out with a Panalytical X’Pert PRO MRD in Linz at the photon energy of the Cu Kα1 radiation (8 keV) using a hybrid monochromator with a 0.25◦slit for the incident optics and a pixel detector with an active length of 1 mm (19 channels) in the diﬀracted beam op- tics.
The SXRD experiments have been performed at the beamline BM20 (Rossendorf Beam Line) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble us- ing a point detector and 0.5 mm slits in front of the beam at an energy of 10 keV. Radial ω-2θ scans of the GaN (002) to the GaN (004) diﬀraction peak do not show any trace of secondary phases.
In Fig. 3 the radial scans ac- quired with both techniques for the same set of samples are shown for comparison, with the MRD scans in the upper panel and the SXRD in the lower one.
The sharp (002) and (004) diﬀraction peaks of GaN and the (006) diﬀraction of the sapphire substrate are observed for all samples.
The measurements carried out with the high energy monochromatic beam at the synchrotron show a better signal-to-noise ratio and less diﬀuse scattering, FIG.

when compared to those performed with the MRD, but in both cases no trace of crystallographic precipitation can be observed.
The narrow full-width at-half-maxima (FWHM) of the GaN (002) and (004) peaks (with values between 240 and 290 arcsec) indicate the high crystallinity of the layers.
From the GaN symmetric sharp diﬀraction peak from the Mn-doped samples – comparable to the one from the GaN reference – we have hints that Mn-doping does not aﬀect critically the dislocation density, as conﬁrmed by the HR-TEM analysis on the same samples.
The XAFS measurements at the Mn K-edge (6539 eV) have been carried out at the GILDA Italian collaborat- ing research group beam-line (BM08) of the ESRF in Grenoble, according to the experimental procedure de- tailed previously.17,18 Both EXAFS and XANES regions of the collected spectra have been analyzed.
Three representative samples have been studied: (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%), (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and (Ga,Mn)N:Si (x = 3.3%).
The collected data, with the polarization vector parallel to the c–axis, and the rela- tive ﬁts resulting from the EXAFS analysis are shown in Fig. 4.

The quan- titative results are reported in Table II and they are equivalent within the error bars for all the samples.
The agreement with experimental data is good up to several coordination shells – as seen in Fig. 4 – demonstrating the substitutional incorporation of Mn.
The presence of an additional Mn-Mn coordination can be excluded within an uncertainty of 0.4 neighbors.
Considering that the typical metal-metal coordination numbers are around 10 (12 Mn neighbors in MnN, 8 in Mn3N2) we can ex- clude the presence of secondary phases with a precision of about 5%.
In addition, the possible Mn incorporation in interstitial sites (tetrahedral and octahedral) has been investigated, statistically not improving the ﬁt quality.
These results are equivalent to the XAFS structural anal- ysis on our (Ga,Mn)N samples at lower concentrations.17 In conclusion, TEM, HR-(S)TEM, HR-XRD, SXRD, and EXAFS studies demonstrate a single-crystal char- acter of the considered ﬁlms with no traces, down to the atomic scale, of precipitations (crystallographic phase separation).
This is in contrast with the case of some (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms grown by MBE (Refs.
14,21) as well as with (Ga,Fe)N layers obtained by MOVPE (Refs.
18,22– 24), for which crystallographic phase separations were de- tected by employing the same nanocharacterization tools.
B. Mn distribution The Mn distribution along the growth direction and the Si distribution in the co-doped ﬁlms have been evaluated in Warsaw via SIMS, calibrated by Mn im- planted GaN, providing the absolute concentration of Mn TABLE II: Quantitative results of the EXAFS analysis.
For each sample, the ﬁtted parameters are: the common ampli- tude (S2 0), the average bond distances from the central Mn to the 4 N nearest neighbors (RMn−N) and 12 Ga next nearest neighbors (RMn−Ga) of the wurtzite structure plus a common expansion parameter for higher coordination shells (∆R) and the coordination number (NMn−Mn) for the Mn-Mn bond dis- tance at 2.98(2) ˚A.
The Debye-Waller parameters attest all below 8(2) × 10−3 ˚A−2 and a correlated Debye model20 with a temperature of 500(50) K is used for the GaN multiple scat- tering contributions.
Error bars are reported on the last digit.

The SIMS depth proﬁles reported previously17 for the samples with x ≲1% and the one shown in Fig. 5 for the present ﬁlms indicate that the Mn distribution is uniform over the Mn-doped region and that the interface between the (Ga,Mn)N overlayer and the GaN buﬀer layer is sharp.

The residual contamination by H, O, Fe, and Mg is also shown.
This is conﬁrmed by chemical analysis performed in Linz with an Oxford Inca EDS system, which—with the sensitivity of 0.1% at.—does not provide any evidence for Mn diﬀusion into the nominally undoped GaN buﬀer.
For further characterization of the Mn doping, HAADF-STEM and EELS measurements have been per- formed – and reported in Fig. 6 – employing a FEI Tecnai F 20 200kV transmission electron microscope in Graz.
The STEM images and EELS spectra could be recorded with an upgraded spectrometer with an adapted STEM detection geometry, optimized for Z-contrast and en-5 hanced spectral collection EELS eﬃciency.25,26 In order to improve the signal to noise ratio at the high spatial res- olution in question as well as to keep exposure times low for minimal sample drift, the EELS point spectra have been taken as an integral sum over the energy.
Accord- ingly, a possible ﬁne structure located within the ﬁrst 20–30 eV around the ionization threshold energy of an edge has been averaged out.
The HAADF-STEM on (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and re- ported in Fig. 6(a) reveals a clear change in intensity, when going from the substrate into the Mn-doped layer (from left to right), while within the doped layer no chem- ical contrast could be detected.
The EELS spectra given in Fig. 6(b) evidence the presence of Mn only in the nom- inally Mn-doped layer.
In contrast, remarkably, as shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(e), HAADF-STEM observations on the digital (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%) reveal intensity modulations.
Additional EELS point spectra collected in Fig. 6(d) show the signal diﬀerences of the Mn L23 edge between the substrate and the intensity modulated lines.
In conclusion, the element speciﬁc analysis demon- strates a spatially homogeneous Mn distribution over the volume of the uniformly Mn-doped (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms, with no segregation towards the surface, interface or buﬀer re- gions.
In contrast, in the case of the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, nano-scale density modulation with a period im- posed by the growth conditions has been detected, mean- ing that in these δMn samples the local Mn concentration ﬂuctuates between lower and higher x values around the xav determined by SQUID magnetometry.
As discussed in Sec.
IV, such a non-random distribution of Mn ions increases the apparent Curie constant, particularly if the system is close to a ferromagnetic instability.
C. Concentrations of Si and Mn2+ ions The incorporation and a uniform distribution of Si im- purities in (Ga,Mn)N:Si layers is evidenced by the SIMS result displayed in Fig. 5.
From the same measurements on all the considered samples, the Si concentration is found to be of the order of 1020 cm−3 for the Si and Ga precursor ﬂow rates 1 or 2 and 1 sccm, respectively.
Following recent works of the Mn charge state in GaN,27 the eﬀect of co-doping by Si donors on the Mn charge state has been quantitatively assessed by exam- ining the magnitude of the intra-ion optical absorption, which occurs at E0 ≈1.4 eV for Mn3+ ions in GaN.28–31 Optical investigations have been performed in Warsaw and in Linz for two series of ﬁlms, abridged in Table III, with the Mn concentrations x ≈1.8 and 0.5%, respec- tively, and diﬀerent Si content.
The series with the lower Mn concentration has been designed for transmission and ESR measurements with the layers deposited on double- side epi-ready sapphire substrates.
As it can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the Si dop- ing quenches the intra-ion absorption, speciﬁc to Ga- FIG.

We determine the concentration ratio of the absorb- ing Mn3+ ions for samples without and with Si by ﬁtting a model constructed within the transfer matrix formal- ism of optical transmission and reﬂectivity, taking into account the doped (Ga,Mn)N layer, the undoped GaN buﬀer, and the sapphire substrate.32 The contribution of the Mn3+ ions to the dynamic di- electric function is modeled by damped Lorentzian oscil-6 0.1  0.15  0.2  1.3  1.35  1.4  1.45  1.5 Reflectivity Energy (eV) Model (Ga,Mn)N:Si  0.1  0.15  0.2 950 925 900 875 850   Wavelength (nm) Model (Ga,Mn)N FIG.

The thicknesses of the GaN buﬀer and (Ga,Mn)N layer are adjusted to reproduce the observed Fabry-P´erot interferences at a magnitude of thicknesses ratio as determined during the growth by in-situ ellipsometry.
In Table III the ﬁtted values of the parameters in Eq. 1 are given.
From the reduction of the Mn3+ absorption we can evaluate the concentration of Mn2+ ions assuming that electrons coming from Si shallow donors occupy the Mn2+/Mn3+ midgap level.
Under this assumption, the concentration of Mn2+ ions reaches a level of 4×1020 per cm3 for the highest employed ﬂow of the Si precursor at the lowest Ga precursor ﬂow.
Results of ESR studies carried out in Linz and reported in Fig. 9 for (Ga,Mn)N and (Ga,Mn)N:Si with the Mn concentration x ≈0.5% demonstrate the emergence of a characteristic Mn2+ signal upon Si doping.
In ﬁlms with higher Mn concentrations, the line broadening, witness- ing the presence of Mn2+–Mn3+ coupling, as discussed in Sec.
IV, has hampered the detection of a Mn2+ signal.
A non-zero value of the orbital momentum, and the associated spin-orbit interaction speciﬁc to Mn3+ ions, precludes their observation by ESR (Ref. 27).
At the same time, Mn2+ ions, corresponding to orbital singlets, give rise to a speciﬁc ESR response.27,34 The results of the optical and ESR studies are con- ﬁrmed also by XANES.
In order to contribute to the determination of the Mn valence state, the position of the x-ray absorption edge and the pre-edge features have been considered as described in the XANES section of Ref. 17.
In particular here the issue of reduction of the charge state is addressed.
As it can be appreciated in Fig. 10, a shift towards lower energies is visible for the Si co-doped sample, while the position of the pre-edge peaks remains unchanged.
This demonstrates the ﬁne calibra- tion of the incoming energy and suggests the presence of7 Magnetic field (Oe) 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 (Ga,Mn)N:Si  ESR signal dA/dH (rel. units) (Ga,Mn)N  FIG.

some Mn in a valence state lower than 3+, possibly 2+.
Due to the lack of model compounds that would allow to establish a precise relation between the edge shift and the valence state in nitrides, a quantitative statement cannot be given here.
However, considering that in the case of 6-coordinated Mn ions (this example is taken as no data are reported for tetragonal Mn3+) the ionic ra- dius of Mn2+ is about 12% greater than the one of Mn3+ (Ref. 35) and that no visible evolution of the Mn-N dis- tance is reported, we can expect a minority of Mn ions to be in the 2+ charge state.

In conclusion, our SIMS, optical, XANES, and ESR studies show consistently that co-doping with Si increases the concentration of Mn ions in the 2+ charge state, which for the highest employed ﬂow of the Si precur- sor (2 sccm) and the lowest Ga precursor ﬂow is up to 4×1020 cm−3, about 30% of the total Mn concentration for x = 3%.
This evaluation substantiates the experimen- tal data presented in the next section.
It is worth noting that a co-existence of Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions was detected also in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in (Ga,Mn)N samples undoped with Si,36 pointing to the presence of residual or interfacial compensating donors. IV.
MAGNETIC PROPERTIES According to our previous studies of (Ga,Mn)N with x < 1%,17 the dependence of the magnetization M on temperature T , magnetic ﬁeld H, and its orientation with respect to the wurtzite (wz) c-axis can accurately be described in terms of non-interacting Mn3+ ions sub- stitutional of Ga.
The good agreement between the ex- perimental data and the model conﬁrms a weak com- pensation by residual impurities which, if present, would change the Mn charge state and thus the magnetic prop- erties.
The Mn3+ charge state is preserved in samples with higher Mn concentrations, where the persistence of a large anisotropy between the M(H) values at 1.85 K for the two sample orientations c ⊥H and c ∥H is evidenced in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b).
However, a grad- ual enhancement of M(H)/M(50 kOe) over the magni- tude expected for non-interacting spins is observed when increasing x up to 3% in both uniformly and digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms, as seen in Figs. 11(a), 11(b), and 12(a).
These results demonstrate univocally that, in spite of the absence of band carriers, the dominant exchange interac- tion between Mn3+ is ferromagnetic in (Ga,Mn)N. Interestingly, a rather diﬀerent behavior is observed in the case of (Ga,Mn)N:Si, where the trapping of donor electrons changes the Mn charge from 3+ to 2+ and the spin state S from 2 to 5/2, for about 30% of the Mn ions at x ≈3%, as discussed in Sec. IIIC.
According to the data collected in Figs. 11(c), 11(d), and 12(b) the increas- ing concentration of Mn2+ ions results in the foreseen decrease of the magnetization anisotropy.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 12(b), M(H) saturates slower than the- oretically anticipated for non-interacting Mn ions.
This ﬁnding points to an antiferromagnetic character of the exchange coupling between Mn2+ ions, and suggests that these ions may dominate in (Ga,Mn)N, when no ferro- magnetic interactions are detected.11,37 In the insets to Figs. 11(a)–11(d) the results of our search for the onset of a collective magnetic behavior in the samples with the highest Mn concentrations are given.
A linear and ahysteretic M(H) dependence in weak magnetic ﬁelds is observed for both conﬁgurations, c⊥H and c∥H, pointing to the absence of spontaneous magnetization.
These data imply that the ferromagnetic spin-spin couplings are too short–ranged to result in mag- netic ordering and, hence, in spontaneous magnetization at T ≥1.85 K.8 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 (b) (Ga, Mn)N x av = 2.6 %   -0.01 0 0.01 -0.015 0 0.015   -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0   (a) (Ga,Mn)N x = 3.1 % -0.01 0 0.01 -0.005 0 0.005   Magnetic field (kOe) Normalized magnetization (rel. units) 0 10 20 30 40 50 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 (d) (Ga,Mn)N:Si x = 3.3 % -0.01 0 0.01 -0.005 0 0.005   -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 (c) (Ga,Mn)N:Si x = 2.9 % -0.01 0 0.01 -0.005 0 0.005   FIG.

Quantitative information on Jnn is gained here by ex- amining the dependence on the inverse temperature of the in-plane magnetic moment m(T ) of Mn spins in GaN, as obtained by subtracting the value of m(T ) mea- sured independently for a sapphire substrate (normal- ized by the corresponding sample weight).
As reported in Fig. 13, χ(T ) ≡M/H ∼1/T for 150 ≲T ⩽350 K. This behavior indicates that the contribution to the mag- netic susceptibility from the (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms obeys the Curie law in this regime, χ(T ) = C/T .
This depen- dence is expected if the spin pairs are either uncorrelated |Jnn|S2 ≪kBT , or strongly bound |Jnn|S2 ≫kBT .
In order to extract from these data the magnitude of Jnn, we extend the previous model of a single substitu- tional Mn3+ impurity in GaN (Ref. 17) by considering a pair of Mn3+ ions coupled by an exchange interac- tion −J ⃗S1⃗S2,38,39 the model discussed in details in the Appendix.
Assuming a random distribution of Mn over the cation hcp lattice, and allowing for the coupling be- tween nn spins we can evaluate M(T, H) at a given Jnn and x.
This approach implies, in particular, that for x = 3%, T < 350 K, and H = 1 kOe, χ(T ) = C/T if Jnn > 10 meV. However, in this case, due to the propor- tionality of χ(T ) to the pair spin square, the magnitude of C is enhanced in comparison to the value C0 correspond- ing to non-interacting spins.
To evaluate experimentally Cnorm = C/C0, we consider that its magnitude can be determined from the magnetic moment m(T, 1 kOe) mea- 10 20 30 40 50 H   c 1.8% 1.9% 2.0% 2.9% 1 1 1 1   Magnetization (rel. units) Magnetic field (kOe) 0.1 1 (Ga,Mn)N:Si   (b) 3.3% x = S=5/2 10 20 30 40 50 3.1% 0.5% 1.1% 1 1 1   Magnetization (rel. units) Magnetic field (kOe) 0.1 1 (Ga,Mn)N   1.8% (a) H   c x = FIG.

Following the outcome of the experimental results for (Ga,Mn)N:Si (Sec. IIIC), demonstrating the presence of Mn2+ ions, their relative contribution to M(T, H) is de- termined from the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy.

samples, hinting to the presence of a considerable fer- romagnetic spin-spin interaction.
The theory presented in the Appendix describes quite well the magnitude of Cnorm(x) for the uniformly doped (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms, point- ing to Jnn > 10 meV, in general agreement with the results of the ab initio studies outlined in Fig. 1.
Fur- thermore, a low-temperature upturn of the experimental points over the C/T dependence, visible in Fig. 13 below ∼100 K, suggests the existence of an additional weak ferromagnetic coupling between more distant neighbors.
Moreover, the experimental values of Cnorm(x) in the case of digital δMn-doping are higher than theoretically ex- pected.
In order to clarify the diﬀerent magnitude of Cnorm in uniformly and digitally doped ﬁlms, we refer to Sec.
IIIB, where the detailed investigation of the Mn distribution for the two samples with the highest Mn concentra- tion, respectively (Ga,Mn)N (x = 3.1%) and the digi- tal (Ga,δMn)N (xav = 2.6%), have been shown.
The data demonstrate the presence of a spatially modulated Mn concentration in the digitally Mn-doped ﬁlms.
Due to a non-linear dependence of the Curie constant on the Mn concentration in the presence of ferromagnetic in- teractions, such a non-random distribution of Mn ions increases the apparent value of Cnorm, particularly if the system is close to a ferromagnetic instability.
This in- terpretation is supported by a much smaller eﬀect in the ﬁlms with lower values of xav, and thus far from the fer- romagnetic instability.
Finally, we comment on the magnitudes of Cnorm(x) in Si doped samples.
Here, we have ferromagnetically coupled Mn3+–Mn3+ and Mn3+–Mn2+ pairs as well as antiferromagnetically interacting Mn2+–Mn2+ pairs.
As shown in Fig. 14, the theory developed for such a case and summarized in the Appendix is consistent with the data for Si-doped samples.
V. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have veriﬁed experimentally the pres- ence of a strong ferromagnetic coupling between neigh- boring Mn spins in (Ga,Mn)N, supporting a very signif- icant number of ab initio studies.3,5,7 Since the Mott- Hubbard localization precludes carrier hopping between magnetic ions, a ferromagnetic super-exchange consti- tutes the relevant microscopic coupling mechanism.40 However, according to our ﬁndings, the range of this in- teraction is too short to produce a long-range ferromag- netic ordering – at least above 1.85 K – in samples with 3% of randomly distributed substitutional Mn cations.
Co-doping with Si may a priori result in a ferromag- netic double exchange, but apparently Anderson-Mott localization in the Mn impurity band renders this mech- anism ineﬃcient in the range of Mn contents explored so far by us.
If, owing to a large density of donor-like defects or impurities the concentration of Mn2+ prevails, antiferromagnetic super-exchange becomes the dominant spin-spin coupling mechanism.
This situation has pre- sumably taken place in recently studied (Ga,Mn)N ﬁlms with x up to 36% (Ref. 11) and a time ago in the case of In1−xMnxAs layers with x up to 18%.41 Acknowledgments The work was supported by FunDMS Advanced Grant of ERC (Grant No. 227690) within the Ideas 7th Frame- work Programme of European Community, InTechFun (Grant No.

Appendix: Theoretical evaluation of the Curie constant We evaluate the Curie constant Cnorm for a random distribution of the Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions.
While our model can be applied for a general situation, we dis- cuss the case describing our data in the relevant temper- ature range 150 ≲T ⩽350 K, i.e., we assume that the nearest neighbour (nn) Mn3+–Mn3+ and Mn3+–Mn2+ pairs form ferromagnetically oriented dimers, whereas nn Mn2+–Mn2+ pairs are uncoupled.
In the paramagnetic region well above the ordering temperature, (high temperature limit) the magnetic sus-10 ceptibility is expected to obey the Curie-Weiss law, χ = C0 T −θC (5.2) C0 = N (gµB)2S(S + 1) 3kB (5.3) where C and θC are the Curie constant and Curie-Weiss temperature, and N is the concentration of magnetic ions with spin S. However, in random magnetic alloys, where the interactions between spin pairs show a large dispersion owing to strong variations of the spin-spin dis- tances, the magnitudes of C and θC may depend on the temperature.38,39,42 We consider the case of dilute magnetic semiconduc- tors (DMSs) and dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs).
In the absence of band carriers that could mediate long range spin-spin interactions, the strength of the exchange cou- plings decays rather fast with the spin-spin distance.
In such a case, the exchange between magnetic ions occupy- ing the nn cation positions dominates.
Accordingly, be- low the percolation limit for the nn interaction (x ≲18% for fcc and hcp lattices), the magnetic response can be evaluated as a sum of contributions coming from various types of clusters: isolated spins, nn pairs, nn triads, ..., whose relative importance depends on x.39 The magnetic response of such small clusters can be easily calculated for given values of the exchange integral Jnn, tempera- ture T , and magnetic ﬁeld H. Possible interactions be- tween more distant pairs of magnetic ions are neglected within this approach.
Qualitatively, at low temperatures, kBT ≪|Jnn|, at which the nn pairs are locked, the Curie constant is reduced (C < C0) or enhanced (C > C0) for antiferromagnetic interactions (Jnn < 0) and ferromag- netic interactions (Jnn > 0), respectively.
We are interested in the case of (Ga,Mn)N and (Ga,Mn)N:Si where, in general, both Mn2+ (S = 5/2) and Mn3+ (S = 2) ions are present with the concen- trations xMn2+ and xMn3+, respectively (x = xMn2+ + xMn3+).
Here, we have ferromagnetically coupled Mn3+– Mn3+ and Mn3+–Mn2+ pairs as well as antiferromag- netically interacting Mn2+–Mn2+ pairs.
To describe this case, we generalize the approach put previously forward for II-VI DMSs.39 The probability that a given spin, e.g., a Mn3+ ion, is in a cluster belonging to the conﬁguration rcl is given by, Prcl = nrcl(xMn2+)nMn2+(xMn3+)nMn3+ −1(1 −x)υrcl , (5.4) where nMn2+ and nMn3+ are the numbers of manganese ions in 2+ and 3+ charge states belonging to this clus- ter and nrcl, υrcl are parameters taken from Refs. 39 and 43.
Then one should take into account all possible com- binations of arrangements of Mn2+ ions within rcl and calculate the total spin Scl corresponding to the ground state (assuming that |Jnn| ≫kBT ).
In the case of van- ishing interactions between Mn2+ ions we have to com- pute also the eﬀective cluster size ncl (some of the ions may be disconnected from the initial cluster because of JMn2+−Mn2+ = 0 ).
In this way we obtain the probabil- ity matrix PScl,ncl from which the Curie constant can be calculated, C = xN0 (gµB)2 3kB X Scl,ncl PScl,nclScl(Scl + 1) ncl , (5.5) where N0 is the cation concentration.
In order to obtain the magnetization M(T, H) of (Ga,Mn)N in the presence of interacting nn magnetic centers, we extend the previous model of a single sub- stitutional Mn3+ impurity in GaN (Refs. 17,29,44) by considering a pair of Mn3+ ions coupled by an exchange interaction H(12) = −Jnn⃗S1⃗S2.
Then, the energy struc- ture of such a pair can be described by the Hamiltonian H = H(1) + H(2) + H(12), (5.6) where H(i) (i = 1, 2) accounts for the single Mn3+ ion (L = 2, S = 2) in GaN with the trigonal crystal ﬁeld of the wurtzite structure and the Jahn-Teller dis- tortion taken into account (for details, see Ref. 17).
In the coupling scheme employed, the base states for the pair are characterized by the set of quantum numbers | mL1, mS1, mL2, mS2⟩.
The energy level scheme is calcu- lated by a numerical diagonalization of the full 625 × 625 Hamiltonian (5.6) matrix, which allows to obtain an av- erage magnetic moment of the Mn ion belonging to the pair (mpairs).
Assuming a random distribution of Mn ions over the cation sites (the hcp lattice) and allowing for the coupling between the nn spins we can then eval- uate M(T, H) at given Jnn and x, M = µBxN0[⟨msingles⟩Pncl=1 + ⟨mpairs⟩(1 −Pncl=1)].
