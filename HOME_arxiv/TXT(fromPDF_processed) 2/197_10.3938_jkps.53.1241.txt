(Received September 13, 2021) Abstract We suggest a better mathematical method, fractional calculus, for studying the behavior of the atom-ﬁeld interaction in photonic crystals.
By studying the spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal with one-band isotropic model, we found that the long-time inducing memory of the spontaneous emission is a fractional phenomenon.
This behavior could be well described by the fractional calculus.
And the results show no steady photon-atom bound state for the atomic resonant transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed band edge which is encountered in the previous study [J. Opt.

The correctness of this result is validated by the “cut-oﬀsmoothing” density of photon states (DOS) with fractional calculus.
By obtaining a rigorous solution without the multiple-valued problem for the system, we show the method of fractional calculus has logically concise property.

In light-emitting diodes and lasers, for example, spontaneous emission that is not extracted from the devices will contribute to loss and noise.
Inhibiting undesirable spon- taneous light emission and redistributing the energy into useful forms becomes important in these ﬁelds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally [6, 7] that photonic bandgap (PBG) materials could be eﬀectively used to inhibit the spontaneous emission.
Near a photonic band edge, the photon density of state (DOS), which determines the rate of spontaneous emission, is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of free space.
Singu- larity [8] of the DOS near PBG leads to the strong atom-ﬁeld interaction and formation of photon-atom bound states [9, 10], where the spontaneous emission rate is inhibited.
The Markov approximation [11] of spontaneous emission in free space is no longer valid in this near PBG region, where the atomic decay becomes non-exponential and the emission spec- trum becomes non-Lorentzian.
By using two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals, Fujita et al. [12] successfully inhibited and redistributed the spontaneous light emission by a factor of 5 as a result of the 2D photonic bandgap eﬀect.
The experimental data clearly indicate that the spontaneous emission rate has non- exponential decaying behavior when the emission peak is located near the band edges (lattice constant a=480 and 390 nm in Fig. 3) of Ref. 11.
This non-Markov behavior of the PBG reservoir had been studied by John et al. [9, 10, 13] using the Laplace transform method to solve the time evolution integral equation of the excited probability amplitude of an atom in a high-Q microcavity with singular DOS.
They showed that the time evolution of the excited-state population exhibits decay and oscillatory behavior before reaching a nonzero steady-state value due to photon localization [9, 10].
This bound dressed state leads to the fractionalized steady-state atomic population in the excited state.
This behavior is observed as the prolonged lifetime eﬀect in Ref. 12.
However, John et al. [13, 14] predicted that the unphysical bound state is present even when the resonant atomic frequency lies outside the band gap.
This is inconsistent with the experimental result that the prolonged-lifetime eﬀect will disappear when emission peak lies outside the PBG region.
This inconsistency may be caused by the multiple-valued problem countered in the studies [13] and by the singular DOS which is appropriate for high-Q mi- 2crocavity but not suitable for PBG reservoir with more smooth DOS near band edge.
The time evolution of the probability amplitude of excited level of an atom is related to the delay Green function or memory kernel G(t −t′) [8, 11], which is a measure of the reser- voir memory on the excited atom.
The resultant Green function depends very strongly on the photon density of states of the relevant photon reservoir.
The density of states near the band edge in the isotropic one-band model has the form of ρ(ω) ∝(ω −ωc)−1/2, where the square-root singularity is a characteristic of a one-dimensional phase space.
The correspond- ing memory kernel [8] has the same form of square-root singularity: G(t −t′) ∝(t −t′)−1/2.
Such a square-root singularity makes the resultant memory kernel possessing the long-time memory eﬀect.
That is, there is no time scale to separate the microscopic levels from the macroscopic levels.
The long-time memory phenomena have attracted a great attention in statistical physics.
This stochastic property of temporal degree of freedom can be well de- scribed by fractional calculus [15, 16, 17].
The fractional calculus becomes popular in which a diﬀusion process generated by a ﬂuctuation with no time scale at the macroscopic level.
This anomalous diﬀusion process can be further described by fractional Langevin equation [18, 19].
In this paper, we applied the fractional calculus to study the dynamics of the spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal.
We derived a fractional Langevin equation for this system and solved it to obtain the excited-state probability density.
The solution produced by he fractional (inverse) Laplace transform [20, 21, 22] is expressed in terms of the square complex variables.
There is no multiple-valued problem encountered in the previous studies [13, 14].
This rigorous mathematical method shows that no steady photon-atom bound state exists for the atomic resonant transition frequency lying in the allowed band.
We veriﬁed the correctness of this fact by using the “cut-oﬀsmoothing” DOS [23] with fractional calculus for the atomic transition frequency lying in the proximity of the allowed band edge.
The excited-state probability of this result still show decaying characteristics.
Fractional calculus gives the correct description of the behavior for the system near the band edge either with or without the “cut-oﬀsmoothing” DOS.
It not only resolves the multiple-valued problem but also avoids choice of smoothing parameter.
Therefore, we suggest that the behavior of the atom-ﬁeld interaction in photonic crystals should be expressed in terms of the fractional calculus. 3II.
THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPONTANEOUS EMISSION The system we investigate is a two-level atom coupled to the radiation in a photonic crys- tal with one-band isotropic model.
In a rotating-wave approximation, the total Hamiltonian for the coupled atom-ﬁeld system can be written as H = ¯hω21σ22 + X ⃗k ¯hω⃗ka+ ⃗k a⃗k + i¯h X g⃗k(a+ ⃗k σ12 −σ21a⃗k) (1) where σij = |i⟩⟨j| (i,j=1,2) are the atomic operators for a two-level atom with excited state |2⟩, ground state |1⟩, and resonant transition frequency ω21; a⃗k and a+ ⃗k are the annihi- lation and creation operators of the radiation ﬁeld; ω⃗k is the radiation frequency of mode ⃗k in the reservoir, and the atom-ﬁeld coupling constant g⃗k = ω21d21 ¯h [ ¯h 2ǫ0ω⃗kV ] 1 2 ˆe⃗k · ˆud is assumed to be atomic position-independent with the ﬁxed atomic dipole moment ⃗d21 = d21ˆud, the sample volume V , polarization unit vector ˆe⃗k of reservoir mode ⃗k, and the Coulomb constant ǫ0.
In the single photon sector, the wave function of the system has the form |ψ(t)⟩= A(t)e−iω21t|2, {0}⟩+ X ⃗k B⃗k(t)e−iω⃗kt|1, {1⃗k}⟩ (2) with initial condition A(0) = 1 and B⃗k(0) = 0.
Here A(t) labels the probability amplitude for the atom in its excited state |2⟩with an electromagnetic vacuum state and B⃗k(t) for the atom in its ground state |1⟩with a single photon in mode ⃗k with frequency ω⃗k.
We got the equations of motion for the amplitudes by projecting the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation on the one-photon sector of the Hilbert space as d dtA(t) = − X g⃗kB⃗k(t)e−iΩ⃗kt (3) d dtB⃗k(t) = g⃗kA(t)eiΩ⃗kt (4) with detuning frequency Ω⃗k = ω⃗k −ω21.
By substituting the time integration of Eq. (4) into Eq. (3), we have the time evolving equation of the excited-state probability amplitude d dtA(t) = − Z t 0 G(t −τ)A(τ)dτ (5) 4with the memory kernel G(t −τ) = P k g2 ⃗ke−iΩ⃗k(t−τ) = β 3 2 R ρ(ω)e−i(ω−ωc)dω.
We could observe from this equation that the memory kernel is a measure of the reservoir’s memory in its previous state.
The system evolves proceeding according to this equation.
Our studying aim, the dynamics of the spontaneous emission, could be obtained by solving the time evolving equation (5).
Here we applied fractional calculus and fractional Laplace transform to solve this equation, which were shown to have the form of fractional Langevin equation.
We adopted the isotropic one-band model to determine the memory kernel in equation (5), which is given as G(t −τ) = β3/2 1 (t−τ)1/2 e−i[π/4−∆c(t−τ)] with t > τ in the long time limit [8].
Here ∆c = ω21 −ωc is the detuning frequency of the atomic resonance frequency ω21 from the band edge ωc and β3/2 1 = (ω7/2 21 d2 21)/(12π3/2¯hǫ0c3) is the coupling constant.
By substituting this memory kernel to Eq. (5), making a transformation A(t) = ei∆ctC(t), and applying the deﬁnition of the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀerentiation operator [20, 21, 22], we got the fractional form of the time evolving equation as d3/2 dt3/2C(t) + i∆c d1/2 dt1/2C(t) + √πβ3/2 1 e−iπ/4C(t) = − 1 2√πt−3/2, (6) which is deﬁned to be a fractional Langevin equation of this atom-ﬁeld interaction system.
We proceeded to solve the probability amplitude C(t) by performing (inverse) Laplace transform on this fractional Langevin equation.
It gave C(t) = 3 X n=1 an  Et(−1 2, X2 n) + XneX2 nt  , (7) where Et(α, a) = tα P∞ n=0 (at)n Γ(α+n+1) is the fractional exponential function of order α, Xn are the roots of X3 + i∆cX −(iβ)3/2 = 0, and an are Xn-related coeﬃcients.
Xn and an are expressed as X1 = β1/2(η+ + η−)eiπ/4, (8) X2 = β1/2(η+e−iπ/6 −η−eiπ/6)e−iπ/4, (9) X3 = β1/2(η+eiπ/6 −η−e−iπ/6)ei3π/4, (10) with β3/2 = β3/2 1 √π, η± =  1 2 ± 1 2 v u u t   1 + 4 27 ∆3 c β3 !1/3  (11) and an = Xn (Xn −Xj)(Xn −Xm)(n ̸= j ̸= m; n, j, m = 1, 2, 3).
(12) 5We have the dynamics of spontaneous emission for the system by plotting the excited-state probability density P(t) = |A(t)|2 = |C(t)|2, which has no multiple-valued problem.
This probability amplitude could be further expressed by error function as A(t) = ei∆ct 3 X n=1 an(Xn + Yn(Erf( q X2 nt)))eX2 nt (13) with Yn = q X2n(n = 1, 2, 3), which is the result of previous studies [13, 14].
However, this expression has multiple-valued problem because the square roots of complex numbers X2 n will introduce multiple-valued complex numbers to Yn.
When the numerical results are shown, every complex sheet of X2 n has to be checked one by one to avoid errors.
Obviously, our results of fractional calculus are mathematically rigorous and concise.
Besides, our result in Fig. 1 shows that there is no steady photon-atom bound state for the atomic transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed band edge which is very diﬀerent from the results of previous studies [13, 14].
In order to fortify the accuracy of the result of no unphysical photon-atom bound state in the allowed band, we proceeded through applying the ”cut-oﬀsmoothing” density of state (DOS) to investigating the behavior of the system near the allowed band edge [23].
As mentioned before, DOS in isotropic single band model ρ(ω) ∝(ω −ωc)−1/2θ(ω −ωc) with Heaviside step function θ has a weak singularity for ω →ωc (near band edge).
This singular behavior is treated by ”cut-oﬀsmoothing DOS” ρs(ω) ∝limǫ→0 (ω−ωc)1/2 (ω−ωc+ǫ) θ(ω−ωc) in realistic photonic crystals [23].
Here ǫ is smoothing parameter and the superscript s denotes the ”cut- oﬀsmoothing DOS” case.
The excited-state probability amplitude As(t) = ei∆ctCs(t) could be exactly solved by performing Laplace transform on the memory kernel and time evolving equation (5).
These procedures gave the Laplace transform of probability amplitude Cs(t) as ˜Cs(s) = 1 s + i∆c + ˜G(s) (14) with ˜G(s) = β3/2e−iπ/4 √s+ √ iǫ .
This expression could be further rewritten in terms of the roots, Xs n(n = 1, 2, 3), of z3 + √ iǫz2 + i∆cz + (i √ iǫ∆c −β3/2i3/4) = 0 as ˜Cs(s) = √s + √ iǫ Q3 n=1(√s −Xsn) = 3 X n=1 as n √s −Xsn , (15) where Xs 1 = β1/2(ηs + + ηs −)eiπ/4 − √ iǫ 3 (16) 6Xs 2 = β1/2(ηs +e−iπ/6 −ηs −eiπ/6)e−iπ/4 − √ iǫ 3 (17) Xs 3 = β1/2(ηs +eiπ/6 −ηs −e−iπ/6)ei3π/4 − √ iǫ 3 (18) with ηs ± =  χ 2 ± √ξ 2 !1/3 , χ = 1 −2 3 ∆c √ǫ β3/2 −2 27 ǫ3/2 β3/2, ξ = χ2 + 4 27  ∆c −ǫ/3 β !3 (19) and as n = Xs n + √ iǫ  Xsn −Xs j  (Xsn −Xsm) (n ̸= j ̸= m; n, j, m = 1, 2, 3) (20) Here again we used fractional calculus (fractional inverse Laplace transform) to obtain the excited-state probability amplitude As(t) = ei∆ct 3 X n=1 as n  Et(−1 2, (Xs n)2) + Xs ne(Xs n)2t  (21) As we study how the system behaves near the allowed band edge, we choose the detuning frequency ∆c = 0.3β with smoothing parameter ǫ = 10−3, 10−5, 0, respectively in Fig. 2.
It could be observed that the excited-state probability density P s(t) = |As(t)|2 has small oscillatory behavior in the short time regime but approaches zero in the long time limit.
It means that there is really no steady photon-atom bound state for the atomic transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed band edge.
Actually, we have plotted all the behavior of the system inside the allowed band in Fig. 3.
For the atomic resonant transition frequency located deep inside the allowed band (∆c/β1 = 10) or very close to the band edge (∆c/β1 = 0.01), we found that these probabilities all show decaying characteristics in the long time limit.
That is, the photon located within the allowed band will not strongly interact with atom so the photon-atom bound state will not be formed.
This result could be veriﬁed analytically from the mathematical expression of the excited-state probability amplitude As(t) = ei∆ct P3 n=1 as n h Et(−1 2, (Xs n)2) + Xs ne(Xs n)2ti .
For the positive detuning (inside the allowed band ∆c > 0), both terms in the square bracket will asymptotically cancel out each other as time approaches inﬁnity (t →∞).
We get correct depiction of the dynamics of spontaneous emission in a PBG reservoir through fractional calculus, which is proposed as a better mathematical method to study the behavior of the atom-ﬁeld interaction in photonic crystals. 7III.
CONCLUSION The dynamics of the spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal with one-band isotropic band structure can be treated by the fractional calculus using either singular or ”cut-oﬀsmoothing” density of photon states.
For the ﬁrst time to our knowledge we show that it is a fractal phenomenon that induces the long-time memory of the spontaneous emis- sion in the photonic crystal.
Solving the time evolving equation of the probability amplitude for the system governed by the fractional memory kernel described by singular density of states, we obtained rigorous solutions without multiple-valued problem encountered.
Be- sides, we found that there is no unphysical state of fractionalized atomic population in the excited state when the resonant atomic frequency lies in the allowed band, even extremely close to the band edge.
This result was validated by the ”cut-oﬀsmoothing DOS” with frac- tional calculus.
We suggest that the correct description of the dynamics of the spontaneous emission in a photonic crystal should be expressed in terms of the fractional calculus.
This mathematical method, concerned about the isotropic model here, can be easily extended to the anisotropic ones and to study interesting eﬀects such as the enhancement of the index of refraction with greatly reduced absorption, electromagnetically induced transparency, and optical ampliﬁcation without population inversion.
