arXiv:cond-mat/0502184v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  11 May 2005 Electric ﬁeld control and optical signature of entanglement in quantum dot molecules Gabriel Bester and Alex Zunger National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden CO 80401 (Dated: September 19, 2018) The degree of entanglement of an electron with a hole in a vertically coupled self-assembled dot molecule is shown to be tunable by an external electric ﬁeld.
Using atomistic pseudopotential calculations followed by a conﬁguration interaction many-body treatment of correlations, we calculate the electronic states, degree of entanglement and optical absorption.
We offer a novel way to spectroscopically detect the magnitude of electric ﬁeld needed to maximize the entanglement.
PACS numbers: 78.67.Hc, 73.21.La, 03.67.Mn A pair of quantum dots or “quantum dot molecule” (QDM) occupied by two electrons [1, 2] or by an electron- hole pair [3] have been offered [1, 2, 3] as a basis for quan- tum computing.
The fundamental requirement for such quantum algorithm is the availability of entangled states and the ability to entangle and disentangle the quantum bits (qubits).
In the context of a dot molecule, an entangled electron-hole pair can be represented by the the maximally entangled Bell state eThT + eBhB, where e and h stand for the electron and the hole (the two qubits) and T and B for their localizations in top or bottom dot.
The origi- nal proposal [3] and subsequent experiments [3, 4, 5] for entangled electron-hole pairs in QDMs promised a high degree of entanglement [3] based on analysis via simple models.
However, later theoretical work showed [6] that electron-hole entanglement is generally low in such cases and develops a sharp maximum only at a speciﬁc interdot separation that critically depends on the size difference of the two dots.
Unfortunately, it has proven to be difﬁcult to experimentally control so precisely the interdot distance and the size difference of the two dots.
The question we address here is whether the degree of entanglement can be maximized by other means, more accessible experimen- tally than a variation of the interdot separation.
We pro- pose and quantify theoretically that it is possible to tune and control the degree of entanglement by applying an ex- ternal electric ﬁeld in the growth direction [7, 8, 9, 10].
The use of electric ﬁeld has been demonstrated in quantum dots [7, 8, 9, 10] and very recently in a single quantum dot molecules by Krenner et al. [11].
We predict that, while the entanglement at zero ﬁeld is generally low (35% for our case), it can reach a high value (75% in our case) at a speciﬁc electric ﬁeld FSmax (-5.4 kV/cm in our case).
Moreover, precisely at this ﬁeld the ﬁrst two exciton lines merge, giving a well deﬁned spectroscopic signature of the point of maximum entanglement.
In order to obtain reliable results for the correlated ex- citon states, it is of foremost importance to accurately account for the multi-band character of the hole states and for the correct strain dependence in the coupling re- gion (between the dots).
We have thus solved the perti- nent Schr¨odinger equation atomistically, in a multi-band fashion.
We use the Hamiltonian H = −1/2∇2 + P α,n vα(r −Rn) + VSO + |e|Fz under an external elec- tric ﬁeld F applied in [001] (z) direction.
The atomistic pseudopotentials vα of atom of type α and the non-local spin-orbit potential VSO are ﬁt to reproduce InAs and GaAs bulk properties [6, 12].
The atomic positions {Rn} are ob- tained by minimizing the atomistic strain energy (via va- lence force ﬁeld [13]) for a given shape and size of the dots.
Our quantum dots have a truncated cone shape (12 nm base and 2 nm height) with a composition ranging from pure InAs at the top to In0.5Ga0.5As at the base, as de- termined in Ref. [3].
The single-particle Hamiltonian is diagonalized in a basis Ψ = P n,k An,kφn,k of pseudopo- tential Bloch functions φn,k as outlined in Ref.
14, thus permitting coupling of various Bloch states.
Correlations are treated via a many-body expansion in Slater determi- nants [15, 16] where the electrons not included dynami- cally are represented by a model screening of the Coulomb and (long and short range) exchange [17].
The entangle- ment is calculated according to the von Neumann entropy of entanglement [18, 19].
The bonding (b) and antibonding (a) electron molecular levels of a dot molecule will be denoted as Ea, Eb.
For an idealized (mostly unrealistic) symmetric case the lowest energy molecular orbitals (MOs) develop from single-dot electron states eT and eB located on the bottom (B) and top (T) dots: ψ[Eb] = 1 √ 2 (eT + eB); ψ[Ea] = 1 √ 2 (eT −eB), (1) and similarly for the holes Ha, Hb.
As shown previ- ously [6, 20], in reality, because of strain and random- alloy ﬂuctuations, one does not have a symmetric bonding- antibonding behavior even if the dot molecule is made of identical (but non-spherical) dots.
This is seen in Fig. 1 where both electron and hole molecular orbital wave functions are shown for zero electric ﬁeld F = 0.
We see that the (lighter-mass) electrons tunnel between dots, forming bonding-antibonding states as in Eq. (1), but the (heavier-mass) holes remain localized on the top (bottom) dot for the bonding (antibonding) MO Hb (Ha).
The single-particle molecular orbital energy levels are shown in Fig. 2.
As we apply an electric ﬁeld the molecular lev-2 FIG.

We indicate the localization of the MOs on top and bottom dot by eT , eB, hT , hB. els that develop from the single-dot orbitals exhibit anti- crossing.
We have indicated in Fig. 2 the major character of the molecular states Ea, Eb, Ha, Hb in terms of the lo- calization on individual dots (eT , eB, hT and hB) using the calculated MO wave functions of Fig. 1.
We see that for holes at positive ﬁelds ψ(Ha) ≃hB and ψ(Hb) ≃hA while for electrons ψ(Ea) ≃eT and ψ(Eb) ≃eB.
The opposite is true for negative ﬁelds.
Thus, by applying an electric ﬁeld we can tune the localization of the MO’s and, for instance, compensate for size, composition or shape dif- ferences of both dots.
We will see that this tuning of local- ization will also control the degree of entanglement.
There are four transitions between the four molecular levels shown as vertical arrows in Fig. 2.
Their single- particle transition energies εi,j g (differences between the en- ergies from Fig. 2) are given in Fig. 3(a) and show maxima and minima vs ﬁeld.
We note in Fig. 3(a) the character of the four transitions in terms of localization on single- dot orbitals.
We see that at high ﬁelds, the lowest- and highest-energy transitions involve different dots: for exam- ple EbHb is eBhT at positive ﬁelds, and eT hB at negative ﬁelds.
Thus, the corresponding dipole transitions are ex- pected to be weak (“dark states”).
In contrast the second and third transitions at high ﬁelds involve the same dots: 1.29 1.30 1.31 1.32 SP Energy (eV) -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 Coulomb Energy (meV) 1.28 1.29 1.30 1.31 Energy (eV) -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 Electric Field in [001] direction (kV/cm) 1.28 1.29 1.30 1.31 CI Energy (eV) (c) Coulomb-Corrected (b) Electron-Hole Coulomb energy (d) Correlated Excitonic Energies (a) Single-Particle Transition Energies Single-Particle Transition Energies eThB eBhT eThB eBhT EbHb EbHa EaHb EaHa EaHb EbHb EbHa EaHa eBhT eThB eThB eBhT eThT eThT eBhB eBhB |4> |3> |2> |1> eThB eBhT eThB eBhT eThT eBhB EbHb EbHa EaHb EaHa FIG.

(d) Final correlated exciton results.
The bidot products (eT hT , etc...) are given whenever the MO states (given on the right) are strongly dominated by one of these products.
for example EbHa is eBhB at positive ﬁelds and eThT at negative ﬁeld.
Thus, the corresponding dipole transitions are expected to be large (“bright states”).
The single-particle approximation underlying Fig. 3(a) is valid only in the case of large ﬁelds, where e-h Coulomb effects are small compared to the ﬁeld-driven variation in the single-particle levels.
At these large ﬁelds, the excitons are pure determinants with localization on either eThT or eThB or eBhT or eBhB and therefore show no entangle- ment.
We will next see that in the interesting region of electric ﬁelds, e −h Coulomb interactions are crucial.
In Figure 3(b) we show the calculated electron-hole Coulomb interaction Je,h[i −j] = ZZ ψ⋆ i (ra)ψ⋆ j (rb)ψj(rb)ψi(ra) ǫ(ra, rb)|ra −rb| dra drb (2)3 between the MOs (i = Ea or Eb) and (j = Ha or Hb) using the model of Resta [17] for the screening ǫ.
This interaction Je,h (Fig. 3(b)) shows the reverse behavior vs ﬁeld compared with the MO energies εg vs ﬁeld [Fig. 3(a)].
For example, whereas Je,h[EbHb] is maximal (less neg- ative) at large positive or negative ﬁelds, and minimal at intermediate ﬁelds, the MO band gap εg[EbHb] is minimal at large positive or negative ﬁelds and maximal at inter- mediate ﬁelds.
Not surprisingly, when one calculates the Coulomb-corrected excitonic transition energy εi,j g + Ji,j e,h between the molecular states i and j [Fig. 3(c)] one sees a partial cancellation for the two low-energy transitions, EbHb and EbHa, leading to a weak dependence of the tran- sition energy on ﬁeld.
In contrast, inspection of Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for the two highest-energy transitions shows that the ﬁeld-dependence of εi,j g and Ji,j e,h reinforce each other, so the excitonic gap εi,j g + Ji,j e,h [Fig. 3(c)] has an ampliﬁed dependence on ﬁeld.
We conclude that the combination of εg and Je,h brings the lowest-energy transitions closer to each other, while pushing the two higher-energy transitions apart.
This will affect the correlation coupling between the MO’s, as seen next.
The Coulomb-corrected excitonic transition energies εi,j g + Ji,j e,h neglect the interactions between the different conﬁgurations, i.e., the states from Fig. 3(c) are not allow to interact.
This interaction is included in the next step via a conﬁguration interaction (CI)[15, 16] calculation in which we include all Coulomb and exchange integrals from the ﬁrst four electron and ﬁrst four hole states (including spin).
The results are shown in Fig. 3(d) as a function of elec- tric ﬁeld.
The lowest energy transitions (excitons |1⟩and |2⟩) have a very weak dependence on ﬁeld, similarly to the case without correlations [Fig. 3(c)].
In contrast to the per- turbative approach of Fig. 3(c) the states do not cross but anticrossing at -5.4 kV/cm, as expected from interacting states.
Similarly, |3⟩and |4⟩anticross at +3.6 kV/cm but in a more abrupt fashion.
To understand the correlated CI results we next ana- lyze |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, |4⟩by decomposing the correlated exci- tonic states into sums of products of single-dot states eT hT , eBhT , eT hB and eBhB called “bidot products” (see Ref. 19 for details).
The results of this decomposition are given in Fig. 4(a)(b) for states |1⟩and |2⟩as a function of the electric ﬁeld.
Fig. 4(c) shows the degree of entanglement calculated for the correlated CI wave functions using the von Neumann formula [6, 18] S = −Tr ρe log2 ρe, where ρe is the reduced density matrices of the electron.
When a state is made solely of a single bidot product such as eBhT it is unentangled, but when it is made of a coherent su- perposition, such as eBhB ± eThT , it might be entangled.
In the case of very strong positive ﬁelds (larger than 20 kV/cm), state |1⟩is purely eBhT (unentangled), as the ﬁeld pulls the electron to the bottom dot and the hole to the top dot.

main unentangled states at large ﬁelds.
The entanglement of |1⟩and |2⟩[Fig. 4(c)] reaches its maximum of around 75% at FSmax = -5.4 kV/cm.
At this ﬁeld the exciton states |1⟩and |2⟩are mainly composed of eT hT ± eBhB con- ﬁgurations, as shown in Fig. 4(a)(b) [23].
The calculated excitonic states of Fig. 3(d) are now used to calculate the absorption spectra in Fig. 5.
In Fig. 5 the oscillator strength is plotted for different values of the electric ﬁeld as a func- tion of the transition energy.
The plot shows a total of four transitions marked with |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, |4⟩. Since the tran- sitions |3⟩and |4⟩are weak, their position is marked by solid and open arrows respectively.
The transitions |1⟩and |2⟩(|3⟩and |4⟩) have a weak (strong) dependence on ﬁeld and show an anticrossings at ESmax (ESPT).
The spectra show that at ESmax the lowest energy exciton |1⟩becomes dark and progressively gains oscillator strength away from the anti-crossing.
The point of merging of |1⟩and |2⟩at the ﬁeld ESmax reﬂects a “resonant conditions” with maxi- mum entanglement (Fig. 4).
The distinct spectroscopic sig- nal of the anticrossing (where the lowest line progressively looses oscillator strength) occurs at the point of maximum entanglement and, we suggest, can give experimentalists a simple way to control a delicate quantity such as entangle- ment.4 Oscillator Strength 1.27 1.28 1.29 1.30 1.31 1.32 Transition Energy (eV) 18 kV/cm 9 kV/cm ESPT = 3.6 kV/cm -2.3 kV/cm ESmax = -5.4 kV/cm -7.2 kV/cm -9.0 kV/cm -13.5 kV/cm |1>|2> |3> |4> |1> |2> |3> |4> FIG.

(d) Adding elec- tron and hole hopping the the levels from (c) The physics underlying the “resonant condition”, that produces the high degree of entanglement, is revealed in Fig. 6 using the more intuitive basis of dot-localized or- bitals (as opposed to MO’s).
To obtain dot-localized or- bitals, we rotate the MO’s (that are delocalized over both dots) until the on-site Coulomb interaction is maximized [21].
This procedure yields single-particle energies of the dot-localized orbitals, denoted as eT, eB, hT and hB in Fig. 6(a).
Fig. 6(a) shows that at FSmax the energies of the dot-localized electron and hole orbitals are separated by 10 and 7 meV respectively with a gap of 1.3 eV. Generally, the energy separation between eT and eB and between hT and hB can reﬂect size, composition or shape differences of the two dots.
These differences can be tuned by the elec- tric ﬁeld.
Fig. 6(b) shows the energies of simple products of these electron and hole states.
They show two closely spaced levels (3 meV apart) in the center of the spectrum and two states 7 meV lower and higher in energy.
These energies are different from the MO’s energies of Fig. 3(a) that are combinations of eThT , eThB, eBhT and eBhB at this ﬁeld.
In the next step, in Fig. 6(c), the two-body Coulomb attraction is taken into account and lowers the eThT and eBhB states in such a way that they are about 14 meV below the eT hB state.
This is the consequence of a weak e −h binding for the dissociated excitons eT hB and eBhT .
Notably, the simple products eT hT and eBhB are energetically nearly degenerate at this level, this is the “resonant condition” mentioned above.
In the last step, in Fig. 6(d), the excitons |1⟩and |2⟩are now created by in- cluding the effects of electron and hole hopping that effec- tively produce correlated states.
The excitons |1⟩and |2⟩ are now a bonding- and antibonding-like combination of the energetically degenerate eT hT and eBhB states.
The excitons |1⟩and |2⟩are now split by a small energy of less than 1 meV.
This small splitting is conceptually very similar to the Davydov splitting [22] in molecular crystals.
The analysis also reveals that |1⟩is anti-symmetric (eThT - eBhB) and therefore optically dark while |2⟩is symmetric (eThT + eBhB) and optically bright.
The high symme- try of these states (purely symmetric and anti-symmetric) leads to the high degree of entanglement.
Any deviations from FSmax will lead to a less symmetric combinations as 1 √ 2(αeT hT + βeBhB) with α ̸= β with lower entangle- ment and smaller oscillator strength.
In conclusion, we showed that the degree of electron- hole entanglement in coupled quantum dots can be tuned by an external electric ﬁeld and that the point of maximum entanglement can be identiﬁed by measuring the photolu- minescence spectra, observing the merging of two peaks.
This opens new ways for experimentalists to identify the electric ﬁeld needed to achieve maximum entanglement in speciﬁc dot molecules.
We ﬁnally analyzed the nature of the excitons and revealed the interplay of single particle effects, direct Coulomb binding and electron and hole hop- ping on the many body levels.
We described how these effects conspire to yield a highly entangled state.

[23] In order for this e-h entanglement to be useful in a quan- tum computation scheme, the qubits need to be physically separated to be addressed individually.
One possibility for such a separation seems to be the use of in plane electric ﬁelds that would coherently drive the electron and hole to different neighboring quantum dots.
This would constitute the next experimental challenge
