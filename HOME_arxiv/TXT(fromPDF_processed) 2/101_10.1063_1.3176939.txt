arXiv:0906.5224v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  29 Jun 2009 Measurement of nonlinear frequency shift coeﬃcient in spin-torque oscillators based on MgO tunnel junctions Kiwamu Kudo,1, ∗Tazumi Nagasawa,1 Rie Sato,1 and Koichi Mizushima1 1Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, 212-8582, Japan (Dated: September 14, 2021) The nonlinear frequency shift coeﬃcient, which represents the strength of the transformation of amplitude ﬂuctuations into phase ﬂuctuations of an oscillator, is measured for MgO-based spin- torque oscillators by analyzing the current dependence of the power spectrum.
We have observed that linewidth against inverse normalized power plots show linear behavior below and above the oscillation threshold as predicted by the analytical theories for spin-torque oscillators.
The mag- nitude of the coeﬃcient is determined from the ratio of the linear slopes.
Small magnitude of the coeﬃcient (∼3) has been obtained for the device exhibiting narrow linewidth (∼10 MHz) at high bias current.
Spin-torque oscillators (STOs) emit a microwave sig- nal.
The signal originates in magnetization oscillations excited by bias dc current in a magnetoresistive (MR) device1,2.
In recent years, extensive studies have been carried out on STOs because they are a promising can- didate for an on-chip microwave oscillator3,4.
One of the important properties of an STO is its frequency nonlinearity, i.e., a frequency depends on an oscillation amplitude5,6.
Due to the property, the frequency of STO is tunable only by changing bias dc current, which is generally considered to be an advantage for applications.
The nonlinearity is, however, a disadvantage of STO when thermal ﬂuctuations are taken into account.
Ac- cording to the analytical theory of Kim et al.7, amplitude ﬂuctuations are transformed into phase ﬂuctuations be- cause of the nonlinearity, resulting in spectrum linewidth broadening.
The linewidth is a measure of the phase sta- bility of oscillation and it is preferable that it be narrow.
Estimating quantitatively the nonlinearity, which deter- mines the device performances, is therefore a key sub- ject for further developments of STOs.
According to the recent theories7,8,9,10,11,12, the quantity representing the degree of the nonlinearity is the normalized dimension- less nonlinear frequency shift coeﬃcient ν (regarding the deﬁnition of the coeﬃcient, see, e.g., Eq. (7) of Ref. 10 or Eq. (9) of Ref. 11).
In this letter, we report experimental estimations of the coeﬃcient ν in MgO-based STOs near threshold, which have not been directly addressed by pre- vious experiments.
Following some theoretical remarks, experimental results are shown.
It is theoretically known that the coeﬃcient ν has various values depending on magnetic environments and damping10,11,12.
In general, the coeﬃcient ν also depends on bias current10,12.
Considering that the variation of ν with bias current is small in the range near threshold, we treat ν as a constant independent of bias current.
First, we demonstrate numerically how large the coeﬃ- cient ν is in typical STOs.
A calculation example of ν at the threshold in a planar device with uniaxial anisotropy is shown in Fig. 1, representing the dependence on the magnitude and the angle of an in-plane external mag- netic ﬁeld.
The calculation is performed by the method FIG.
1: (Color online) Dependence of ν in the planar device with uniaxial anisotropy (x-direction) on the magnitude H and the in-plane angle φH of in-plane external magnetic ﬁeld.
The parameters chosen are an uniaxial anisotropy ﬁeld Hk = 200 Oe, a demagnetizing ﬁeld 4πMs = 8000 Oe, the Gilbert damping αG = 0.01, and the nonlinearity of damping13 q1 = 3.
In the notation used here, positive and negative ν denotes the red and blue frequency shift, respectively.
described in Ref. 11 which is based on the macrospin model.
We have used the typical STO parameters shown in the ﬁgure caption.
In the wide external ﬁeld region, |ν| is much larger than unity (|ν| ∼5-50).
On the black line shown in Fig. 1, the frequency nonlinearity vanishes (the nonlinearity due to the demagnetizing eﬀect cancels out that due to the in-plane anisotropy), where remarkable reduction of linewidth is expected12,14,15.
To estimate the value of ν from experiment, we have used the spectrum analysis method based on the theories of spectrum linewidth of STO under thermal ﬂuctuations7,8,9,10,11,12.
The method is similar to the one often used to measure the linewidth enhancement fac- tor (α-factor) in lasers16.
According to the theories, the linewidth shows asymptotic behavior below and above threshold.
In the region below threshold (the thermal activated oscillation region), the linewidth is given by ∆f < = ∆f0 × (kBT/Eosci).
(1) In the region above threshold (the current-induced oscil-2 FIG.

The units of linewidth and power are appropriately scaled.
lation region), the linewidth is given by ∆f > = ∆f0 × (kBT/Eosci) × (1 + ν2)/2, (2) in which the additional phase diﬀusion due to amplitude ﬂuctuations is expressed by the factor of ν2. In Eqs.
(1) and (2), ∆f0 is the damping at thermal equilibrium ex- pressed in linewidth, kBT is the thermal energy, and Eosci is the average magnetization oscillating energy of a cer- tain oscillation mode.
The energy Eosci becomes large as the bias current I increases.
Since the voltage oscilla- tion signal from STO originates in the MR eﬀect, Eosci is proportional to a ‘normalized’ power P/I2, where P is the power of voltage oscillation signal from STO. There- fore, Eqs.
(1) and (2) both indicate that the linewidth is proportional to the inverse normalized power in the two asymptotic regions, i.e., ∆f <,> ∝(P/I2)−1.
Ac- cordingly, drawing a linewidth versus inverse normalized power plot, we can extract ν from the following relation; s>/s< = (1 + ν2)/2, (3) where s< and s> are the slopes of asymptotes below and above threshold, respectively.
To visualize Eq. (3), we show the linewidth and inverse power calculated nu- merically in Fig. 2.
The calculation is based on the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) corresponding to a noisy nonlinear auto-oscillator9,17.
We have used the single- Lorentzian approximation for a power spectrum.
In the approximation, the linewidth is given by the real part of the ﬁrst eigenvalue in the eigenmode expansion method for FPE (ReΛ1,1 in the notation of Ref. 9).
In Fig. 2, linewidths show asymptotic behavior (dotted lines) rep- resented by Eqs.
(1) and (2) in the region below and above threshold, and the relation between the slopes of asymptotes (Eq. (3)) holds.
Measurements are performed on MgO-based planar magnetic tunnel junction devices at room tempera- ture.
Tunnel junctions are composed of IrMn(10)/ PL/MgO(1.05)/FL, in which the free layer (FL) is a CoFeB(3) layer and the pinned layer (PL) is a CoFe(4)/ Ru(0.95)/CoFeB(4) synthetic antiferromagnet trilayer.
The junctions have been fabricated by sputter deposi- tion with annealing for one hour in a high magnetic ﬁeld 1 10 100 1000 6.5 7 7.5 8 PSD (pW/GHz) Frequency (GHz) 0.70mA 0.68mA 0.66mA 0.64mA 0.62mA 0.60mA 0.58mA 0.56mA 0.54mA 0.52mA 0.50mA 0.48mA 0.46mA 0.44mA 0.42mA 0.40mA FIG.

On the same wafer, we ﬁnd samples with vari- ous TMR ratio in the range 10-90%.
We have observed that lower TMR ratio samples tend to show narrower spectral linewidth oscillations.
This tendency in MgO- based samples is similar to that reported in Ref. 18.
We consider that the diﬀerence of TMR ratio among sam- ples may result from localized defects in the MgO barrier as speculated by the authors of Ref. 18.
In this letter, we show the results of one typical low TMR ratio sam- ple with a 200 × 120 nm2 elliptical shape.
From R-H (resistance-ﬁeld) characteristic measurements of the sam- ple for several ﬁeld angles, we ﬁnd that the resistance is 235 Ω(5.6 Ω·µm2) for parallel conﬁguration, TMR ratio is 15.6 %, and an in-plane anisotropy ﬁeld Hk is about 200 Oe.
The pinned layer magnetization is along the long axis of the ellipse without an applied ﬁeld.
Oscillation properties are measured by a spectrum an- alyzer.
We apply dc current I to the sample with an- tiparallel magnetization conﬁguration.
Positive I corre- sponds to electrons ﬂowing from the pinned layer to the free layer.
Oscillation properties vary sensitively with the ﬁeld applied in the sample plane: the magnitude H of 200-700 Oe and the angle φH of 0-90◦.
When the angle φH ≃40◦± 5◦and the magnitude H ≃500 ± 50 Oe, dis- tinct oscillation peaks are observed.
In the other applied ﬁelds, distinct peaks are not observed at any bias current (I ≤0.7 mA).
Below, we show the results for the two setups of the applied ﬁelds in which narrow linewidths of ∼10 MHz are observed: (I) H = 490 Oe and φH = 42.4◦, and (II) H = 516 Oe and φH = 39.7◦.
Power spectral density (PSD) of the voltage oscillation signal in the setup (I) is shown in Fig. 3.
The character- istic oscillation mode is observed around 7.2 GHz for the bias current I ≥0.42 mA.
This mode grows steeply as the bias current increases and exhibits narrow linewidth in the high-current region.
The PSD in the setup (II) is similar to that in the setup (I).
The dependence of the frequency, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth, and the normalized power of the mode on the bias current for the setups (I) and (II) is shown in Fig. 4.
The data are obtained by Lorentzian ﬁts to the spectral peaks of the characteristic oscillation modes. The bro-3 FIG.

In (b), ∆f ≃14 MHz at 0.58 mA. In (e), ∆f ≃8.6 MHz at 0.56 mA. FIG.

ken lines in Fig. 4 denote the threshold currents Ith.
The normalized power below threshold depends on the bias current in the way that (P/I2)−1 ∝(Ith −I).8 By using the expression, we ﬁnd that Ith ≃0.46 mA for the setup (I) and Ith ≃0.44 mA for the setup (II).
In Figs. 4 (a) and (d), the frequency shift with the bias current is much smaller than that observed in previous experiments for MgO-based STOs18,19, and we cannot judge whether the shift is red or blue.
In Figs. 4 (c) and (f), the normalized power grows steeply up to the current I ≃0.52 mA from the threshold current.
For I > 0.52 mA, the normalized power is being saturated.
From the data for linewidth ∆f and normalized power P/I2 shown in Figs. 4, we have obtained the ∆f vs. (P/ I2)−1-plots shown in Figs. 5.
We have used the data for the current I ≤0.52 mA. As predicted by the the- ories, we observe that linewidth against inverse normal- ized power plots show linear behavior below and above the threshold.
The appearance of the linear behavior above the threshold supports the consideration that the variation of ν with bias current is small in the range near threshold.
By estimating the values of linear slopes s<,> and using Eq. (3), we ﬁnd the coeﬃcient |ν| ≃2.9 for the setup (I) and |ν| ≃2.6 for the setup (II).
Considering the range of values expected by the calculation as shown in Fig. 1, these values of the coeﬃcient (|ν| ∼3) are comparatively small.
The smallness is consistent with the ﬂatness of frequency (Figs. 4 (a) and (d)) and the exhibition of narrow linewidths of ∼10 MHz in the high- current region (Figs. 4 (b) and (e)).
According to Fig. 1, the coeﬃcient |ν| is expected to have small values when an in-plane ﬁeld is applied to the hard axis, i.e., φH ∼80- 90◦.
Our results measured in the angle of φH ∼40◦are inconsistent with the expectation.
We consider that the mode with 7.2 GHz peak may be a non-uniform mode and so the eﬀective directions and structures of in-plane anisotropy for the magnetization composing the mode are complicated.
Micromagnetic study to clarify the oscilla- tion mode is now in progress.
In summary, we estimated the coeﬃcient ν in MgO- based STOs which is a measure of the transformation of amplitude ﬂuctuations into phase ﬂuctuations of an oscillator.
For the device exhibiting narrow linewidth (∆f ∼10 MHz) in a high-current region, small value of the coeﬃcient (|ν| ∼3) was obtained.
