arXiv:cond-mat/0201353v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  18 Jul 2002 Fourth-order magnetic anisotropy and tunnel splittings in Mn12 from spin-orbit-vibron interactions Mark R. Pederson,a Noam Bernsteina and Jens Kortusb aCenter for Computational Materials Science, Code 6390, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375 bMPI f¨ur Festk¨operforschung, Heisenbergstr. 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany (November 3, 2018) From density-functional-theory (DFT) based methods we calculate the vibrational spectrum of the Mn12O12(COOH)16(H2O)4 molecular magnet.
Calculated infrared intensities are in accord with experimental studies.
There have been no ab initio attempts at determining which interactions account for the fourth-order anisotropy.
We show that vibrationally induced distortions of the molecule contribute to the fourth-order anisotropy Hamiltonian and that the magnitude and sign of the eﬀect (-6.2 K) is in good agreement with all experiments.
Vibrationally induced tunnel splittings in isotopically pure and natural samples are predicted.
The possibility that vibrationally induced modiﬁca- tions of the spin-orbit interaction aﬀects magnetic reori- entation barriers has not been previously investigated.
A simple model captures the physics but quantitative determination of the coupling constants requires compu- tationally demanding DFT methods.
A model Hamil- tonian for a single uniaxial anisotropic spin coupled to a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by H = γzzS2 z + 1 2(P 2 + ω2Q2) + Q P ab γ ′ abSaSb where a and b are summed over x, y, and z, and γ ′ ab = dγab dQ ).
Complet- ing the square shows the diagonal energy of a harmonic oscillator (|φ⟩) and spin (|SM⟩) product state as a func- tion of the magnetic quantum number (M) is given by: E = ω/2 + γzzM 2 −(A + BM 2)2/2ω2 (1) with A = S(S + 1)(γ ′ xx + γ ′ yy)/2 and B = γ ′ zz −(γ ′ xx + γ ′ yy)/2.
For this simple case, the interaction between vibrational and spin degrees of freedom always acts to further stabilize each M state but the energy splitting between the |M| = S and M = 0 states may be ei- ther enhanced or reduced depending on the derivatives of the γ matrix.
A more detailed analysis of this Hamil- tonian, given below, shows that it can also connect M and M ± 4 levels.
Further, in a real system, the fre- quency, ω, depends on nuclear masses so isotope eﬀects can lead to small changes in the barrier or, as discussed below, larger tunnel splittings in the anisotropy Hamil- tonian.
Both the intrinsic 4th-order and isotope eﬀects can mediate resonant tunneling of magnetization which is of great interest from the standpoint of quantum me- chanics at the mesoscale.
[1–6] In addition, the magni- tudes of terms in the anisotropy Hamiltonian determine the suitability of nanoscale particles for use in magnetic memory and quantum-computing applications.
[7,8] In general, purely electronic contributions to higher-order magnetic anisotropy scale as [1/(2c2)]4 (c = speed of light) but the spin-orbit-vibron contribution scales as [1/ω2] × [1/(2c2)]4.
The large 1/ω2 prefactor suggests this term could be dominant in high-symmetry bulk sys- tems where second-order eﬀects vanish by symmetry.
Recent experiments on Mn12O12(COOR)16(H2O)2 molecular nanomagnets, commonly referred to as Mn12- Ac, [1–6,9] provide an ideal system for understanding how vibrational degrees of freedom may enhance the mag- netic barriers.
Many researchers have noted that the tun- neling dynamics may be mediated by conventional spin- phonon interactions.
[10] Further, recent experiments by Sushkov et al. [9] show some strong variation in infrared (IR) spectra as a function of applied ﬁeld suggesting a coupling between the spin and vibrational degrees of freedom.
Accurate experiments have determined that this easy-axis uniaxial molecular magnet has a second- order anisotropy parameter of D = −0.56 K and that the fourth-order contributions to the anisotropy Hamil- tonian increase the barrier from 56 K to approximately 65 K. [3,5,6] Pederson and Khanna have combined DFT, spin-orbit coupling and second-order perturbation the- ory to calculate the second-order parameter (D) and ﬁnd D=-0.557 K in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.
[11] An estimate of the entirely electronic spin-orbit-induced fourth-order anisotropy may be ob- tained by comparing the barrier computed with spin- orbit treated within second-order perturbation theory to that computed using exact diagonalization.
Within this approach we ﬁnd a fourth-order contribution to the bar- rier on the order of 1 K and that it acts to reduce rather than to enhance the barrier.
To determine if vibrational coupling is an important contribution to magnetic anisotropies in Mn12-Ac we have performed accurate DFT based calculations on a single molecular unit.
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized-gradient approximation has been used for all calculations.
[12] Using the methods discussed in Ref.
[13], the vibrational frequencies, vibrational eigen- vectors, and IR and Raman spectra have been calculated.
Because this requires a large number (163) of unsym- 1metrized molecular calculations we have used a Troullier- Martins type [14,15] pseudopotential for the O and C atoms and have treated the H and Mn atoms within an all-electron method.
Gaussian basis sets have been fully optimized for each atom using the methods of Ref. [16].
To determine the anisotropy Hamiltonian and the deriva- tives with respect to each normal mode, we calculate the anisotropy Hamiltonian H = P ab γabSaSb for each of the 163 inequivalent vibrational displacements using the method of Ref.
[11] The coeﬃcients γxy for an arbitrary conﬁguration of atoms are determined from matrix ele- ments of the spin-orbit-coupling operator sandwiched be- tween all pairs of occupied and unoccupied Kohn-Sham wavefunctions (squared) and appropriate energy diﬀer- ence denominators.
The wavefunctions and thus the anisotropy Hamiltonian depend on the geometry of the molecule.
Derivatives of the anisotropy matrix with re- spect to the jth normal mode (i.e. dγab dQj ) may be deter- mined using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approach.
We have ascer- tained that the partial-pseudopotential-based anisotropy Hamiltonian for the equilibrium geometry reproduces the all-electron anisotropy Hamiltonian of Ref. [11].
To test the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies we compare our calculated IR spectra, plotted in Fig. 1, directly to experimental measurements of Sushkov et al. [9] The experiments measure the IR absorption of Mn12 crystals suspended in paraﬃn pellets at wavenumbers ranging from 30 cm−1 to 70 cm−1 and from 140 cm−1 to 650 cm−1.
The experimental absorption peak at 38 cm−1 has a clear corresponding feature in our cal- culations at 63 cm−1.
The structure in the 140 cm−1 to 300 cm−1 range is well reproduced by the calcu- lations: The small experimental peaks at 150 cm−1, 170 cm−1, and 200 cm−1 correspond to simulated fea- tures at 144 cm−1, 170 cm−1, and 201 cm−1, respec- tively, and the relative intensities are moderately well re- produced.
The small peak in the simulation at 180 cm−1 can be tentatively identiﬁed in the experiment as a small peak at 185 cm−1.
The structure between 215 cm−1 and 235 cm−1 in the experiment, consisting of a large peak, a small peak, and a large peak with a shoulder at high frequency, has a clear analogue in the simulation results between 230 cm−1 and 260 cm−1 with similar relative in- tensities.
The intense peak at 255 cm−1 corresponds to the simulation peak at 275 cm−1, with the smaller exper- imental peak at 270 cm−1 appearing in the simulation as a shoulder at 260 cm−1.
The double peaked structure ob- served in experiment at 284 cm−1, which has signiﬁcant activity in a magnetic ﬁeld, corresponds to the simulated peaks at 302 cm−1, 313 cm−1 and 316 cm−1.
The fol- lowing experimental triplet, consisting of a large peak at 300 cm−1 followed by two small peaks at 320 cm−1 and 340 cm−1, is present in the simulation, although at the resolution of the graph in Fig. 1 the two peaks at 326 cm−1 and 329 cm−1 overlap, and the third peak ap- pears at 343 cm−1.
The small peak at 360 cm−1 and in- tense peak at 375 cm−1 are reproduced in the simulation with opposite relative intensities (or interchanged fre- quency order) in the double peaked structure at 360 cm−1 to 368 cm−1.
The intense peak at 410 cm−1 bracketed by two smaller peaks at 395 cm−1 and 415 cm−1 appears in the simulation between 412 cm−1 and 439 cm−1.
The two small peaks in the calculated IR spectrum at 385 cm−1 and 395 cm−1 are not clearly visible in the experimen- tal data, although they could correspond to the small feature at 382 cm−1 to 390 cm−1 in the gap between the prominent double peak and triple peak structures.
In the highest frequency range measured by experiment agreement with the simulation is still good, although the relative intensities of the peaks are less accurately repro- duced.
The two faint experimental peaks at 465 cm−1 and 495 cm−1 probably correspond to the two relatively prominent peaks at 460 cm−1 and 476 cm−1.
The ﬁve peaks between 510 cm−1 and 570 cm−1 correspond to the ﬁve peaks between 500 cm−1 and 545 cm−1.
Although the intensities relative to the previous two peaks are lower in the simulation, opposite to experiment, the relative intensities within the ﬁve peak structure are good.
In both the experiment and simulation the second and ﬁfth peaks are most prominent.
The intense double peak at 605 cm−1 to 610 cm−1 clearly corresponds to the sim- ulated double peak at 564 cm−1 to 571 cm−1.
There is no comparably intense feature in the simulation that cor- responds to the highest frequency experimental peak at 640 cm−1, although several less intense peaks are present in the correct frequency range.
The decomposition into contributions from diﬀerent structural elements in the Mn12 molecule shows some general trends as a function of frequency, but no sharp variation from mode to mode.
Below 500 cm−1, the main contributions are from the Mn and formic acid.
The water molecules contribute mainly for modes below about 350 cm−1, while the anionic oxygen atoms con- tribute mainly above this frequency.
Above 500 cm−1 the Mn contribution grows relative to the formic acid contri- bution, with particularly large Mn and anionic oxygen weights in the 564 cm−1 to 571 cm−1 double peak.
We now discuss our calculations on the vibrational contributions to fourth-order anisotropy.
The coupled spin/vibron Hamiltonian is given by: H = X ab γabSaSb (2) + X j 1 2 " P 2 j + ω2 j   Q2 j + 2 ω2 j X ab dγab dQj QjSaSb !# .
The above expression may be analyzed either classically or quantum-mechanically to determine how vibrational coupling aﬀects the magnetization barrier.
As demon- strated below the magnetization barrier is enhanced by 2approximately 5.6 K classically and 6.2 K quantum me- chanically since the quantum mechanical expection value of S2 is 10 % larger than the classical value for S=10.
However, to address questions related to isotopic eﬀects and changes in tunnel barriers a quantum mechanical analysis is required.
The simplest level of approximation is to take a prod- uct wavefunction of the form |Ψ⟩= Πj |φj⟩|SM⟩, with |φj⟩a harmonic oscillator wavefunction and |SM⟩a spin- wavefunction, and determine the diagonal energy of this state.
The resulting energy E(M) = ⟨SM| H |SM⟩] is given by: E(M) = X ab γabU ab(M) + X j 1 2ωj (3) − X abcd ΓabcdU ab(M)U cd(M) with Γaba′b′ = P j 1 2ω2 j dγab dQj dγa′b′ dQj .
and Uab = ⟨SM| SaSb |SM⟩] The 4th-order barrier enhancement may then be estimated by evaluating the second line of Eq. (3) for the M = ±10 and M = 0 states and taking the diﬀerence.
This energy diﬀerence is 6.2 K. To compare directly to the experimental parametriza- tion of Barra et al. which uses 4th-order Stevens op- erators, it is instructive to expand both our calculated and their ﬁtted 4th-order expression in terms of orthog- onal cubic polynomials of degree 4.
Because of the S4 symmetry of the molecule, it is generally possible to write the fourth-order energy according to: E4 = A4 o+(A1(4)[S2(S2 z−S2/3)]+A2(4)[3S4+35S4 z−30S2S2 z]+ B1(4)[S4 x + S4 y −6S2 xS2 y] + B2(4)[SxSy(S2 x −S2 y)])/104.
In Table I, we compare the values of the expansion coeﬃ- cients for each representation.
The O2 4 Stevens operator can be expanded into Legendre polynomials of degree 2 and 4 respectively.
An interesting feature, present in both the experimen- tal and theoretical expansions, is that for the most part, the 4th order terms exhibits nearly the same angular variation as the second-order Hamiltonian.
For exam- ple the entirely diagonal 4th order S2(S2 z −S2/3) term accounts for almost all of the barrier enhancement.
This feature is very important from the standpoint of sharp tunneling transitions.
It ensures that magnetic-ﬁeld in- duced alignment condition aligns multiple pairs of states simultaneously which opens multiple tunneling paths.
The coeﬃcient A2(4) changes the diagonal energies by A2(4) × M 4/104 and is partially responsible for a broad- ening of the magnetic-ﬁeld alignment condition but does not cause any tunnel splittings at zero-ﬁeld.
The B1(4) coeﬃcient corresponds to the B4 4 Stephenson coeﬃcient, and leads to observable tunnel splittings in the M = ±2 manifold and smaller tunnel splittings in the M = ±4 manifold.

manifolds of approximately 10−2, 7×10−6 and 6×10−10 K respectively but do not split the odd M states since coupling is between M and M±4.
By randomly changing a single atomic mass by 1 amu, we ﬁnd that the odd-M states are split with a tunnel splitting of the M = ±1 states on the order of 10−4 K. The isotopic eﬀects exper- imentally observed by Wernsdorfer et al. [17] in Fe8 may be partially due to the mass eﬀects identiﬁed here.
In Fig. 2 we show the barrier as a function of the num- ber of vibrational modes that are included.
When none of the vibrational modes are included the barrier reproduces the earlier calculation of Ref. [11].
As expected qualita- tively, most (85 %) of the fourth-order barrier is asso- ciated with the frequencies in the 100–500 cm−1 range that correlates with Mn vibrations.
The upper panel of the ﬁgure shows that there are a 5–10 modes which ac- count for about 80–90 % of the fourth-order anisotropy barrier.
For example, single modes at 189, 270, 280, and 465 and 1496 cm−1 contribute 0.8 K, 1.6 K, 0.8 K, 0.25 K and 0.45 K respectively to the 4th-order barrier.
These modes and all other modes that contribute visible spikes in Fig. 2 share one simple trait.
They are optically silent to IR absorption and transmission but show strong Raman intensity.
The calculated Raman intensities for these modes are shown in Table II.
Recently, Sushkov et al. [9] have performed experi- ments on Mn12-Ac and have shown that the IR trans- mittances at 284, 306 and 409 cm−1 exhibit strong de- pendencies when magnetic ﬁelds are applied to the crys- tal and that the dependence is particularly strong for the mode at 284 cm−1.
This suggests that vibrations in this energy range are associated with the spin carrying Mn ions as conﬁrmed from the projected DOS in Fig. 1.

Fourth-order anisotropy Hamiltonian as deter- mined from experiment, DFT plus vibration-spin coupling, and DFT without this coupling.

To determine possible eﬀects of methyl termination of the carboxyl groups, we have changed the mass of the H on the formate groups from 1 to 15 (the mass of a CH3).
This further increases the 4th-order anisotropy from 6.2 K to 7.3 K and leads to even better agree- ment with experiment.
There could also be terms due to d2γ/dQ2.
However, such interactions eﬀectively change the vibrational spring constant and scale as µ2 Mωc4 rather than µ4 ω2c8 where µ is the total magnetic moment.
Be- cause of the large masses involved (even for hydrogen) an order of magnitude estimate suggests that the total bar- rier would change by less than 0.01 K from this type of ef- fect.
Further, in contrast to terms discussed above, these contributions add as amplitudes and could partially can- cel one another.
The spring-constant terms directly mod- ify the 2nd-order γ matrix allowing for isotopic induced symmetry breaking.
While potentially unimportant from the standpoint of barrier formation, this eﬀect leads to a type of locally varying second-order transverse anisotropy required to explain experiments (See Ref.
[18].) We are in the process of studying this and other possibilities.
To summarize, we have performed accurate DFT- based calculations on the Mn12-Ac molecule to deter- mine whether vibron-spin coupling could be responsible for part of the 4th-order anisotropy Hamiltonian.
Our re- sults suggest that vibron-spin coupling accounts for most of the eﬀect and that it is signiﬁcantly larger and a diﬀer- ent sign than the O(1/c8) terms that arise from an exact diagonalization treatment of spin-orbit coupling.
