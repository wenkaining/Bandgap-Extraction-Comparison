An experimental and theoretical study of Ni impurity centers in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 I. A. Sluchinskaya∗and A. I. Lebedev Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia (Dated: November 5, 2018) The local environment and the charge state of a nickel impurity in cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 are studied by XAFS spectroscopy.
According to the XANES data, the mean Ni charge state is ∼2.5+.
An analysis of the EXAFS spectra and their comparison with the results of ﬁrst-principle calculations of the defect geometry suggest that Ni2+ ions are in a high-spin state at the B sites of the perovskite structure and the diﬀerence of the Ni2+ and Ti4+ charges is mainly compensated by distant oxygen vacancies.
In addition, a considerable amount of nickel in the sample is in a second phase BaNiO3−δ.
The measurements of the lattice parameter show a decrease in the unit cell volume upon doping, which can indicate the existence of a small amount of Ni4+ ions at the B sites.

In particular, the idea of practical application of the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect con- sisting in the appearance of a photocurrent or very high photovoltages upon illumination of homogeneous crystals without an inversion center (including ferroelectrics)1 has been discussed since 1970s.2 However, since the quantum yield of this eﬀect was low, the idea was not used in prac- tice.
In recent years, the interest to ferroelectric oxides was revitalized due to the appearance of new ideas how to increase the eﬃciency of solar energy converters based on the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect.3,4 The main disadvantage of ferroelectric oxides is their comparatively wide energy gap (∼3 eV), as a result of which they absorb only a small part of solar radiation.
To solve this problem, it has long been proposed to dope the oxides with 3d elements5 that in some cases can result in the formation of color centers.
Recent theoretical works showed that the substitution for Ti in PbTiO3 with an impurity having d8 electron conﬁguration (Ni, Pd, Pt) compensated by an oxygen va- cancy made it possible to decrease the energy gap of this material.6,7 The experimental studies of SrTiO3 doped with a number of 3d elements (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni)8–13 showed that the doping of SrTiO3 results in a strong ab- sorption of light in the visible region and this eﬀect is the most signiﬁcant for Co and Ni impurities.
However, since strontium titanate is not a ferroelectric, we have de- cided to study a well-known ferroelectric BaTiO3 doped with nickel, believing that its absorption spectrum can be matched to the solar radiation spectrum.
Since nickel is used for fabricating contacts to ferroelec- tric ceramics, at the ﬁrst stages of studying nickel-doped barium titanate, the main attention was focused on the determination of nickel solubility in BaTiO3, its inﬂu- ence on the Curie temperature, the dielectric constant, and other properties as well as on the inﬂuence of Ni on the transition to a nonpolar hexagonal P63/mmc phase that is stable in undoped BaTiO3 at temperatures above 1460◦C. It was shown that incorporation of Ni decreased the transition temperature to the hexagonal phase; how- ever, the nickel solubility and its concentration needed for this transition were strongly dependent on synthe- sis conditions and the available data are very contradic- tory.14–18 It was found that Ni in BaTiO3 acts as an acceptor.19 The doping of barium titanate with nickel decreased the dielectric constant and the Curie temper- ature and also resulted in a smearing of the ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO3 as the Ni concentration in- creased.20–22 The kinetics of the transformation between the cubic and hexagonal phases in BaTiO3 doped with various impurities was studied in Ref. 14.
It was shown that nickel favors the transition to the hexagonal phase, while the doping of BaTiO3 with strontium prevents this transition.
In Ref. 15, it was noted that BaTiO3 doped with nickel changes its color to dark-brown.
Information on the charge state and the structural po- sition of Ni in BaTiO3 was mainly obtained from the EPR data and is also very contradictory.
The lines observed in the EPR spectra were ascribed either to Ni+ ions at the B sites23 or to oﬀ-center Ni+ ions at the A sites.24 In the EPR studies of nickel-doped hexagonal BaTiO3,18 Ni3+ ions substituting for Ti4+ ions in two diﬀerent positions (Ti(1) and Ti(2)) were found.
However, the concentra- tion of these centers was less than 5% of the nominal amount of nickel; i.e., most of the Ni ions in the sample were in the EPR-inactive state. In Refs.
25 and 26 we studied the charge state of Ni in BaxSr1−xTiO3 by XAFS (X-ray absorption ﬁne struc- ture) spectroscopy and showed that it changed from 4 to 2.5 as the barium content was increased.
The ﬁrst- principle calculations explained this result by diﬀerent energies of the oxygen vacancy formation in SrTiO3 and BaTiO3.
The calculations of the electronic structure of nickel-doped samples revealed the formation of an impu- rity band in the forbidden gap of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 and explained the origin of the strong impurity absorption.

17 and 27, the appearance of the ferromag- netism in BaTiO3(Ni) ceramic samples at 300 K was ob- served and explained by the existence of oxygen vacan- cies17 or the appearance of metallic nickel precipitates in the ceramics reduced in an Ar+H2 atmosphere.27 In ad- dition, of interest are the studies of BaTiO3/Ni compos- ites which exhibited interesting multiferroic properties, in particular, the possibility of the magnetization reversal by electric ﬁeld,28 and also the works on development of a heterophase material with a very high dielectric constant near the percolation threshold.29,30 From the literature review it follows that BaTiO3(Ni) is indeed a promising material that can provide an ef- fective solar radiation absorption.
Because of this, the purpose of this work is to study the BaTiO3(Ni) samples synthesized in various conditions using X-ray diﬀraction and other structural methods.
Since the doping impu- rity can enter A and B sites of the perovskite structure and exist in them in diﬀerent charge states,8 we use the XAFS spectroscopy to determine the structural position, the local environment, and the charge state of impurities in BaTiO3. II.
SAMPLES, EXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATION TECHNIQUES Since the structure of BaTiO3 can be transformed from the cubic to the hexagonal as a result of doping with nickel, and the addition of strontium prevents this tran- sition,14 20% SrTiO3 was added to BaTiO3 to retain its cubic structure.
The Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 samples doped with 3% Ni were prepared by solid-phase synthesis.
The starting com- ponents were BaCO3, SrCO3, nanocrystalline TiO2 ob- tained by hydrolysis of tetrapropylorthotitanate and dried at 500◦C, and Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O.
The com- ponents were weighted in required proportions, ground in acetone, and calcined in air in alumina crucibles at 1100◦C for 4–8 h.
The prepared powders were ground again and annealed in air at 1500◦C for 2 h. Then, a part of the samples was additionally annealed at 1100◦C for 8 h, but, as was shown by the measurements, this did not change their properties (the experiment was performed to verify whether the nickel charge state would change as the annealing temperature is changed).
To incorporate the impurities into the B site, the sample composition was intentionally deviated from stoichiometry to excess Ba.
The synthesis of the NiTiO3 and BaNiO3−δ refer- ence compounds was described in Refs. 12 and 13.
The phase composition was checked by X-ray phase analysis.
The X-ray absorption spectra were measured in the re- gions of the extended ﬁne structure (EXAFS) and near- edge structure (XANES) on the KMC-2 station of the BESSY synchrotron radiation source (the electron energy was 1.7 GeV and the maximum current was 290 mA) at the Ni K-edge (8333 eV) at 300 K. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si1−xGex(111) double-crystal monochromator.
The EXAFS spectra were recorded in ﬂuorescence mode.
The intensity I0 of the radiation inci- dent on a sample was measured using an ionization cham- ber, and the intensity of the ﬂuorescence radiation If was measured using a R¨ONTEC X-ﬂash silicon energy- dispersive detector with an operating area of 10 mm2.
The EXAFS spectra were analyzed using the widely used IFEFFIT program package.31 An oscillating EXAFS function χ(k) was extracted from the ﬂuorescence ex- citation spectra µ(E) = If/I0 (where E is the X-ray quantum energy) using the ATHENA program.
Then, by minimizing the root-mean-square deviation of the ex- perimental k2χ(k) curve from the curve calculated for a given model of the local environment of the impurity atom using the ARTEMIS program, the distances Rj and the Debye–Waller factor σ2 j for the jth shell were cal- culated.
Simultaneously, the energy origin correction dE0 was also varied.
The coordination numbers were taken to be constant and were given by the structural model.
The number of the adjustable parameters (9–15) was smaller than the number of independent data points Nind = 2∆k∆R/π ≈20.
The dependences of the scatter- ing amplitude and phase, the phase shift of the central atom, and the photoelectron free path on the photoelec- tron wave vector k for all single- and multiple-scattering paths required to build theoretical curves χ(k) were cal- culated using the FEFF6 program.32 An important fea- ture of the ARTEMIS program is the possibility of ﬁtting of the EXAFS spectra to a sum of several independent contributions.
An important feature of this work is that the pure geometric approach characteristic of standard EXAFS data analysis is complemented with the calculations of the geometry and the electronic structure of impurity complexes, which enables us to estimate the physical fea- sibility of diﬀerent structural models, and so to increase the reliability of the results.
The geometry and the electronic structure of nickel- doped BaTiO3 were modeled from ﬁrst principles within the density functional theory using the ABINIT software package.
The calculations were performed on 40-atom (simple cubic) and 80-atom (fcc) supercells in which one of the Ti atoms was replaced by a Ni atom (the Ni con- centrations were 12.5 and 6.25%, respectively).
Since the nickel atom has a partially ﬁlled d shell, we per- formed the calculations using PAW pseudopotentials33 and the LDA+U approximation.34 Parameters U = 5 eV and J = 0.9 eV that describe the Coulomb and the ex- change interactions inside the d shell were taken from the literature as typical values of these parameters for Ni.
It was shown that a variation of these parameters within 20% did not substantially inﬂuence the results.
The cut- oﬀenergy was 30 Ha (816 eV); the integration over the Brillouin zone was performed on a 4×4×4 Monkhorst– Pack mesh for the simple cubic supercell or the mesh with equivalent k-point density for the fcc supercell.
The relaxation of the lattice parameters and the atomic posi- tions in the supercells was stopped when the Hellmann–3 FIG.

Feynman forces became less than 10−5 Ha/Bohr (0.5 meV/˚A).
The modeling on 40-atom and 80-atom supercells with- out oxygen vacancies gives the results for the Ni4+ charge state of the impurity.
In order to change the charge state to Ni2+, either a vacancy was introduced into the sys- tem or we used a trick35 in which two extra electrons were added to the system.
Although, in the latter case, the system was not electrically neutral, the tests showed that the addition of two electrons to the 80-atom super- cell of barium titanate results in a small increase in the energy gap width (0.12 eV) and in the lattice parameter (0.61%).
However, the obtained density of states and the Ni–O interatomic distances in doped samples were close to those calculated for a model in which the Ni2+ charge state was obtained by adding a distant oxygen vacancy located at distance of 5.8 ˚A from the Ni atom. III.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A. X-Ray diﬀraction measurements Fig. 1 shows a typical X-ray diﬀraction pattern of the samples under study.
The Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 samples doped with 3% Ni have the perovskite-type cubic structure with the lattice parameter 3.9723 ± 0.0013 ˚A at 300 K and were almost single-phase.
Small traces of a second phase in the angular range 2θ = 20–30◦belong to the Ba2TiO4 compound that often appears in ceramic barium titanate.
Comparing the obtained lattice parameter with the lat- tice parameter of undoped Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 solid solution (a = 3.978 ˚A) shows a slight compression of the lattice which indicates that the impurity incorporated into the sample.
The above lattice parameter for the undoped solid solution was obtained by an extrapolation of the data of Ref.
36 from the cubic phase to the region, in which the solid solution became tetragonal as a result of FIG.

the ferroelectric phase transition.
The incorporation of nickel to the solid solution decreased the Curie tempera- ture in our samples below 300 K. B. Analysis of the XANES spectra To determine the charge state of the Ni impurity in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3, we compared the position of the absorp- tion edge in the XANES spectra of the samples under study with the positions of the edges in the BaNiO3−δ and NiTiO3 reference compounds (Fig. 2).
It is seen that the absorption edge in the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sample is shifted by 0.7 eV from the absorption edge in NiTiO3, where the nickel charge state is 2+, to the ab- sorption edge in the BaNiO3−δ reference compound in which the nickel charge state is 3.4+ (the nickel charge state in this sample was determined in Refs. 12 and 13).
From the obtained absorption edge shift (see the discus- sion in Refs.
25 and 26) it was concluded that the mean charge state of Ni in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sample is ∼2.5+.
This implies that the most part of the Ni ions in the samples is in charge state 2+ and only small part of them is in charge states 3+ or 4+.
Our conclusion agrees with the results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study17 in which the main charge state of Ni in BaTiO3 was 2+.
C. Analysis of the EXAFS spectra To determine the structural position and the local environment of the Ni impurity in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3, the EXAFS spectra were analyzed.
The models of impurity centers were constructed taking into account the charge state of the impurity obtained from the XANES spec- tra.
First, we analyzed the models in which the impu- rity atom entered either A or B sites of the perovskite4 TABLE I. Local structure of the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sam- ple (data analysis within a single model).
Adjustable Site A Ni2+ B –VO Ni2+ B –VO parameter (distant vacancy) (nearest vacancy) R factor 0.408 0.0741 0.0537 S2 0 0.896 0.774 0.889 RNi−O(I) (˚A) 2.086 2.080 2.070 RNi−O(II) (˚A) 3.120, 3.678 — 1.873 RNi−Ba (˚A) 2.752 3.436 3.383–3.499 RNi−Ti (˚A) 2.974 3.918 3.786–3.986 structure with a diﬀerent local environment.
A criterion of agreement between the experimental and calculated spectra was a small value of the R factor that quantita- tively describes the discrepancy of the compared curves, the closeness of the value of the S2 0 parameter to the value obtained from the analysis of the EXAFS spectra of the reference compounds, and a visual agreement of the Fourier-transforms of the spectra in the R represen- tation.
The EXAFS data analysis of the NiO, NiTiO3, and metallic Ni reference compounds enabled us to determine the S2 0 value, which was equal to 0.92 for NiTiO3, 0.97 for NiO, and 0.77 for Ni.
An analysis of a model in which the Ni2+ ion enters the A site both in the on-center and oﬀ-center positions showed that the calculated spectrum on no account can describe well the experimental spectrum (the least value of the R factor was 0.408).
For an impurity atom at the B site (Ni2+ substitutes for Ti4+), the sample must contain vacancies to provide the electrical neutrality.
Thus, we considered two models: the model with an oxygen vacancy VO located in the ﬁrst shell of the Ni atom (in this case, the shift of the Ni atom from the site was allowed to be up to 0.5 ˚A in the direction of the vacancy) and the model with a distant oxygen vacancy and the on-center position of the impurity.
A reasonable agreement between the experimental and calculated spectra was obtained in two cases, in which (1) Ni2+ atom substitutes for the Ti4+ atom and there is a distant oxygen vacancy VO and (2) Ni2+ atom substi- tutes for the Ti4+ atom and is displaced from the B site toward the vacancy VO located in the ﬁrst shell.
Table I gives the interatomic distances to the nearest shells and the values of the R factor obtained for these models.
It is seen that in the model with a distant vacancy, the Ni–O distances are close to the sum of the ionic radii of the O2−and Ni2+ ions (RNi2+ = 0.69 ˚A, RO2−= 1.4 ˚A), so that the XANES and EXAFS data agree well.
However, the S2 0 parameter in this model is underestimated.
As for the second model, unfortunately, we did not get a single- valued solution.
In addition to the solution reported in Refs.
25 and 26, we found two more possible solutions: one, in which the Ni atom is displaced by 0.1 ˚A toward the vacancy, and the other, in which the Ni atom is dis- placed in the opposite direction.
Table I gives the data for the latter solution which had the lowest R factor.
The appearance of several solutions with close RNi−O(I) dis- tances to four atoms and substantially diﬀerent RNi−O(II) distances to the ﬁfth atom (2.438, 2.178, and 1.873 ˚A) is related to the fact that the contribution of a single O(II) atom to the EXAFS function is small, and the nonlinear regression problem can ﬁnd one of numerous solutions corresponding to a local, not global, minimum. IV.
RESULTS OF FIRST-PRINCIPLE CALCULATIONS The analysis of the experimental data in Sec.
III C enabled us to propose several structural models that reasonably describe the experimental EXAFS spectrum.
To choose the most adequate model, we used the ﬁrst- principle calculations to model the geometry of a number of impurity complexes containing nickel.
In the model- ing, particular attention was paid to conﬁgurations in which nickel had the charge state 2+, which is closest to that obtained in the experiment.
Although we have not obtained evidences that the nickel atoms enter the A sites of the perovskite structure, we considered this case, too.
The calculations showed that the on-center position of the Ni2+ ion at the A site is unstable.
The modeling for an oﬀ-center Ni2+ ion at the A site showed that this impurity center is diamagnetic and is characterized by nearly square planar conﬁgura- tion (the shift of Ni from the plane of four oxygen atoms is 0.195 ˚A) and short Ni–O distances (1.867 ˚A) that do not agree with the experiment.
In the case when a Ni atom enter the B site, the sim- plest case is that in which the nickel charge state co- incides with the titanium one (4+).
In this case, the electrical neutrality is not violated upon doping, and the defect can be considered as a point defect.
The calcu- lations of the geometry of the 80-atom supercell showed that, as a result of relaxation, the distances to the oxy- gen atoms in the ﬁrst shell are 1.922 ˚A.
The ion is in the diamagnetic state (S = 0).
The comparison of the cal- culated distances with those obtained from the EXAFS data analysis shows their marked diﬀerence.
So, the ge- ometry of this defect does not agree with that observed in the experiment.
Actually, the local environment of nickel in barium ti- tanate is more complicated, since the impurity charge (2+) found in our experiment suggests that the structure should contain an oxygen vacancy that compensates the diﬀerence of the charges of the Ni2+ and Ti4+ ions.
In our calculations, we ﬁrst assumed that a vacancy in the formed Ni2+–VO complex is located in the ﬁrst shell (this structure completely corresponds to the model con- sidered in Ref. 7).
The calculations of the equilibrium conﬁguration of this complex performed on a 80-atom su- percell showed that the Ni ion is shifted by only 0.021 ˚A5 TABLE II.

The dis- tance to four nearest O atoms in the plane is 1.925 ˚A and the distance to the ﬁfth oxygen atom is 2.192 ˚A.
The im- purity complex is diamagnetic (S = 0).
A comparison of the calculated interatomic distances with those obtained from the EXAFS data analysis shows that this model also does not agree with the experiment.
Prior to further discussion, we should make an impor- tant remark.
In all aforementioned models, the distances to the nearest oxygen atoms were close to each other and were slightly dependent on the ion charge.
This put us on the idea to perform additional calculations for a number of compounds of two-, tri-, and tetravalent nickel (NiO, NiTiO3, NiNb2O6, BaNiO2, BaNiO3, LiNiO2, SrNiO3, and PbNiO3).
The calculation showed that a “long” dis- tance (1.97–2.04 ˚A) is obtained only when the nickel atom is paramagnetic (S = 1) (Table II).
As follows from Ta- ble II, the interatomic Ni–O distance is determined pri- marily by the spin state of the Ni atom rather than by its charge, and so we ﬁrst should focus our attention on the paramagnetic centers to explain the geometry of an impurity Ni center in BaTiO3.
It turned out that the complexes of the Ni2+ ion with the oxygen vacancy located in the fourth or more distant shell of the Ni atom (“a distant vacancy”) are such cen- ters.
We considered three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the complexes.
In the ﬁrst of them, the vacancy was located at a distance of 1.5 lattice constants along the [001] axis; in the second of them, the vacancy was additionally dis- placed sideways.
In the third conﬁguration, two extra electrons were added to the system (these electrons can be supplied by either oxygen vacancies or donor impu- rity atoms).
The relaxation of the positions of all atoms in these models showed that the mean Ni–O distances in them are 2.038–2.082 ˚A, in better agreement with the experiment.
V. DISCUSSION As follows from Sec.
IV, the interatomic Ni–O distance is determined by the magnetic state of the Ni ion to a greater extent than by its charge state (Table II).
In ad- dition, it was shown that the Ni2+–VO complex with the nearest vacancy considered in Ref. 7 is diamagnetic and is characterized by a set of distances that strongly dif- fer from those obtained from the EXAFS data analysis.
The Ni–O distance that was observed in the experiment, in our opinion, can be explained by Ni2+ paramagnetic complexes with distant vacancies.
However, the analysis performed in Sec.
III C showed that in this case we are dealing with an underestimated value of S2 0 (Table I).
To solve this problem, we considered a number of new structural models.
First, we assumed that a part of the Ni atoms in Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 is in a higher charge state, which follows from the analysis of the XANES spectra (Sec. III B).
We considered a model, in which the nickel atom is at the B site in two charge states simultane- ously.
We took into account a possible diﬀerence in the distances to the nearest oxygen atoms and the diﬀerence in the absorption edge energies of the atoms in diﬀerent charge states.
A similar situation can be also observed in a model in which the Ni atoms have the same charge state but diﬀerent magnetic states (S = 0 and 1); such a situation is possible, for example, when the Ni2+ ions form the complexes with the neighboring and distant va- cancies simultaneously.
The diﬀerence of this model from the previous one is only in that the absorption edge en- ergies are considered to be the same in the latter case.
The results obtained from the analysis of these models are given in Table III.
Although these models describe the experimental k2χ(k) curve quite reasonably, we again encounter an underestimated value of S2 0.
Lastly, the last group of the models were the mod- els that admit the existence of the second phase precip- itates in the samples.
The ﬁrst of them was a model in which the cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) phase and micro- precipitates of the hexagonal BaTiO3(Ni) phase coexist.
Both variants of incorporation of nickel into the hexago- nal phase (Ni at the Ti(1) and Ti(2) sites) were analyzed.
Although these models gave a reasonable agreement for a sum of S2 0 parameters of both the phases, the values of the R factor characterizing the agreement between the curves were not quite low.
The parameters for the model with nickel at site Ti(1) are given in Table III.
Then we analyzed the models in which the samples were supposed to contain microinclusions which could ap- pear at the grain boundaries in our ceramic powders and which are hardly detected using X-ray diﬀraction (X-ray amorphous phase).
We considered the variants of inclu- sions of NiTiO3, NiO, metallic Ni, and the BaNiO3−δ compound.
An analysis of the EXAFS spectra showed that the variants with inclusions of NiTiO3, NiO, and metallic Ni very insigniﬁcantly improved the agreement between the calculated and experimental EXAFS spectra since the fraction of the second phase was from 0.001 to6 TABLE III.

0.017, i.e., it was close to zero (the parameters describing the local structure of the second phase were taken from the EXAFS data analysis of pure individual phases).
In these models the R factor was about 0.066.
The best agreement between the calculated and exper- imental spectra was obtained for a model in which the second phase is BaNiO3−δ.
For this model, the R factor decreased by more than one order of magnitude as com- pared to that for the models considered above (Table III).
Fig. 3 shows a typical EXAFS spectrum k2χ(k) for Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) and its Fourier transform F(R), which are compared to the results of calculations within this model.
Unfortunately, a strongly defective structure of BaNiO3−δ, whose composition (0 ≤δ ≤1) depends on the temperature and partial oxygen pressure during its synthesis, made it impossible to use the experimen- tal EXAFS spectra in the analysis.
Because of this, the structure of BaNiO3−δ was modeled from ﬁrst principles using the structural model of BaNiO3.
The results of the ﬁtting are given in Table III.
The most important in this model is that the value of S2 0 ﬁnally became close to the values obtained for the reference compounds.
Tak- ing into account that the second phase is formed by an individual nickel compound and the main phase is the solid solution with a nickel concentration lower than 3%, the ratio of the volumes of these phases can be estimated as 1:50, based on the ratio of contributions of the two phases (values of S2 0).
Note that the distance of 2.438 ˚A, which was earlier attributed to the Ni– O one,12,13 actu- ally corresponds to the Ni–Ni distance in BaNiO3−δ.
Note that two pure compounds in the BaNiO3−δ sys- tem, namely BaNiO2 and BaNiO3, have similar local structures.
They consist of one-dimensional Ni–Ni chains extending along one of the axes with quite short Ni–Ni distance (about 2.4 ˚A) and two or three oxygen atoms located adjacent to this short bond.
When there are two atoms, they are arranged as planar NiO4 squares forming puckered chains; when there are three atoms, they form triangles whose centers are in the middle of the Ni–Ni bond.
When the number of oxygen atoms is intermedi- ate, as is the case of BaNiO3−δ, the atoms are located in random positions adjacent to the Ni–Ni chains.
There is no a long-range order in the arrangement of these atoms, and they are highly disordered.
This explains very high values of the Debye–Waller factors for the oxygen atoms in the second phase and a practical impossibility of ob- serving precipitates of this phase in X-ray diﬀraction.
To simulate the defective BaNiO3−δ phase, we chosen the BaNiO3 phase, although either of two phases under dis- cussion can be used when analyzing the EXAFS spectra.
In conclusion, we discuss the decrease in the lattice parameter observed in our samples upon their doping.
According to our measurements, the lattice parameter of the nickel-doped samples was 0.14% less than that of the undoped material.
Our calculations of the changes in the cubic lattice parameter upon doping gave the following results for the nickel concentration of 6.25%: +0.522% for the complex of Ni2+ with a distant vacancy, −0.095% for the complex of Ni2 + with the nearest vacancy, and −0.74% for Ni4 + at the B site.
It is seen that the model of the complex with a distant vacancy proposed in this work do not agree well with the X-ray diﬀraction data.
However, it should be noted that the lattice parameter also decreased in a nickel-doped SrTiO3, in which nickel entered the B site as a Ni4+ ion.
Taking into account that the mean charge state in our samples is ∼2.5+, we can suppose that a part of nickel in the samples has the charge state 4+.

EXAFS spectra of the Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3(3% Ni) sample in (a) k- and (b) R-representations: the solid lines show the experimental data, the dashed lines are the result of ﬁtting performed in the range k = 3–12.4 ˚A−1 and R = 1–4.3 ˚A. solutions with shorter Ni–O distances shows that such short distances can be in the samples (Table III).
Unfor- tunately, the ﬁtting of the EXAFS spectra with simulta- neous account of three models of the local environment is impossible because of a very large number of adjustable parameters. VI.
CONCLUSIONS The local environment and the charge state of the nickel impurity in cubic Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 have been stud- ied by XAFS spectroscopy.
The analysis of the XANES spectra showed that the mean charge state of the Ni atoms is ∼2.5+.
The analysis of the EXAFS spectra, which took into account the results of ﬁrst-principle cal- culations of the geometry of defects, suggests that Ni atoms enter the B sites of the perovskite structure, and the diﬀerence between the Ni2+ and Ti4+ charges is mainly compensated by distant oxygen vacancies.
In ad- dition, the EXAFS data analysis revealed that a con- siderable amount of nickel in the sample is in the form of the X-ray amorphous second phase BaNiO3−δ.
The measurement of the lattice parameter and its compari- son with the results of the computer modeling showed that the decrease in the unit cell volume upon doping could indicate the existence of a small amount of Ni4+ ions at the B sites in the samples.
The obtained results can be interesting for designing a new type of solar en- ergy converters that use the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect in the material studied in this work.
