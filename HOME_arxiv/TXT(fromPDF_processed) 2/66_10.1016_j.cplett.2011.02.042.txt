PACS numbers: I. INTRODUCTION Recently, mathematical analysis elucidated that 120◦ bonding forms a 3-D 10-member ring periodic structure (K4 structure) and can be regarded as the twin of the di- amond structure1.
From the view point of carbon chem- istry, 120◦bonding is of the sp2 bond type, which form a 2-D structure with a 6-member ring, and the K4 car- bon structure has not been experimentally discovered.
Because of the wide applications of carbon materials (graphite, amorphous, diamond, CNT and fullerene2), if such a new member exists in nature or can be synthe- sized, then this new material should have a very signiﬁ- cant impact.
The stability and properties of this carbon K4 structure have been studied using ﬁrst principles calculations3,4.
It is interesting to note that carbon K4 is metallic3,4, although the phonon calculation results in- dicate the structure is unstable5.
Compared with the graphite structure of sp2 bonding, the binding energy per bond is slightly lower.
This is possibly one of the reasons for the instability of the carbon K4 crystals against the thermal vibration.
It is well understood that atomic intercalation to the carbonaceous materials changes the structural stability and sometimes provides totally diﬀerent properties.
We propose that atomic intercalation will aﬀect the elec- tronic distribution in the K4 crystals and possibly sta- bilize the structure.
Over 40 years ago, disilicides such as SrSi2 were found to have K4 type ﬂame of Si6.
This result encouraged us to investigate impurity intercalated carbon K4 systems although such crystal structures are not found in the carbide system7.
This study examines the structural stability and sev- eral properties of the atomic intercalated carbon K4 crys- tals, XC2 (X=H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb or Sr) by ﬁrst principles calculations. II.
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS First principles calculations based on density func- tional theory8,9 are performed for the K4 type crystals XC2, C, Si and SrSi2 using the Vienna Ab-initio Simula- tion Package (VASP)10.
Local density approximation (LDA)11,12 is used for the exchange-correlation energy functional.
In the present calculations, all these crystals are considered as spin-un- polarized systems.
To reduce the computational costs, the projector- augmented wave method13 is used to approximate elec- trons in each atom in the crystal.
For H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb and Sr, valence electrons of 1s1, 2s1, 2s2, 2s22p1, 2s22p2, 2s22p3, 2s22p4, 2s22p5, 3s1, 3s2, 3s23p1, 3s23p2, 3s23p3, 3s23p4, 3s23p5, 3s23p64s1, 3s23p64s2, 4s24p1, 4s24p2, 4s24p3, 4s24p4, 4s24p5, 4s24p65s1 and 4s24p65s2 are considered, respectively.
To evaluate the stability of the XC2 K4 crystal struc- ture, the following procedure is adopted.
(1) The original conventional unit cell for the carbon K4 crystal is shown in Figure 1(a).
Four X atoms (X = H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb, or Sr) are allocated to reduced coordinates ( 1 8, 1 8, 1 8), ( 7 8, 5 8, 3 8), ( 3 8, 7 8, 5 8), ( 5 8, 3 8, 7 8) in the original unit cell.
The primitive unit cell of XC2 with P4332 (O6) symmetry is shown in Fig. 1(b).
The symmetric plane of the atomic intercalated system is shown in Fig. 1(c).
As shown in Fig. 1(d), three adjacent atoms (red) are aligned on a straight line with the same distance (C-X, and X-C).
(2) Binding energy versus volume curve is evalu- ated and ﬁtted using Murnaghan’s equation of state14.
For these calculations, Brillouin zone integration is performed for 8×8×8 k-point meshes generated by the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.
The residual minimiza- tion/direct inversion in the iterative subspace method is used to accelerate the convergence of self-consistent total energy calculations.
The convergence criterion is set to2 be within 1 ×10−8 eV/formula unit cell.
The cut-oﬀen- ergy for the plane-wave expansion of valence electrons for the primitive unit cell is determined, so that the number of plane waves is constant over a full range of the lattice constant.
Around the minimum of binding energy ver- sus volume curve, the cut-oﬀenergies were set to be 500 and 400 eV for C and XC2, and Si and XSi2 crystals, respectively.
(3) The unit cells obtained from step (2) are optimized with freedom of the atomic conﬁguration under the sym- metry constraint.
(4) The unit cells obtained from step (3) are optimized without any constraint on the crystal structure.
The con- vergence criterion is set to be within 1 ×10−7 eV/˚A unit cell.
(5) The frozen phonon calculations were performed us- ing the FROPHO code15 which is based on Parlinski-Li- Kawazoe method16.
To obtain the force constants for the phonon calculations, the atomic displacements are set to be 0.01 ˚A .
The Born - von Karman boundary condition is applied for each primitive unit cell obtained with multiplication after steps (3) and (4) for the phonon calculation.
In these calculations, the primitive cells are multiplied by 2 for each direction of the unit vector. III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The structure with K4 crystal ﬂame considered for C, XC2, Si and SrSi2 systems in the present study maintain K4 type crystal ﬂame composed of C or Si with distortion through the whole process of the geometry optimization.
Furthermore, the crystal symmetry is maintained within an accuracy of less than 0.001˚A .
The lattice constant (a), volume at lattice constant (V0), cohesive energy per atom (Ecoh) and bulk modulus at V0 (B0) are evaluated for the fully optimized structure.
In this study, Ecoh for XC2: Ecoh,XC2 is deﬁned as Ecoh,XC2 ≡ −EXC2 +NXatom×EXatom+NCatom/K4 ×ECatom NXatom+NCatom/K4 .
Here, EA and NA are the total energy and the number of atoms for A, respectively.
To obtain these values, Mur- naghan’s equation of state is used to ﬁt the binding en- ergy versus volume curve.
Parameters in the equation are determined using the least squares method in the range of about 0.8V0 < V < 1.2V0, where the root mean square is set to be less than 5.0 meV/atom.
The obtained values of a, V0, Ecoh, and B0 for the crystals are shown in Figure 2(a).
In XC2, the values of a and V0 generally increase with the atomic number of X. Generally, the values of a for the XC2 crystals are larger than that for carbon K4.
That is, generally the carbon K4 ﬂames are expanded by intercalating X to the carbon systems.
However, the values of V0 for X=H, Li, ..., S, are smaller than that of carbon K4 while those for X=Cl, ..., Sr are larger.
This is because of the suﬃciently wide vacant spaces in carbon K4 that is compensated by X atoms and the increase of the occupied spaces by X atoms for the increase of the atomic number of X. On the other hand, the values of Ecoh decrease with the increasing period of X. There is a strong negative correlation with a and V0 as shown in the correlation co- eﬃcients: ra−Ecoh=-0.792 and rV0−Ecoh=-0.796.
For each period of X in the XC2, Ecoh generally shows largest val- ues for intermediate elements X: IIIB or IVB.
This en- hanced energy gain can be explained by the completion of the electronic shell in C atoms composing K4 type ﬂame, the bonds formation with X in the XC2 crystals and the bonds expantion which weaken the bonds.
The Ecoh val- ues of the XC2 are not larger than that of the carbon K4.
This is apparently resulted from the relative weak- ness of the X-C bonds in the XC2 crystals compared with the C-C bonds in the carbon K4 crystal.
Subsequently, the absence of correlation between Ecoh and dynamical stability is shown.
The values of B0 also decrease with the increasing pe- riod of X, similar to the case of Ecoh.
The B0s of XC2 are generally smaller than that of C. There is a strong correlation between B0 and Ecoh as indicated by the cor- relation coeﬃcient: rEcoh−B0=0.848.
From the values of a and V0 in Si and SrSi2, the relation shown in the C and XC2 systems also seems to hold for the Si and XSi2 systems.
However, the values of Ecoh and B0 of SrSi2 are larger than those of Si.
This relation is apparently diﬀerent from the cases of C and XC2 systems.
This can be attributed to the X-Si bond strength being much higher than that of the Si-Si bonds in XSi2.
To understand the correlation between the stability and the structure in detail, the nearest-neighbour dis- tances between diﬀerent atoms speciﬁed in Fig. 1(e) d C-C, d X-CA, d X-CB, d X-CC, d X-C (the average of all d X-C) and d X-X as well as the angle ∠X-CA-CB, and the minimal dihedral angle for the nearest-neighbour C atoms ∠C-C-C-C are investigated.
As shown in Fig. 2(b), in general d C-C, d X-C and d X-X increase with the increasing atomic number in X, similar to the cases of a and V0.
The d C-C and d X-C show very strong correlation with the a, indi- cated by the correlation coeﬃcients: ra−dC−C=0.930 and ra−dX−C=0.987.
These distances have also correlation with Ecoh: rEcoh−dC−C=-0.630 and rEcoh−dX−C=-0.741, although the values are smaller.
It is apparent that the correlations shown in d X-C with a and Ecoh are resulted from the very strong correlation of d X-CA and d X-CB with a and Ecoh as indicated by the correla- tion coeﬃcients: ra−dX−CA =0.824, ra−dX−CB =0.973, ra−dX−CC =0.180, rEcoh−dX−CA=-0.759, rEcoh−dX−CB =- 0.796, and rEcoh−dX−CC =-0.051.
Here, it should be noted that the each inequivalent atomic distance between X and C: d X-CA, d X-CB, and d X-CC show interesting X dependence.
The XC2 systems with X of 3rd, 4(5)th periods show distinct diﬀerences between X=IA and IIA, and other Xs.
In the compound3 with X=IA or IIA, the d X-CA and d X-CB are relatively larger while d X-CC is smaller compared with those of the other compounds with X of the neighbour atomic number.
The angle ∠X-CA-CB show distinct smaller values for the compounds with X=IA and IIA and this is attributed to the X dependence of the d X-CA and d X-CB.
The dihedral angle ∠C-C-C-C shown in Tab. II also show smaller values for the compounds with X=IA or IIA although the diﬀerences with other compounds are very small.
Apparently, those diﬀerences are due to the number of the outer most valence electrons in X.
However, an exceptional trend is shown in the systems with X of 2nd period for those values and the trend can be attributed to the elemental closeness between the X and C.
The relative position of X in the crystal is maintained resulting in ra−dX−X=1.000.
Therefore, d X-X can be considered as a standard distance in the XC2 systems.
To emphasize the similarity of the structures, various distance ratios of the nearest-neighbour distances to d X-X are shown in Fig. 2(c).
Although signiﬁcant larger (smaller) d C-C / d X-X, d X-C / d X-X, and d C-CC / d X-X (d C-CA / d X-X) are shown in the crystals with X=C, N, and O, these ratios are almost constant in the same group of X. In Figure 3, the phonon density of states(DOS) with- out step (4) for C and XC2 (X=H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb or Sr), Si and SrSi2 with K4 type ﬂame of C or Si are depicted.
From the above discussions and Fig. 2(a), the intermediate value of a realized for the compounds with X in 3rd (4th) (4.5-4.8 ˚A ) and the accompanied inter- atomic distances in these crystals seem to make the band narrower.
Namely, the inter atomic distances roughly de- termine the vibrational frequency range in these crystals.
The imaginary frequency modes rarely appear in NaC2, MgC2 and SrSi2 although they appear in relatively wide imaginary frequency range in C and Si.
For the structures of C, NaC2, MgC2, Si and SrSi2 obtained after step (4), the phonon DOS and dispersion relationship are also evaluated.
As shown in Fig. 4, the phonon DOS for the fully optimized structures of the other XC2 crystals show almost the same shapes as those of the optimized structures from step (3).
Therefore, it is expected that the discussion in the previous paragraph is signiﬁcant and skipping step (4) is expected to be ef- fective for reducing the computational cost in this study.
As shown in Figure 4, in carbon K4, although the imag- inary frequency mode is not appear at the Γ point, it appear in wide range of other k points as indicated by Yao et al 5.
On the other hand, silicon K4 has imaginary modes even at the Γ point.
Namely, the carbon and sil- icon K4 crystal structures are on a high rank of saddle points in those potential energy surfaces and the lifes of them are expected to be very short in nature.
On the other hand, in our calculations although NaC2, MgC2 and SrSi2 have imaginary frequencies in the acous- tic modes slightly around the Γ point, there are no imag- inary modes in the other k points.
These suggest that those structures are stable although they break the struc- tures against the phonon vibration with long wave length limit.
The existence of the SrSi2 K4 in nature6 sug- gests that the results in this study based on the density functional theory can predict the thermal stability of the structure.
From this fact and the calculation results, the stable existence of K4 type crystal structures in NaC2 and MgC2 is expected in nature although they do not realize maximum Ecoh in the considered XC2 crystals.
From the maximum frequencies obtained for diamond (1300 cm−1 for C18, 500 cm−1 for Si19) and graphite (1600 cm−1 for C)18, the orders of both C-C and Si-Si chemical bonds can be considered less than 1, as dis- cussed by Yao et al 5.
Therefore, based on the rough expectation from the mono atomic systems, the orders are expected to be less than 1 between the atoms com- posing K4 type ﬂame of NaC2, MgC2 and SrSi2 crystals.
The characters of chemical bonds are analysed from the valence charge distribution as described below.
To understand the stability of the K4 systems, the va- lence charge distributions are analysed.
Fig. 5 shows var- ious types of distribution in the conventional or the prim- itive unit cells for the fully optimized C, NaC2, MgC2, Si and SrSi2 crystals with K4 type ﬂame.
Fig. 5(a) de- tails planes selected to show the distribution of quantities noted in Figs. 5(c), (e), and (g).
The populations around the Sr atoms are neglected for easier comparison in Figs. 5(c) and (e).
Figures 5(b) and (c) show the isosurface and contour of charge density.
Apparently, the valence charge is lo- cally distributed along the lines between adjacent C or Si atoms of the K4 type ﬂame for the considered sys- tems.
It should be noted that a distinctive diﬀerence ap- pears between the charge distribution of the C(XC2) and Si(SrSi2) crystals in the intermediate region between the nearest-neighbour atoms in those ﬂames.
The charge is more localized to the C than Si atoms.
These features are also indicated in the diamond crystal structures as shown in the previous studies20.
It can be said that the atomic intercalation change the distribution slightly.
However, as discussed for the phonon frequencies, this quantity is suﬃcient to change the properties of the crystals.
Figures 5(d) and (e) shows the diﬀerences between the valence charge density of the crystals (ex. ρNaC2(r)) and their separated components: the intercalated atoms (ex. ρNa(r)) and the ﬂame (ex. ρC2(r)).
As shown in Fig. 5(d) , the signiﬁcant excess charge is shown in the region between the adjacent Na-C, Mg-C and Sr-Si for NaC2, MgC2 and SrSi2, respectively; therefore suggesting bond creation in those regions.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5(e), in NaC2, MgC2 and SrSi2, the charge accumula- tions increase in the region of π type orbitals while those decrease along the σ type bonds; suggesting that the π type bonds are strengthened and the σ type bonds are weakened.
On the other hand, the maximum frequency of the phonon modes shown in Fig. 4 is less than the mono atomic systems.
Therefore, the net bond orders in4 the K4 type ﬂame are expected to be decreased by the atomic intercalation.
Here, the nature of the bonds is noted from the infor- mation of the ELF.
Figs. 5(f) and (g) show the isosur- face (0.8 [-]) and the contour.
As shown here, C, NaC2, MgC2, Si and SrSi2 has similar ELF distribution between the adjacent C-C and Si-Si.
However, the feature of π type bonds formation is strengthened with signiﬁcance.
The relatively smaller value of ∠C-C-C-C (∠Si-Si-Si-Si) seems to have correlation with this feature.
The strength- ened π type bonds seem to stabilize the structures against the themal vibration.
From the comparison with the case of graphite, the absense of the π type bonds indicated by Yao et al.5, is not conﬁrmed in our calculations.
The stabilization of atomic intercalated carbon crystals is realized from delicate balance of bonding.
As shown in the valence charge density, the formation of strongly po- larized σ type bonds between Na or Mg and CA and the strength enhanced π bonds seems to stabilize the struc- ture of NaC2 and MgC2.
The discriminative stability seems to be realized by the properous atomic radii of X and the completion or near completion of the electronic shell of the each C atom in the K4 type ﬂame by X=IA or IIA.
Similar mechanism of the stability is expected to exist in the Si and XSi2 systems.
Figure 6 shows X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns of the fully optimized crystal structure of C, NaC2, MgC2, Si and SrSi2.
Monochromatic radiation with wave length 1.541 ˚A is assumed in these calculations.
As shown in this ﬁgure, the compounds have speciﬁc XRD peaks at larger 2θ compared with the pure K4 crystals.
Figure 7 shows the electron band structures, DOS, and local DOS of valence electrons for the atoms composing K4 type ﬂame and the intercalated atoms in the fully op- timized C, NaC2 and MgC2 and the Si and SrSi2 crystals, respectively.
From the bottom energy levels to the upper levels, the angular momentum for the electronic states successively changes in the order of s, p and d character, although every component appears in most states.
From the bottom energy levels to those around the Fermi level, the band structures are similar in these crystals.
NaC2 and MgC2 K4 show a metallic and semi conducting fea- ture, respectively, while carbon K4 is metallic.
As shown in Fig. 6, both Si and SrSi2 have metallic features.
It is noteworthy that the previous ﬁrst principles calculations for SrSi217 also show qualitatively the same result with the present calculation. IV.
CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY The stability of the atomic intercalated carbon K4 crystals, XC2 (X=H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb, and Sr), are evaluated from the geometry optimization and the frozen phonon analysis based on the ﬁrst principles calculations.
NaC2 and MgC2 are found to be stable al- though C K4 is not stable.
The formation of strongly polarized σ type bonds between Na or Mg and CA and the strength enhanced π bonds seems to stabilize the structure of NaC2 and MgC2.
The discriminative stabil- ity seems to be realized by the properous atomic radii of X and the completion or near completion of the electronic shell of the each C atom in the K4 type ﬂame by X=IA or IIA.
The NaC2 and MgC2 are found to be metallic and semi conducting, respectively.
