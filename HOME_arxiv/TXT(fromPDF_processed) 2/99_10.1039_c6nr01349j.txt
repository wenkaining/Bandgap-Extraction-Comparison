In this paper, we systematically investigated the phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) based on ﬁrst-principles calculations.
Despite the similar puckered (hinge-like) structure along the armchair direction as phosphorene, the four monolayer compounds possess diverse anisotropic properties in many aspects, such as phonon group velocity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal conductivity (κ), etc.
Especially, the κ along the zigzag and armchair directions of monolayer GeS shows the strongest anisotropy while monolayer SnS and SnSe shows an almost isotropy in phonon transport.
The origin of the diverse anisotropy is fully studied and the underlying mechanism is discussed in detail.
With limited size, the κ could be eﬀectively lowered, and the anisotropy could be eﬀectively modulated by nanostructuring, which would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal management.
Our study oﬀers fundamental understanding of the anisotropic phonon transport properties of 2D materials, and would be of signiﬁcance for further study, modulation and applications in emerging technologies.
I. INTRODUCTION The bulk orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe possessing puckered (hinge-like) layered structure similar to black phospho- rous have become a hot spot of recent researches.1–6 The advantages of group IV-VI compounds, such as earth-abundance, environmental compatibility, less tox- icity, and chemical stability, make them very attrac- tive for large-scale applications in photovoltaics and thermoelectrics.1,2,6–9 There have been a lot of studies on their optical properties including the photoconductivity, refractive index and infrared- and Raman-activity from experiments10–13 and ﬁrst-principles calculations.14,15 The large thermopower, high power factors, and low thermal conductivities estimated using Cahill’s model16 make these four orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds promising candidates for high-eﬃcient thermoelectric materials.17 Bulk SnSe is especially a robust thermo- electric candidate for energy conversion applications in the low and moderate temperature range due to its anisotropic and low symmetry crystal structure.1,2 The discovery of graphene leads to an upsurge in exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials,18–21 such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), germanene, silicene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and phospho- rene, which have attracted tremendous attention due to their unique dimension-dependent properties.22 In addi- tion to the currently available 2D materials, 2D SnSe has been recently synthesized, which is greatly expected to be potential in the applications as photodetector, pho- tovoltaic, piezoelectric and thermoelectric devices.23–27 Monolayer SnSe is also reported to be a promising 2D anisotropic semiconductor for nanomechanics, thermo- electrics, and optoelectronics,28 and the quantum spin Hall eﬀect was predicted in (111)-oriented thin ﬁlms of SnSe.29 Beyond the speciﬁc studies on 2D SnSe, there have also been a lot of studies on the optical properties of the four 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe.12–14 Furthermore, they are also reported as ﬂexible, stable, and eﬃcient 2D piezo- electric materials possessing enormous, anisotropic piezo- electric eﬀects with the piezoelectric coeﬃcients about two orders of magnitude larger than those of other 2D or bulk materials, such as MoS2, GaSe, bulk quartz and AlN, which are widely used in industry.25,30 These novel 2D anisotropic semiconductors, which attracted tremen- dous interest recently, have great potential applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and thermoelectrics, calling for fundamental study of the phonon transport properties.
However, the phonon transport properties of these 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds are still2 less known except monolayer SnSe.26–28 A complete and comparative prediction and understanding of the under- lying phonon transport properties is the key to expand the range of their applications in nanoelectronics, opto- electronics and thermoelectrics.
In this paper, we conduct comprehensive investiga- tions of the diverse phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltzmann transport equa- tion (BTE) based on ﬁrst-principles calculations.
The four monolayer compounds, although possessing similar hinge-like structure along the armchair direction as phos- phorene, show diverse anisotropic properties in many as- pects, such as phonon group velocity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal conductivity (κ), etc.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II, we brieﬂy describe the methodology for the ﬁrst-principles calcu- lations and the Boltzmann transport theory of phonon transport. In Sec.
III and IV, the optimized structures and phonon dispersions for the studied systems are pre- sented, respectively.
In Sec. V, we study the phonon transport properties of the four monolayer compounds with hinge-like orthorhombic structure.
Furthermore, a detailed analysis on the diverse anisotropic proper- ties is presented in Sec.
VI from diﬀerent aspects, in- cluding mode level κ and average phonon group veloc- ity, phonon scattering channels and electron localization function (ELF).
In Sec. VII, the eﬀect of ﬁnite size on κ and the anisotropy is studied.
In Sec. VIII, we present the summary and conclusions. II.
METHODOLOGY All the ﬁrst-principles calculations are performed based on the density functional theory (DFT) using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method31 as im- plemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (vasp)32.
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)33 of gen- eralized gradient approximation (GGA) is chosen as the exchange-correlation functional.
The kinetic energy cut- oﬀof wave functions is 650 eV for GeS and SnS, and 550 eV for GeSe and SnSe, respectively, which are 2.5 times the maximal recommended cutoﬀin the pseudo- potentials.
A Monkhorst-Pack34 k-mesh of 11 × 11 × 1 is adopted to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ) of all the four monolayer compounds, with the energy convergence threshold set as 10−8 eV. In the supercell calculations for obtaining harmonic (second order) interatomic force con- stants (IFCs) and anharmonic (third order) IFCs, only Γ point in the reciprocal space is used for the purpose of saving resources.5 For 2D systems, a large vacuum spac- ing is necessary to avoid the interactions between layers arising from the employed periodic boundary conditions.
The vacuum spacing is set as at least 15 ˚A along the out- of-plane direction that is suﬃciently large.
Both the cell shape and volume are fully optimized and all atoms are allowed to relax until the maximal Hellmann-Feynman force acting on each atom is no larger than 0.001 eV/˚A.
A suﬃcient large supercell is necessary for the accu- rate prediction of phonon dispersions, which is impor- tant for determining the phonon group velocities and phonon-phonon interactions that is critical for predict- ing thermal properties.
In principle, the supercell should be constructed to ensure lattice constants to be at least larger than 10 ˚A.
To determine the supercell size used in the real-space ﬁnite displacement diﬀerence calcula- tions, we performed calculations with the supercell size of 2 × 2 × 1, 3 × 3 × 1, 4 × 4 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 1.
The corresponding phonon dispersion curves show a conver- gent tendency as the supercell size increasing, such as the coupling among optical and acoustic phonon branches, the smoothness of the phonon dispersion curves, the fre- quency shift of phonon modes at Γ-point, and the ﬂat dispersions near the S symmetry point.
Since there is no diﬀerence between the results obtained with the supercell size of 4 × 4 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 1, it is doubtless that the supercell size of 5 × 5 × 1 is a good choice.
The force constant Ciα;jβ can be obtained from the force caused by displacement: Ciα;jβ = −Fiα ∆jβ , (1) where Fiα is the force along the α direction acting on atom i resulted from the displacement along the β di- rection of atom j (∆jβ).
The displacement amplitude of atom along the ±x, ±y and ±z directions are 0.01 ˚A.
The space group symmetry properties are used to reduce the calculation cost and numerical noise of the force con- stants, and it can also greatly simplify the determination of the dynamical matrix that is constructed based on the force constants.
The frequency and eigenvector forming the phonon dispersions can be obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix.
Besides the harmonic IFCs obtained above, anhar- monic IFCs, which are used for the determination of the scattering properties, are also necessary in the calcula- tion of lattice thermal conductivity (κ).
A 4 × 4 × 1 supercell is constructed to get the anharmonic IFCs, and the ﬁrst-principles based real-space ﬁnite displacement diﬀerence approach is employed.
A cutoﬀradius (rcutoﬀ) is introduced to discard the interactions between atoms with distance larger than a certain value for practical pur- poses.
In principle, the rcutoﬀshould exceed the range of physically relevant anharmonic interactions to get satis- factory results.35,36 Here, referring to the converged cut- oﬀradius as examined in the previous work, we choose a cutoﬀradius of about 6.5 ˚A, which includes up to 15th, 14th, 13th and 11th nearest neighbors for GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe, respectively.5 The dielectric tensor and Born eﬀective charges are also obtained to take into ac- count of long-range electrostatic interactions.
We choose the thickness of monolayer as half the length of the lattice constant along the out-of-plane direction of the layered bulk counterpart, which contains two layers in the con- ventional cell.37 The speciﬁc values of the thickness of3 the four monolayer compounds are listed in Table I.
The lattice thermal conductivity (κ) is calculated by solving the linearized BTE for phonons.
At thermal equi- librium, the phonons are distributed obeying the Bose- Einstein function f0(ωλ) in the absence of temperature gradient or other thermodynamical forces.38 The λ is the index of phonon mode comprising both phonon polariza- tion p and wave vector q.
The ωλ is the angular fre- quency.
In the steady state with a temperature gradient ∇T , the phonon distribution function fλ deviates from f0(ωλ) and this deviation can be obtained from the BTE: ∂fλ ∂t = ∇T · vλ ∂fλ ∂T , (2) where vλ is the phonon group velocity.
The left side is the scattering term that can be determined by taking into account the anharmonic scattering due to intrinsic phonon-phonon interactions and the harmonic scatter- ing due to defects and impurities such as isotopes.38 The right side is the diﬀusion term caused by the tempera- ture gradient ∇T .
Assuming a small enough ∇T in most practical situations, Eq. (2) can be linearized in ∇T and re-written as: fλ −f0(ωλ) = −Fλ · ∇T df0 dT , (3) where Fλ = τ0 λ(vλ +∆λ) when only considering the scat- tering mechanism of three-phonon processes.39–42 Here, τ 0 λ is the relaxation time obtained from perturbation the- ory, which is commonly used within the relaxation time approximation (RTA), and ∆λ in the dimension of veloc- ity is a correction of the deviation to the RTA prediction.
The τ 0 λ can be computed as: 1 τ 0 λ = 1 N  + X λ′λ′′ Γ+ λλ′λ′′ + − X λ′λ′′ 1 2Γ− λλ′λ′′ + X λ′ Γλλ′ !
, (4) where N = N1 × N2 × N3 is the number of discrete q sampling in the BZ, which should be tested for the con- vergence of κ, and Γ+ λλ′λ′′ and Γ− λλ′λ′′ are three-phonon scattering rates corresponding to absorption and emis- sion processes of phonons, respectively,39–42 and Γλλ′ is the scattering possibility resulted from the disorder of isotopic impurity.43,44 Eq. (3) is numerically solved by iterating from a zeroth order approximation start of Fλ = τ 0 λvλ.
If the itera- tion stops at the ﬁrst step, the procedure is equivalent to the operation in the RTA.
The iterative procedure has a large impact on the study of materials such as diamond in which the normal processes play a signiﬁcant role in the phonon-phonon scattering.40 In such situations, the RTA treating the normal processes resistive cannot yield rea- sonable results.
In contrast, in materials such as Si and Ge with strong Umklapp scattering, iterating to conver- gence only leads to a less than 10% increase of the room temperature κ compared to the RTA result.39 Based on the solution, the heat ﬂux can be calculated and the κ FIG.

The approach described above yields predictive pa- rameter free estimate of κ using only basic information of the chemical structure, and has been implemented in the ShengBTE code36,38 as employed in this work. III.
STRUCTURES The cell shape, volume and atoms are fully relaxed till convergence reached.
Along with the monolayer of black phosphorus that is called phosphorene, the optimized structures of monolayer GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe are shown in Fig. 1(a) from left to right.
All these mono- layer materials belong to the same orthorhombic crystal system, and possess similar hinge-like structure along the armchair direction, which is a typical feature distinctly diﬀerent from the ﬂat graphene and buckled silicene.
As reviewed in previous work, the hinge-like structure will introduce strong anisotropic properties.45,46 For example, it is harder along the zigzag direction than that along the armchair direction, which can be veriﬁed by the Young’s modulus.
The hinge-like orthorhombic structure gener- ally leads to the lattice constants being larger along arm- chair direction than along zigzag direction.
The obtained lattice constants along the two lattice directions are dif- ferent, as listed in Table I.

The Γ-X and Γ-Y correspond to the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively.
small is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe.
Com- pared with monolayer GeS and GeSe, the diﬀerence of lattice constants along the two directions for monolayer SnS and SnSe are very small, leading to their symmet- ric square-like lattice structures.
This symmetric square- like lattice structure may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the atomic bonding along the two directions, and will lead to their less anisotropic properties, as we will see later.
All the space groups of the four monolayer compounds are the same Pmn21 (No. 31), possessing 4 symmetry operators, which is diﬀerent from that of phosphorene (Pmna (No. 53), possessing 8 symmetry operators).
The lower symmetry of the four monolayer compounds com- pared with phosphorene lies in the diﬀerent types of atoms constituting the compounds, in which the two sub- layers are not parallel to each other.
It is interesting to note from Fig. 1(a) that the metallic atoms Ge interpose between the non-metallic (metalloid) atoms Se along the out-of-plane direction in monolayer GeSe, which is diﬀer- ent from that in monolayer GeS, SnS and SnSe where the non-metallic atoms interpose between the metallic atoms along the out-of-plane direction.
The diﬀerence may be due to the same period of Ge and Se in the peri- odic table resulting in the closest mass of the two atoms and the smallest electronegativity diﬀerence in the binary compound. IV.
PHONON DISPERSIONS In the calculation of phonon dispersions, a 5×5×1 su- percell containing 100 atoms is constructed and the ﬁrst- principles based ﬁnite displacement diﬀerence method is employed.47,48 As shown in Fig. 2, the phonon disper- sions of monolayer GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe have no imaginary part, indicating the thermodynamic stability of the four monolayer compounds.
There exist 3 acoustic and 9 optical, that is 12 in total, phonon branches corre- sponding to the 4 atoms per unit cell.
The three lowest phonon branches are acoustic phonon branches, i.e., the out-of-plane ﬂexural acoustic (FA) branch, the in-plane transverse acoustic (TA) branch and the in-plane longi- tudinal acoustic (LA) branch.
The TA and LA branches is linear near the Γ point while the FA branch is ﬂexural, which is similar to other 2D materials such as graphene, silicene, and phosphorene.46,49–53 This ﬂexural feature is typically due to the 2D nature of monolayer structure.50 The four monolayer compounds show very similar dis- persion curves along the path passing through the main high-symmetry k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) except: 1) The phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS and GeSe are separated into two regions with each region possessing 6 branches.
There exists a gap be-5 tween the two regions.
The gap is 2.014 THz for mono- layer GeS and 0.105 THz for monolayer GeSe.
How- ever, there is no similar gap for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
2) The phonon dispersions of SnS and SnSe are characterized by markedly dispersive optical phonon branches, which lead to the disappearance of the gap and result in signiﬁcant group velocities of optical phonon branches.
3) The frequencies of the four monolayer com- pounds are diﬀerent, especially the maximum frequency (ωM) of optical phonon branches at Γ point, and the or- der of ωM is monolayer GeS > SnS > GeSe > SnSe.
This may be owing to the diﬀerent reduced atomic mass (µ = m1m2/(m1 + m2)) that the larger the µ the lower the maximum frequency.
The order of µ of the four monolayer compounds is GeS < SnS < GeSe < SnSe that is opposite to the order of ωM. From the overview of Fig. 2, it is obvious that mono- layer SnS and SnSe possess almost symmetric phonon dispersion curves along the Γ-X-S (left) and Γ-Y-S (right) high-symmetry k-paths, while the symmetry for mono- layer GeS is most broken, especially for the low-frequency phonon modes.
As a result, the anisotropy of phonon group velocity along the two diﬀerent directions of mono- layer SnS and SnSe is tiny, and that of monolayer GeS and GeSe is much larger.
Based on the slope of the LA branch near the Γ point, we could get the group velocities along Γ-X (zigzag) and Γ-Y (armchair) direc- tions, respectively.
As listed in Table I, the speciﬁc val- ues of the group velocities of the four monolayer com- pounds show diﬀerent anisotropy along the zigzag and armchair directions.
The anisotropy of group velocities along the two directions from large to small is mono- layer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe.
From the lattice constants as listed in Table I, it is found that the order of anisotropy of group velocities is the same as that of lattice constants.
It is reviewed in previous work that the hinge-like structure of phosphorene is the key to the strong anisotropy of its properties.45,46 However, mono- layer SnSe shows an almost isotropic behavior despite its similar hinge-like structure as phosphorene.
The reason may lie in the symmetric square-like lattice structure28 and the large atomic mass of Sn and Se, which counter- act the anisotropy introduced by its hinge-like structure.
V. PHONON TRANSPORT PROPERTIES Based on the harmonic and anharmonic IFCs, the lat- tice thermal conductivity (κ) is calculated by solving the linearized BTE for phonons.
The phonon Q-grid sam- pling (N × N) in the BZ as shown in Eq. (4) has been fully tested for the convergence of κ.
The N of 46, 68, 47 and 48 are chosen for getting the convergent κ of mono- layer GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe, respectively.
The much denser Q-grid needed for getting convergent κ for mono- layer GeSe is directly due to the much slower convergence of the κ along armchair direction.
The reason might lie in the fact that there are more long-wavelength phonons 9.8 5.9 3.2 3.0 1.8 2.9 4.6 3.0 2.6 0.8 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 3 6 9 12 15     298 300 302 2.92 2.94 2.96 2.98                  zigzag  armchair     GeS                    GeSe                 SnS                    SnSe              bulk SnSe          Temperature (K) (Wm -1 K -1 ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 (b)  zigzag  armchair      (Wm -1 K -1 ) GeS         GeSe      SnS        SnSe    bulk SnSe T=300K (a) FIG.

The phenomenon is consistent with the largest rMFP along armchair direc- tion of monolayer GeSe as shown in Table I.
By employ- ing the iterative method, the obtained κ along zigzag and armchair directions of the four monolayer compounds at diﬀerent temperatures are collected together for compar- ison, as shown in Fig. 3.
The speciﬁc values of κ at 300 K are listed in Table I.
We also calculated the κ by using the RTA method, and found that iterating to conver- gence will lead to monolayer GeS: (36.5%, 22.3%), GeSe: (13.9%, 8.7%), SnS: (15.8%, 16.5%) and SnSe: (11.6%, 11.3%) increase of the room temperature κ compared to the RTA results, which means stronger Umklapp scat- tering existing in monolayer GeSe, SnS and SnSe than6 TABLE I.

The two numbers in the parentheses are the ratio of increase for zigzag and armchair directions, respectively.
The calculated κ at diﬀerent temperatures as shown in Fig. 3(a) decrease with temperature increas- ing.
By ﬁtting with the relation of κ ∼1/T α, the param- eter α are almost equal to 1, as listed in Table I, which is consistent with the common behavior of κ at medium temperatures for semi-conductors.46,54,55 The average κ along the two directions of the four monolayer compounds and bulk SnSe are GeS (6.38 Wm−1K−1), GeSe (5.23 Wm−1K−1), SnS (3.08 Wm−1K−1), SnSe (2.77 Wm−1K−1) and bulk SnSe (1.31 Wm−1K−1), respectively.
They possess the rather low thermal conductivity compared to a lot of ma- terials, such as h-BN, MoS2, graphene, silicene, phospho- rene, etc.46,51,53,56,57 The κ is strongly aﬀected by the scattering processes, which can be inﬂuenced by the an- harmonic nature of structure and the number of allowed three-phonon scattering processes, which are quantiﬁed as the Gr¨uneisen parameters (γ) and anharmonic phase space volume (P3), respectively.5 The order of κ is mono- layer GeS > GeSe > SnS > SnSe > bulk SnSe, which is consistent with the order of P3 as shown in Fig. 4(c) except monolayer GeS.
Though monolayer GeS has the largest κ, it does not possess a smallest P3.
However, its γ at low frequency range is obviously much smaller than the other monolayer compounds.
The anharmonic nature of monolayer GeS is weak compared to the other mono- layer compounds, resulting in its largest κ.
The largest κ of monolayer GeS could also be understood from its phonon dispersion. As compared in Sec.
IV, the phonon dispersion of monolayer GeS possess the largest gap of 2.014 THz (Fig. 2(a)), which is much larger than that of monolayer GeSe (0.105 THz), while monolayer SnS and SnSe have no gap.
The large phonon energy gap causes that the scattering of acoustic phonon modes due to the optical phonon modes is much weaker58, which leads to the higher κ of monolayer GeS.
Though there is a big gap in the phonon dispersion of bulk SnSe as well, the κ of bulk SnSe is lower than that of monolayer SnSe.
The reason might be that the interactions be- tween layers in bulk SnSe leads to smaller phonon group velocity in the in-plane transport and enhanced scatter- ing of phonons due to the giant anharmonicity,59 thus result in the lower in-plane κ.
Considering the higher κ of monolayer SnSe than bulk SnSe, the thermoelectric performance of monolayer SnSe might be not as good as bulk SnSe.
But it is hard to deﬁnitely say how the thermoelectric performance would be, because it is de- termined by several strongly coupled quantities and the thermal conductivity contributed from phonons is only one of them.45 We also notice that the κ of bulk SnSe from calculations is larger than that from experiment.
The reason of the discrepancy may lie in two aspects: 1) The samples used for experimental measurements may have defects that would lower the κ. 2) For such a ma- terial with giant anharmonicity,59 only considering the third order IFCs for capturing the anharmonicity might be not suﬃcient.
The κ is anticipated to be further low- ered if higher order IFCs are considered.
To have a clear overview of the constituent of κ, the frequency dependent κ and average phonon group ve- locity of monolayer GeS, SnS, GeSe, SnSe and bulk SnSe along zigzag and armchair directions are plotted in Fig. 5.
As shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), the group velocities of monolayer SnS and SnSe of the optical phonon branches, especially around middle frequency range (where the phonon dispersion can be separated into two regions with each region containing 6 branches), are very large in a wide range.
This is consistent with the phonon dispersions of monolayer SnS and SnSe as shown in Fig. 2 that are characterized by markedly dis- persive optical phonon branches, which lead to their sig- niﬁcant group velocities.
From the frequency depen- dent κ as shown in the top panel, it is obvious that the κ at middle frequency range of monolayer SnS and SnSe takes up a relatively larger proportion than that of monolayer GeS and GeSe, which is due to their rela-7 FIG.

tively larger group velocities of the optical phonon modes at middle frequency range.
The relaxation time also have some inﬂuence on the contributions to κ of phonon branches.
For example, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the relax- ation time of monolayer GeS (black color) at high fre- quency range above the gap are much smaller than that at low frequency range below the gap.
Although mono- layer GeS have relatively large phonon group velocity at high frequency range, as shown in Fig. 5(a), optical phonon branches above the gap contribute little to κ.
As for bulk SnSe (cyan color), as shown in Fig. 4(b), the relaxation time at high frequency range above the gap of bulk SnSe are comparable to that at low frequency range below the gap, which is due to the valley of P3 as shown in Fig. 4(c).
Together with its relatively large phonon group velocity at high frequency range, as shown in the insert in Fig. 5(d) , optical phonon branches above the gap contribute a lot to κ.
The contributions of diﬀerent phonon branches(FA, TA, LA and optical) to κ at 300 K are extracted as listed in Table I.
The contributions of optical phonon branches increase with the increasing temperature, and at the same time the contributions of acoustic phonon branches decrease.
The cumulative κ as a function of the phonon mean free path (MFP) at 300 K for zigzag and armchair directions are ﬁtted to a single parametric function38,46 κ(l ≤lmax) = κ0 1 + l0/lmax , (6) respectively.
κ0 is the ultimate cumulated κ, lmax is the maximal MFP concerned, and l0 is the parameter to be evaluated by ﬁtting.
The ﬁtted curves reproduce the cal- culated data quite well and yield the parameter l0 for zigzag and armchair directions, respectively, which could be interpreted as the representative MFP (rMFP).
The rMFP, as listed in Table I, is helpful for the study of the size eﬀect on the ballistic or diﬀusive phonon transport, which is important for thermal design with nanostructur- ing.
The rMFP decrease with the increasing temperature due to the integral decrease of MFP and higher contribu- tions to κ coming from optical phonon branches at higher temperature.
Generally speaking, acoustic phonon branches pos- sess larger MFP while optical phonon branches possess smaller MFP, and for acoustic phonon branches lower frequency phonon modes possess larger MFP.
Higher contributions of optical phonon branches to κ will lead to smaller rMFP, and higher contributions of acoustic phonon branches to κ, especially from FA, will lead to larger rMFP.
It is noticed from Table I that the contri- butions to κ from optical phonon branches for monolayer SnS and SnSe are much larger than that for monolayer GeS and GeSe, and bulk SnSe has much larger contribu- tions to κ from optical phonon branches compared with the four monolayer compounds.
Thus bulk SnSe has the smallest rMFP, and monolayer SnS and SnSe have smaller rMFP than monolayer GeS and GeSe.
Further- more, for monolayer GeSe, the rMFP along zigzag direc- tion is much smaller than that along armchair direction, while for monolayer SnS, the rMFP along zigzag direc- tion is slightly smaller than that along armchair direc- tion.
For other monolayer compounds, the rMFP along zigzag direction is larger than that along armchair direc- tion.
For monolayer GeSe, contributions to κ from FA in zigzag direction is smaller than that in armchair di- rection while contributions to κ from optical branches in zigzag direction is larger than that in armchair direction.

For monolayer SnS, contributions to κ from FA in zigzag direction is smaller than that in armchair direction, and contributions to κ from optical phonon branches in zigzag direction is also smaller than that in armchair direction.
The two competing factors result in the slightly smaller rMFP in zigzag direction than that in armchair direction for monolayer SnS. For monolayer GeS, SnSe and bulk SnSe, contributions to κ from FA in zigzag direction is larger than that in armchair direction while contributions to κ from optical phonon branches in zigzag direction is smaller than that in armchair direc- tion, which is contrary to the case of monolayer GeSe.
Both factors together result in the larger rMFP in zigzag direction than that in armchair direction. VI.
ANALYSIS OF THE ANISOTROPY A. Anisotropy of phonon transport A distinct feature in Fig. 3 is that, all the four mono- layer compounds and bulk SnSe possess anisotropic κ.
To have a clear comparison of the anisotropy, we plot the κ along zigzag and armchair directions at 300 K for the four monolayer compounds and bulk SnSe in Fig. 3(b).
It is obvious that the κ of monolayer GeS possesses the strongest anisotropy compared to all the other monolayer compounds, and the κ along the zigzag direction of mono- layer GeS is much larger than others.
The κ along zigzag and armchair directions of monolayer SnSe shows less9 anisotropic behavior than that of bulk SnSe.
The order of anisotropy of the κ of the four monolayer compounds is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnSe > SnS.
We further calculated the Young’s modulus and found that its order of anisotropy is monolayer GeS > GeSe > SnSe > SnS, which is identical with that of κ.
The speciﬁc values of the Young’s modulus of the four monolayer compounds are listed in Table I, and the related elastic constants are shown in Table II. TABLE II.

(5).
The anisotropy of thermal conductivity is actually dominated by the anisotropy of phonon group velocity.60 A close view of Fig. 5 shows that the frequency dependent κ and average phonon group velocity are nearly isotropic for high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency (where the gap locates), which separates the phonon dispersion into two regions containing equal num- bers of branches.
The anisotropy along the two diﬀer- ent directions is conspicuous for low frequency phonon modes below the separatrix frequency, which is huge for monolayer GeS, small for monolayer GeSe, while al- most disappear for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
Note that the phonon dispersions of monolayer GeS and GeSe as shown in Fig. 2 are separated into two regions containing equal numbers of branches with a gap of 2.014 THz and 0.105 THz, respectively, while there is no gap for mono- layer SnS and SnSe.
Thus we analyzed that it is the regions below the separatrix frequency where the gap lo- cates that result in the anisotropy.
The anisotropy is strong for monolayer GeS and weak for monolayer GeSe due to the big gap in the phonon dispersions of mono- layer GeS and the small gap of monolayer GeSe.
While there is no gap of monolayer SnS and SnSe, their κ and phonon group velocity along the two diﬀerent direc- tions are almost isotropic.
Thus the anisotropy is associ- ated with the gap of phonon dispersions that the larger the gap the stronger the anisotropy.
If we could employ some methods such as strain or doping to modulate the gap, the anisotropy can be eﬀectively modulated, which would be of signiﬁcance in the thermal management ap- plications.
The inﬂuence of the gap on the anisotropy can be understood in terms of the coupling between the high and low frequency phonon modes at both sides of the separatrix frequency, which is supported by the scat- tering channels among phonon modes presented in the next section (Sec. VI B).
Since the frequency depen- dent average phonon group velocity of the four mono- layer compounds is nearly isotropic for high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency, the cou- pling will suppress the anisotropy of the low frequency phonon modes below the separatrix frequency when there is no gap.
When a gap exists, the coupling will be weak, leading to the presence of the anisotropy.
If the gap is very large, the coupling disappears, resulting in the appearance of the strong anisotropy of low frequency phonon modes.
Based on the analysis demonstrated above, we also would like to present a speciﬁc comparison for mono- layer SnSe and bulk SnSe.
Monolayer SnSe shows less anisotropic properties along zigzag and armchair directions than bulk SnSe.
There exist some diﬀer- ences between them: 1) The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence is that there is no interactions between layers in mono- layer SnSe.
2) The diﬀerence of lattice constants along the two directions of monolayer SnSe is much less than that of bulk SnSe, leading to its symmetric square-like lattice structure which determines its almost isotropic properties.
3) The Young’s modulus of monolayer SnSe is larger than that of bulk SnSe, which means that mono- layer SnSe is more rigid than bulk SnSe, leading to the larger phonon group velocity and κ of monolayer SnSe.
4) There is no gap in the phonon dispersion of monolayer SnSe, while there is a large gap for bulk SnSe.
The low and high frequency phonon modes at both sides of the gap are decoupled in bulk SnSe due to the large gap, re- sulting in the huge anisotropy of the phonon group veloc- ity and contributions to κ of low frequency phonon modes below the gap, as shown in the insert of Fig. 5(d).
Due to the lack of the gap in the phonon dispersion of monolayer SnSe, the coupling between the phonon modes will be very strong, leading to the suppression of the anisotropy.
B. Scattering channel The phonon scattering channels ruled by the conser- vation of energy are investigated to quantify the speciﬁc scattering processes due to diﬀerent phonon branches.
Since the phonon branches commonly degenerate or cross with each other in the most segments of the path passing through the main high-symmetry k-points in the IBZ as shown in Fig. 2, we only present in Fig. 6 the scatter- ing rate of acoustic phonon modes along Γ-Y direction where the acoustic phonon modes can be easily sepa- rated as LA, TA and FA, and the crossover problem is ﬁxed manually.
Both the scattering rates for absorption and emission processes as shown in Eq. (4) are addressed and the scattering rates for emission processes are multi- plied by 1/2 to avoid counting twice for the same process.

In the legend, ”A” means the acoustic phonon branches (LA, TA and FA), ”O1” means the 3 optical phonon branches with low frequency, ”O2” means the 6 optical phonon branches with high frequency.
The legends similar for LA, TA and FA are the same for (b) GeSe, (c) SnS and (d) SnSe, while that for (a) GeS is diﬀerent.
The crossover of LA, TA and O1 as shown in Fig. 2 is ﬁxed manually to distinguish them.
collected together as ”A”, the 3 low frequency optical phonon branches are collected together as ”O1”, and the 6 optical phonon branches with high frequency are col- lected together as ”O2”.
As discussed above, there exists a gap between O1 and O2 for monolayer GeS and GeSe, while the gap disappears for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
All the possible phonon scattering channels for the four monolayer compounds are plotted in Fig. 6.
Note that the phonon scattering channels are similar for GeSe, SnS and SnSe, while that for GeS is diﬀerent due to the lack of the scattering channels of LA/TA/FA+A/O1→O2, which is resulted from the large gap (2.014 THz) between O1 and O2 for monolayer GeS.
The major scattering channels that have a large contribution to the overall scattering for monolayer GeS are LA/TA/FA+A→A, LA/TA/FA→A+A and LA+A→O1.
In contrast, the major scattering channels for monolayer GeSe, SnS and SnSe are LA/TA/FA+A→O1.
The scattering between A and O1 phonon branches, especially for TA and FA, is highly enhanced due to the tiny or disappeared gap for monolayer GeSe, SnS and SnSe.
Furthermore, besides LA/TA/FA+A→O1, the scattering channels of TA/FA+O1→O1 for monolayer SnS, and the scatter- ing channels of LA/TA/FA+O1→O2, LA+A→O2 and TA/FA+O2→O2 for monolayer SnSe play a major role.
Along with the characteristics of their phonon dispersions as shown in Fig. 2, it can be concluded that a large gap will result in the decoupling between acoustic and high11 FIG.

frequency optical phonon modes, and when the gap is tiny or disappears, the phonon branches becomes close to each other, which will result in their strong couplings and lead to a remarkable scattering channel.
It is discussed above based on Fig. 5 that the phonon transport properties of the four monolayer compounds are nearly isotropic for high frequency phonon modes above the separatrix frequency (where the gap locates), which separates the phonon dispersion into two re- gions containing equal numbers of branches, while the anisotropy along the two diﬀerent directions is conspicu- ous for low frequency phonon modes below the separatrix frequency.
It is the phonon modes in the region below the separatrix frequency that result in the anisotropy.
The coupling between the phonon branches will suppress the anisotropy of the low frequency phonon modes when there is no gap.
When a gap exists, the coupling will be weak, leading to the presence of the anisotropy.
If the gap is very large, the coupling disappears, resulting in the appearance of the strong anisotropy of low fre- quency phonon modes.
Thus the anisotropy is huge for monolayer GeS, small for monolayer GeSe, while almost disappear for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
C. Electron localization functions The anisotropic behavior can also be understood from a fundamental view of the atomic bonding.
To picture the electron pair probability, we plot the ELF for the four monolayer compounds in Fig. 7.
The ELF contains in- formation on the structure of atomic shells, and also dis- plays the location and size of bonding and lone electron pairs.61 The ELF characterizes the probability of ﬁnding an electron with the same spin in the neighborhood space of the reference electron.
The smaller the probability the more localized the reference electron.
The ELF is pow- erful in interpreting chemical bonding patterns, ranging from 0 to 1,62 where 0 means no electron, 0.5 corresponds to electron-gas-like pair probability, and 1 corresponds to perfect localization.
As revealed in Fig. 7, the ELF along the zigzag di- rection for the four monolayer compounds are all larger than 0.5 (the value of uniform electron gas), which means that the electrons are localized.
The bonding makes the rigidity along zigzag direction, while for armchair direc- tion, the ELF are all smaller than 0.5, which means that the electrons are delocalized.
The ELF along armchair direction is obviously the smallest for monolayer GeS, resulting in its softest nature along the armchair direc- tion reﬂected by its smallest Young’s modulus as shown in Table. I.
The ELF along the two directions shows a big diﬀerence for monolayer GeS and GeSe, especially for monolayer GeS, while shows only a small diﬀerence for monolayer SnS and SnSe.
The anisotropic behav- ior of the ELF reﬂecting the bonding characteristics is the physical origin of the diverse anisotropic properties for the series of monolayer compounds with hinge-like orthorhombic structure. VII.
SIZE EFFECT It is well known that, with a larger rMFP, the ther- mal conductivity could be modulated more eﬀectively by nanostructuring.
If the rMFP is very small, the eﬀect of nanostructures with a typical size will be not signiﬁ- cant for the phonon transport.
As listed in Table I, bulk SnSe has the smallest rMFP, and the four monolayer compounds have larger rMFP than bulk SnSe, which means that it would be more eﬀective to modulate the phonon transport in the monolayer compounds by nanos- tructuring.
Furthermore, the phonon transport in mono- layer GeS and GeSe could be more eﬀectively modulated due to their larger rMFP compared to that in monolayer SnS and SnSe.
In order to address the size eﬀect on the phonon transport properties, the phonon boundary scat- tering due to the ﬁnite size should be considered, which can be estimated by the standard equation:63–65 1 τ B λ = 1 −p 1 + p |vλ| L , (7) where p is the specularity parameter, which means the fraction of specularly scattered phonons depending on the roughness of the edge, ranging from 0 for a completely rough edge to 1 for a perfectly smooth edge, vλ is the phonon group velocity of the phonon mode λ, and L is the system size usually ranging from nanometers to microm- eters.
The temperature gradient is assumed to be along the direction of the ﬁnite sample length.
Anisotropy due to ﬁnite sample size is ignored because of the relatively large sizes considered.37,66 Then the scattering rate of12 0 2 4 6 8 10 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5      (Wm -1 K -1 )                   zigzag  armchair    GeS                    GeSe                  SnS                    SnSe               bulk SnSe          (b) (a)     Anisotropy L (nm)  GeS  GeSe  SnS  SnSe  bulk SnSe FIG.

each phonon mode is calculated by the Matthiessen rule: 1 τλ = 1 τ anh λ + 1 τ iso λ + 1 τ B λ , (8) where 1/τ anh λ is the intrinsic anharmonic scattering rates due to phonon-phonon interactions, and 1/τ iso λ is the scattering rate due to isotopic impurity.
By considering a fully diﬀusive scattering at the bound- ary, i.e., p = 0, we plot the κ as a function of the system size as shown in Fig. 8(a).
When the size is up to near 105 nm, the κ for all the monolayer and bulk compounds almost converge to the value of inﬁnite system.
The κ de- creases with the size decreasing, and the κ along armchair direction of monolayer GeSe has the most rapid decrease, which is resulted from its largest rMFP of 72.51 nm.
It is obvious that when the size decreases the κ will de- crease faster with a larger rMFP.
It is also shown that the anisotropy of the κ is aﬀected by the ﬁnite size.
Gen- erally, the anisotropy will become weak due to the limited size.
The reason lies in that usually large κ corresponds to large rMFP and small κ corresponds to small rMFP.
Thus the large κ will have a bigger decrease than small κ with limited size, leading to the anisotropy of the κ becoming weak at short length.
Based on the κ and rMFP as listed in Table.
I, the anisotropy of the κ will become weak for monolayer GeS, SnSe and bulk SnSe with limited size, while the contrary is the case for mono- layer GeSe and SnS that the anisotropy of the κ will be- come strong with limited size.
The cases are conﬁrmed as shown in Fig. 8(b).
With limited size, the κ could be eﬀectively lowered and the anisotropy could be ef- fectively modulated by nanostructuring such as pattern- ing into nanoribbon or incorporating pores, which would extend the applications in thermoelectrics and thermal management.
Note that the size eﬀect studied here is es- timated based on diﬀusive phonon transport by consider- ing additional phonon boundary scattering.
If the ballis- tic phonon transport is eﬀectively involved, the thermal conductivity and its anisotropy might be slightly diﬀer- ent from current results at very small scales.67 For de- tailed study on the phonon transport properties of nanos- tructured systems, more eﬀective simulations should be performed, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). VIII.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have systematically investigated the diverse phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhom- bic group IV-VI compounds of GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe by solving the Boltzmann transport equation based on ﬁrst-principles calculations.
They all possess rather low thermal conductivity compared to lots of other 2D materials.
The contribution from each phonon branch is studied and its relation with the rMFP is also dis- cussed.
The four monolayer compounds, although pos- sessing similar hinge-like structure along the armchair direction as phosphorene, show diverse anisotropic prop- erties in many aspects, such as phonon group veloc- ity, Young’s modulus and lattice thermal conductivity (κ), etc.
Especially, the κ along the zigzag and arm- chair directions of monolayer GeS shows the strongest anisotropy while monolayer SnS and SnSe shows an al- most isotropy in phonon transport, despite the similar characteristics of their structures.
A detailed analysis on the diverse anisotropic properties of the series 2D orthorhombic compounds is presented.
The anisotropy of thermal conductivity is actually dominated by the anisotropy of phonon group velocity.
Based on the anal- ysis of the frequency dependent κ and average phonon group velocity, we ﬁnd that the anisotropy is mainly introduced by the region below the gap between the high frequency optical phonon modes and low frequency phonon modes in the phonon dispersions.
The larger the gap, the stronger the anisotropy.
The inﬂuence of the gap on the anisotropy can be explained from the coupling be- tween the phonon modes at both sides of the gap, which is supported by the phonon scattering channels.
The di- verse anisotropic behavior can also be understood from a fundamental view of the atomic bonding characterized by13 the ELF.
The anisotropic behavior of the ELF reﬂecting the bonding characteristics is the physical origin of the anisotropic properties.
The phonon transport in mono- layer GeS and GeSe can be more eﬀectively modulated by nanostructuring due to their larger rMFP compared to that in monolayer SnS and SnSe.
It is also shown that the anisotropy of the κ is aﬀected by the ﬁnite size.
With limited size, the κ could be eﬀectively low- ered, and the anisotropy could be eﬀectively modulated by nanostructuring, which would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal management.
This study not only present comprehensive investigations on the phonon transport properties of the new family of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI compounds (GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe), but also provide discussions and analy- sis on the origins of the diverse anisotropy, which enriches the understanding of nanoscale phonon transport in 2D materials, and would be of signiﬁcance for further study and applications in emerging technologies.
