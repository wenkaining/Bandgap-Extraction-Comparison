Two distinct superconducting transition temperature (TC) vs. pressure (P) trends at low pressure have been reported more than 30 years ago, and for the ﬁrst time we are able to reproduce them and devise a consistent explanation founded on thermodynamically metastable phases of black-phosphorous.
Our experimental and theoretical results form a single, consistent picture which not only provides a clear understanding of elemental P under pressure but also sheds light on the long-standing and unsolved anomalous superconductivity trend.
Moreover, at higher pressures we predict a similar scenario of multiple metastable structures which coexist beyond their thermodynamical stability range.
Metastable phases of P experimentally accessible at pressures above 240 GPa should exhibit TC’s as high as 15 K, i.e. three times larger than the predicted value for the ground-state crystal structure.
We observe that all the metastable structures systematically exhibit larger transition temperatures than the ground-state ones, indicating that the exploration of metastable phases represents a promising route to design materials with improved superconducting properties.
Introduction The discovery that sulfur hydride (SH3) is superconductor with a record-breaking critical transition temperature (TC) of 200 K1, has disproved a decades-long prejudice against high-TC occurring conventionally2,3.
This result demonstrated that extreme pressures represent a novel avenue to access new physical phenomena and exotic states of matter, which in the next years may lead to many surprises.
Sulfur hydride is not an isolated example of conventional high-TC superconductivity at high pressures, since a few months later also phosphine (PH3) has been observed to superconduct at transition temperatures as high as 100 K at 200 GPa4.
The case of phosphine it is even more fascinating than that of SH3, whose crystal structure and superconducting phase diagram have been largely studied and unambiguously determined both experimentally8,9 and theoretically10–17.
In fact, the same theoretical methods which were used successfully to predict SH3, show that at high pressure PH3 should decompose into its elemental components, phosphorus and hydrogen.
Since the ab-initio description of the thermodynamics of hydrides is in general quite accurate, the most likely explanation is that the reported superconducting phase of PH3 is to occur in a metastable structure of PHn (n = 1,2,3,4) stabilized by a particular, nevertheless reproducible experimental condition18,19.
Metastable phases, which can be accessed only under speciﬁc thermodynamical conditions, play a major role in determining the high pressures properties in many compounds; in some cases, they can lead to complicated superconducting phase diagrams, even for simple elements20.
The most prominent example is hydrogen, where the search for a possible metallic phase21, which could be a room- temperature superconductor22 has been going on for decades.
Actual hints for metalization have been recently reported in Ref.23 and were based on the temperature dependence of electrical resistance and disappearance of Raman spectra.
However the reported metallization in Ref.24 observed for atomic hydrogen based on reﬂectance of the sample is still debated25–27.
What is certain is that the metallic phase involves metastable phases that are only accessible at high pressures and precise temperatures23,28–30.

Summary of all the critical temperatures observed experimentally5–7 (top panels) and calculated theoretically in this work (bottom panels).
In the experimental panels the dashed and full lines are a guidelines-to-the-eye and used to distinguish the trend that we interpret as due to metastable black-P (dashed) from the energetically stable sequence of transformations (see text).
The color-bar at the bottom indicates the sequence of calculated ground-state structures; the color-code is explained in the legend of the bottom panels.
Although less spectacular in terms of critical temperature, phosphorus is another well-known example of elemental compound, which becomes superconducting under pressure and has a rich and complicated phase diagram31.
In this work, we present a thorough investigation of the superconducting properties of phosphorus under pressure, including new experiments at high pressure and, for the ﬁrst time, a fully ab-initio characterization.
We discovered that the structural metastability of phosphorus plays a crucial role in determining the superconducting phase diagram and unquestionably this is driven by pressure and temperature conditions.
Thanks to our ab-initio study we were able to disentangle the nature of the superconducting properties of P metastable phases and more importantly to predict that these phases have larger transition temperatures than the putative ground state ones.
2/14Results High-pressure Experiments The superconducting phase diagram of P is intriguingly complicated; the top panel of Fig. 1 compares the previous experimental results (gray symbols and lines) with our new experiments (black symbols and lines).
The ﬁrst accurate resistivity measurements on P under compression date back to 1985 and were performed by Kawamura et. al.5.
The authors reported for the ﬁrst time an anomalous behavior in the superconducting transition temperatures up to pressures of 30 GPa: the value of TC was found to strongly depend on the P−T path followed in experiment.
The problem was revisited by Karuzawa et. al.6 in early 2000’s, with a second set of experiments in which transition temperatures were measured for pressures of up to 97 GPa, producing a single TC trend.
More recently Guo et.
al.7 carried out Hall-electrical measurements under pressure up to 50 GPa, and reported a non-monotonic trend of TC at low pressures, and an anomaly due to a Lifshitz transition at ∼17 GPa.
Clearly, despite the effort and several experiments over decades, the explanation of the superconducting trends and more importantly the anomalous dependence on thermodynamic conditions remains unsolved.
Given the polymorphism of elemental phosphorus already at ambient conditions, one could speculate that the anomalous TC vs. P trends are caused by the coexistence of metastable phases.
Therefore, in the present work we design two different sets of experiments which speciﬁcally aim at accessing different phases (stable and metastable) following two P−T thermodynamic paths, as schematically illustrated in top panels of Fig.2.
In the ﬁrst set, Exp. 1, (the measured TC is reported as black circles in the top panel of Fig. 1) the sample is constantly kept at low temperature while pressure is increased.
In the second P−T path (Exp. 2) the temperature is raised at higher temperatures when applying pressure and for resistivity measurements.
In this ﬁgure bottom panels show the resistivity measurements at different pressures and TC’s are indicated with arrows.
Clearly the TC vs. P behavior of the two datasets is rather different.
In the ﬁrst set (black circles in Fig. 1) a slow increase of TC up to 25 GPa is observed, while for the second set of experiments TC sharply increases with pressure (black squares in Fig. 1).
The two data sets merge at 25 GPa, and a single trend is observed up to the highest common pressure measured (94 GPa).
Ab-initio Phase diagram of P under pressure Fig. 3 shows the computed enthalpy for different allotropes of phosphorus under pressure found using our crystal structure prediction method.
The enthalpy difference is shown with respect the sc (Pm−3m) phase.
The lowest-enthalpy sequence of transitions, according to the calculations, is the following: Red-P (triclinic P−1)32 is stable at 0 GPa and almost degenerate with black-P (Cmca)33, which is the experimentally observed phase; phase P−II (A7-R3m) occurs from 3 to 16 GPa.
The simple cubic (sc-P−III) lattice dominates for pressures up to 120 GPa, where the simple hexagonal lattice (sh-P6mmm) is stable up to ∼225 GPa.
We ﬁnd the bcc (Im−3m) crystal stable from 225 to 250 GPa and ﬁnally the last phase (I −43d ) is stable from 250 to beyond 350 GPa.
The sequence of transitions is shown as a color bar at the bottom of Fig. 1.
The three relevant pressure intervals, in which phase transitions take place, are highlighted in top panels of Fig. 3.
The ﬁrst one (left) shows the low-pressure regime.
At ambient conditions phosphorus is known in at least three different allotropic forms: black-P, red-P and white-P. Experimentally, black-P is the most stable form33 which transforms to the A7 phase34 for pressure above 5 GPa35.
In our calculations, red-P is the ground state at zero pressure (although is almost degenerate with black-P), while the stabilization energy of white-P is 130 meV per atom higher (or equivalently ∼1500 K).
The apparent disagreement is due to the fact that the standard Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functional used in this work is inaccurate for layered (van-der-Waals bonded) or polymeric systems in predicting the exact structural sequence for different polymorphisms.
However, although the Van-der-Waals interaction is rather important in the very low-pressure region of the phase diagram (0-5 GPa), it plays only a minor role at higher pressures, where superconductivity occurs.
We ﬁnd that black-P remains enthalpically competitive within a comparable order-of-magnitude ( ∼0.1 eV) with other low-enthalpy phases up to pressures as large as 30 GPa.
As will be discussed in detail in the next section, the meta-stability of this phase turns out to be fundamental to describe the experimental trend in TC.
The second panel (top central) of Fig. 3 shows the pressure interval in which the sh→bcc transition occurs.
In this window sc, sh (P6mmm), IM-Cmmm (not shown), bcc and, surprisingly, black-P (in a collapsed form) are structures that are all accessible within a few tens of meV energy difference.
This enthalpy landscape is consistent with experimental evidences that in this pressure range the sh→bcc transition occurs via an intermediate incommensurate phase36.
A third pressure range, worth analyzing in more detail (top right panel), is where the sh and bcc enthalpy curves cross each other and the bcc to I −43d transformation occurs (I −43d is a distorted form of bcc).
Note that in this case the enthalpy differences between all three phases are extremely small, i.e. within the computational accuracy, so that vibrational entropy corrections (not included) and stabilization of distorted complex structures34,37 could in principle affect the energetic ranking of the structures and the transition pressures.
However, these corrections will shift the transition pressure by no more than ∼5 GPa, which is below the experimental errors to estimate the pressure (∼10 GPa).
Indeed, our ab initio zero-temperature phase diagram is in substantial agreement with the sequence experimentally 3/14observed34–36,38–43, and is therefore a good starting point to calculate the superconducting critical temperatures as a function of the pressure.
Furthermore, our analysis has allowed us to characterize several of the structural transitions as ﬁrst-order, i.e. with a discontinuous P(V) behaviors (see Fig. 4); this could lead to a possible path to stabilize metastable structure under suitable thermodynamic conditions.
Ab-initio predicted superconducting temperatures Using state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory for Superconductors (SCDFT) combined with density-functional perturbation theory for the calculation of phonon dispersions and electron-phonon coupling and linear response theory in the random phase approximation for the evaluation of electron-electron repulsion, we have computed the superconducting properties (anomalous density and critical temperature, TC) for all the identiﬁed structures of P which are dynamically stable.
The corresponding TC’s are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1, as full (dashed) lines for ground-state (metastable) structures.
Low Pressures (0-50 GPa) As shown in the previous section, phosphorous has an extremely rich phase diagram of unique complexity; at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature its three most common polymorphs, black-P, red-P and white-P are semiconducting or insulating.
While black-P and red-P achieve metalization within a few GPa (estimating the exact value would require calculating corrections to the band-gap beyond DFT), white-P is still insulating at 7 GPa with a band gap of about 1.4 eV. Considering that DFT typically underestimates band gaps in insulators, this implies that white-P cannot be considered a candidate for the superconducting phase, and therefore will not be included in further investigations.
Also red-P is excluded as a possible superconducting phase in the low-pressure range, because, although dynamically stable for 10 and 15 GPa, the calculated TC is too low (< 1 K) to account for any experimental evidence of superconductivity.
Upon further compression our calculations shown that red-P collapses to a simple cubic lattice.
For black-P, on the contrary, the calculated TC, depicted as black line in Fig. 1, rapidly increases as a function of pressure.
This a consequence of the relatively strong electron-phonon coupling, which is consistent with previous predictions on doped black-P and phosphorene44.
This superconducting structure of black-P, which remains energetically metastable and dynamically stable for pressures up to 20 GPa, with transition temperatures as high as ≃13 K, is actually a modulated superstructure of the true black-P, obtained by supercell relaxation along soft directions.
Upon further compression the modulated black-P relaxes to the simple cubic lattice.
However, at pressures in which superconductivity occurs ( ∼10 GPa) the ground-state structure is not black-P, but A7-P, in good agreement with XRD measurements37 and previous theoretical calculations45.
In this phase the calculated evolution of TC is pressure-independent; TC does remains constant ∼7 K (red-line in bottom panel in Fig. 1).
Noticeably, we ﬁnd that the sudden increase in TC for pressures above 20 GPa occurs in correspondence to the A7 →sc second-order phase transition.
Our calculations show that this substantial increase in TC is not originated, as one could expect, from soft phonons inducing the structural transition which could consequently provide large electron-phonon coupling, but is instead triggered by an electronic Lifshitz transition46.
It does happen indeed that, upon increasing pressure, an additional band crosses the Fermi level, contributing to the electronic density of states (DOS) and providing a strong interband scattering channel that reinforces the Cooper pairing.
An extensive analysis of this effect is provided in the Supplemental Material.
The same behavior was recently predicted also in the superconducting properties of elemental sulfur under pressure47, which remarkably has many common aspects with phosphorus.
Once the Lifshitz transition is completed, TC marginally decreases with pressure as the occupation of the additional band increases, enhancing the electronic screening of the electron-phonon coupling.
As a consequence TC results rather featureless in the range between 40 to 100 GPa, where the only relevant phase is the sc one, showing TC’s decreasing with pressure, in agreement with previous estimation45.
Considering only the thermodynamically stable structures, the predicted TC follows closely the pressure dependence of the BCS-type coupling λ (Eq. 2), reported in Fig. 4 (blue curve in top panel).
This is due to the combination of three factors: ﬁrst, superconductivity is happening in the ”weak-coupling limit”, since the values of λ are between 0.4 and 0.7.
In this limit TC is extremely sensitive to λ.
Second, the characteristic phonon energy scale ωlog (Eq. 3) and red line in the upper panel of Fig. 4) shows almost no pressure dependence, as would occur in presence of phononic instabilities.
Third, the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons in the Cooper pairs, represented by the Coulomb pseudopotential parameter µ∗48,49, is constant and ≃0.1 for all structures and pressures, which is rather typical for sp-bonded systems.
More insight on the pressure-evolution of the characteristic ep coupling parameters for the thermodynamically stable phases can be obtained analyzing the pressure evolution of the electron-phonon spectral function α2F(ω), shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4.
In the plot, frequencies are shown in ordinates, pressures in abscissas, and the color scale indicates the intensity of the α2F(ω); strongly-coupled phonons appear as darker regions at the corresponding frequencies.
In general, the maximum phonon frequencies raise as pressure is increased.
Up to around 20 GPa, the coupling is concentrated in the high-frequency modes, while the distribution changes at higher pressures (25–50 GPa) where it appears more evenly distributed.
This means that, despite the pronounced hardening of the maximum phonon frequencies with pressure, the center of mass of the spectrum remains almost constant, and there are no signatures of lattice instabilities induced by electron-phonon coupling.
In contrast to the weak-coupling behavior of thermodynamically stable phases, metastable phases (black-P, sc, sh and bcc) 4/14exhibit a marked strong-coupling behavior at the limit of their dynamical stability range.
For these systems, upon approaching their structural transition, a considerable part of the phonon spectral weight is shifted to low frequencies, consequently increasing λ and a simultaneously decreasing ωlog.
Further details, including the calculated α2F(ω), λ, ωlog and the Coulomb screening parameters for all phases discussed in this work can be found in the Supplemental Material.
High Pressures (50-350 GPa) We will now analyze the high-pressure range, for which our calculated TC’s are summarized in the right bottom panel of Fig. 1.
In the sc phase, TC continues to decrease until the sc to sh transition occurs.
Since this is a transition of ﬁrst order, as the one from black-P to sc, we investigated the metastability of the two phases across their thermodynamic boundaries.
For higher and lower pressures and for both systems our calculations predicts dynamically stable structures: sc up to 150 GPa and sh down to 80 GPa.
Away from their thermodynamical phase boundaries, TC varies rapidly in both systems and this is due to a phonon softening that lowers the phonon energy and increases the coupling.
From 150 to 250 GPa, the TC of sh-P decreases steadily below 3 K, and this phase is therefore moderately interesting for superconductivity.
On the other hand, the bcc/I −43d sequence of structures, stable above 250 GPa, is more promising.
In fact, these phases show a larger TC, well above 10 K.
It is also worth mentioning that, between 220 and 250 GPa the bcc structure which is thermodynamically metastable, exhibits transition temperatures three times larger than those calculated for the sh structure.
Discussion One of the crucial points of this work is to identify metastability as a distinctive feature of the phase diagram of phosphorus.
In this element, the presence of several discontinuous phase transitions, not directly triggered by phononic instabilities, implies the coexistence of several metastable phases with distinct superconducting properties across the phase diagram.
This means that the initial conditions and the P−T path followed in the experiments largely determine the resulting crystal structure, coexistence of phases and the possibility of observing high-TC metastable phases.
Using high-pressure experiments and ﬁrst-principles calculations we are able to draw a consistent picture of the full phase diagram up to 350 GPa.
We propose that the coexistence of two distinct superconducting phases of phosphorus in the 10–30 GPa pressure window successfully accounts for the the ”anomalous” TCvs.
P trend ﬁrst observed by Kawamura and coworkers5.
Furthermore, we identiﬁed theoretically two other pressure regions in which superconducting TC anomalies could be observed depending on the experimental conditions.
We ﬁrst discuss the 10–30 GPa pressure interval, for which several experimental data are available.
Here, we hypothesize that three phases actually play a role in the superconducting phase diagram, namely black-P, R3m and sc, and that the bifurcation in TC seen by experiments is due to the coexistence the ground-state low-TC A7-P and high-TC metastable black-P phases, which both collapse to scat P ∼20GPa.
Our hypothesis perfectly accounts for the existing literature results of Kawamura etal.
,5, in which the pressure cell was initially loaded with black-P, and pressure was subsequently increased either keeping the system at low temperature (Kawamura Path B in Fig. 1) – or following a room temperature path (Path A and C).
The ﬁrst experimental procedure leads to the highest TC, and is remarkably well reproduced by calculations for black-P, while the second leads to a low TC, and matches the calculated trend for A7 phosphorus.
The two new sets of experiments in this work were explicitly designed to reproduce the distinct TC trends, and to test our interpretation in terms of A7 and black phosphorus.
In contrast to previous experiments, in this work the cell was loaded with red-P at room temperature.
In the ﬁrst set (Exp. 1), the samples were kept at low temperatures during the whole pressure run.
The ﬁrst pressure measured was high enough (∼5 GPa) to ensure a complete transition of red-P to black-P; according to our calculations, the transition should occur at ∼2.5 GPa, and black-P should survive as a metastable phase for pressures well above 20 GPa, where it collapses to the sc.
On the contrary, following the second path in the P−T phase space (Exp. 2), where annealing cycles allow to reach the thermodynamically ground-state structures, will stabilize the A7 phase between 5 and ∼20 GPa.
Upon further compression the A7 structure will transform continuously to sc as our crystal prediction method conﬁrmed.
The measured TC vs. P trends for the two paths closely reproduce the corresponding measurements of Kawamura et al., and are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions, supporting our interpretation that the high-TC phase is metastable black-P. An alternative explanation would be to ascribe the high TC curve in Exp. 1 to a metastable red-P phase.
We can safely rule out this hypothesis because, according to our calculations, after the metalization red-P has a negligible TC (< 1 K).
It is worth to comment the recent measurements by Guo et al.7.
They extend up to 50 GPa, and are generally consistent with previous measurements and ours, but seem to contradict our understanding of the low-pressure range.
In fact, the authors report a gradual increase in TC from 5 to 10 GPa followed by an abrupt jump, which does not have a straightforward interpretation.
Our theoretical results suggest that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is the existence of a mixed black-P–R3m (O+R) phase (suggested by the same authors) which prevents a clear observation of the two distinct TC trends, and is probably responsible for the oscillations in TC observed up to ∼25 GPa, where the samples enter to the sc phase and Guo’s data merge with our measurements and older data.
Besides the low-pressure region already explored by Kawamura etal., we predict two other ranges of pressure in which 5/14different crystal structures are energetically accessible, and experimentally measurable: the ﬁrst is around ∼110 GPa, and a second is above ∼220 GPa.
In the ﬁrst case, unfortunately the two competing phases have very similar critical temperatures (see TC for hex and sc ∼120 GPa), and are thus hard to distinguish experimentally.
Moreover, phonons are softening close to the transition, coming both from low and high pressures, indicating that it could be difﬁcult to stabilize metastable structures and that complex disordered or modulated structures may form50.
In the second case, the TC’s of the ground-state and metastable structures (which according to our predictions is of comparable energetics at the relevant pressures) differ by a factor of three (see Fig. 3 and TC’s for sh, bcc and I −43d above ∼225 GPa).
Therefore, these two distinct TC vs. P trends should be easily discernible by experiments.
However, no superconductivity measurements have been reported yet at these pressures, which was indeed unaccessible also for our current experimental setup.
Nevertheless we note that, remarkably, our theoretical prediction of phase coexistence is consistent with recent XRD experiments37.
A possible path to achieve the synthesis of these metastable phases would be to start from the ground state structure at high pressures I −43d (≲270 GPa), cycle the sample trough temperatures high enough to overcome the energetic barrier to the sh phase, and then cool the sample slowly releasing the pressure down to 230 GPa.
In summary, we have conducted a systematic theoretical and experimental investigation of elemental phosphorous under pressure.
We have shown an excellent agreement between our experimental and theoretical results, which allow us not only to reconcile previous unexplained observed anomalies, but also to shed light onto the complex behavior of this element, which has the tendency to form many polymorphs and that differ substantially in their electronic and superconducting properties and can coexist in metastable forms in different pressure ranges.
A similar behavior has been reported in a wide variety of conventional superconductors51, including simple elements52.
The selective stabilization of metastable phases may represent, in the future, a viable strategy to improve the superconducting properties of conventional superconductors.
For this, it is essential to assess the relative accuracy of experiments and calculations in this respect.
Methods Crystal phase diagram exploration To sample the enthalpy landscape we employed the minima hopping method (MHM)53 with unit cells of up to 8 atoms for selected pressures in the range of 0 to 350 GPa.
This method has been successfully used for global geometry optimization in a large variety of applications54–58, including superconducting materials at high pressure56.
The MHM was designed to thoroughly scan the low-lying enthalpy landscape of any compound and identify stable phases by performing consecutive short molecular dynamics escape steps followed by local geometry relaxations.
The enthalpy surface is mapped out efﬁciently by aligning the initial molecular dynamics velocities approximately along soft-mode directions59,60, thus exploiting the Bell-Evans-Polanyi61 principle to steer the search towards low energy structures.
Energy, atomic forces and stresses were evaluated at the density functional theory (DFT) level with the Perdew-Burke-Erzernhof (PBE)62 parametrization to the exchange-correlation functional.
A plane wave basis-set with a high cutoff energy of 1000 eV was used to expand the wave-function together with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package VASP63.
Geometry relaxations were performed with tight convergence criteria such that the forces on the atoms were less than 2 meV/ ˚A and the stresses were less than 0.1 eV/ ˚A3.
We have reproduced all the experimentally-known phases of P and other low-lying phases, except for white-P and red-P, for which larger supercell calculations are necessary to describe the structure.
Coupling and superconductivity calculations All superconductivity calculations are performed within Density Functional Theory for Superconductors (SCDFT)64,65.
The approximation used have been described in previous works14,18,47,66,67.
The pairing mechanism is due to the combined effect of electron-phonon coupling within DFT Kohn-Sham theory68 as implemented in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO code, and electronic screening computed in the static random-phase-approximation69.
This allows us to calculate TC completely ab-initio, without introducing any empirical parameter, such as the µ∗Coulomb pseudopotential usually used so solve the Eliashberg equations.
Still, we can estimate an effective µ∗(reported in the Supplemental Material), ﬁtting the fully ab-initio TC with the Allen-Dynes-McMillan formula70.
The electron-phonon coupling at the Fermi energy is described in the isotropic approximation by the Eliashberg spectral functions48, deﬁned as: α2F(ω) = 1 NEF ∑ kq,ν |gk,k+q,ν|2δ(εk)δ(εk+q)δ(ω −ωq,ν) , (1) where NEF is the DOS at the Fermi level, ωq,ν is the phonon frequency of mode ν at wavevector q and |gk,k+q,ν| is the electron-phonon matrix element between two electronic states with momenta k and k+q.
All computed α2F(ω) are collected in Fig. 4. Anisotropy effects have been estimated to be irrelevant in the calculation of TC and are neglected in this work.
Two 6/14signiﬁcant moments of the Eliashberg function λ and ωlog, deﬁned as: λ = 2 Z α2F (ω) ω dω (2) ωlog = exp  2 λ Z α2F (ω) ln(ω) ω dω  (3) express, respectively, the electron-phonon coupling and the effective phononic energy.
Core atomic states are described in the norm-conserving pseudo-potential approximation; valence state are described by a plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off 80 Ry.
Since convergence checks have been performed independently on each phase, Brillouin zone integration is done with different sets of k-points in each crystalline structure, ranging from a minimum of 500 k-point per unit reciprocal volume (Bohr3) up to about 3,000 k-points per unit volume for electronic integration and about one fourth of this density for phononic sampling.
The strict convergence criteria ensure that the numerical error in the solution of the SCDFT equations is small as compared to the intrinsic error-bar on the available functionals.
Experimental procedure High pressure electrical measurements were carried out using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) with an anvil tip diameter of 200–300 mm bevelled at 7–8 degrees and with culet surface between 40–80 mm.
Four Ti electrodes were sputtered on the diamond anvil for the ﬁrst experiment (Exp. 1) and three Ti electrodes for the second experiment (Exp. 2).
The electrodes were capped with Au to prevent oxidation of the Ti (a zero contribution by the diamond surface to the conductivity was checked).
An insulating gasket of Teﬂon was used to separate the metallic gasket from the electrodes.
Red phosphorous was loaded in the DAC at ambient temperature and clamped at these conditions.
The ﬁrst pressure point after clamped was already about 3–5 GPa in both experiments.
Then, the DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to measure the ﬁrst point of TC at 13 GPa for the ﬁrst experiment (Exp. 1) and 11 GPa for the second experiment (Exp. 2).
The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale at low temperatures using Raman spectra and we monitored any possible Raman signal from the samples.
We used the 632.8 nm line of a He–Ne laser to excite the Raman spectra measured with a Raman spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD and notch ﬁlters with resolution better than 2 cm−1.
Two different conditions were tested in our experiments, Exp. 1 and Exp.
2 as summarized in Fig. 2, with the only difference being the increased temperature at the beginning of the experiment.
All the resistance measurements were done in increasing pressure; we could not perform measurements under decompression due to the diamond culet crack. References 1.
