The findings showcase how  epitaxial strain can effectively manipulate the antiferromagnetic states in frustrated  antiferromagnets by controlling single-site anisotropy. 1.
Introduction In materials with magnetic atoms sitting in geometrically frustrated lattices, multiple  ordered states exhibiting distinct symmetries can possess comparable energies related to inter- site antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange interactions.
The concept of geometric frustration  frequently intersects with broader notions in condensed matter physics encompassing quantum  spin liquids, topological states, and critical behaviour [1-3].
Over recent decades, the deliberate  manipulation of magnetic states in collinear antiferromagnets has garnered considerable  attention, primarily driven by advancements in AFM spintronics [4,5].
Hence, research efforts  have been directed towards the controlled manipulation of antiferromagnets using diverse  methods, including electrical means [6-8], structural alterations [9-11], high magnetic fields [12], and interaction with neighbouring ferromagnetic layers [13].
Frustrated antiferromagnets, while inherently fascinating [14], have yet to gain practical  significance.
Exploring ways to control single-site anisotropy in these materials, possibly  through strain engineering, could boost their practical applications.
To illustrate the principle  of switching between antiferromagnetic states of different symmetries in frustrated magnets,  we utilize uranium dioxide (UO2), a principal nuclear fuel material, as a model system.
In UO2's  face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, magnetic frustration arises from the energy degeneracy of three  antiferromagnetic states (Fig. 1a(bottom)), influenced by relativistic inter-site AFM exchange  interactions [15].
The nature of UO2's magnetic ground state has puzzled scientists for decades [16].
Initial neutron diffraction measurements in the 1960s suggested a collinear 1k  antiferromagnetic [17,18] structure (Fig. 1a(top)) below the first-order transition at the Néel  temperature TN = 30.8 K. In the 1970s, the occurrence of a dynamical Jahn-Teller (J-T)  distortion above the phase transition temperature was proposed [19].
Subsequent neutron  diffraction studies unveiled the condensation of a static J-T distortion at TN, hinting at a  noncollinear 2k AFM order in UO2 [20,21].
Eventually [22], the exotic transverse 3k magnetic  ordering, a superposition of three individual 1k structures in the cubic unit cell, with uranium  magnetic moments of approximately 1.74(2) μB pointing in the <111> directions (Fig.  1a(bottom)) was revealed.
Resonant x-ray scattering experiments further provided evidence [23] of long-range antiferro-ordering of electric-quadrupole moments at the uranium site.
The ground state triplet of the U4+ ion in the cubic crystal field of UO2 is spherically  symmetric, resulting in exactly zero single-ion anisotropy in the cubic phase [15].
The energy  degeneracy between the states within the fcc lattice is lifted [24,25] by higher rank inter-site  exchange interactions of relativistic origin that couple quadrupole moments and stabilize [24]  the 3k order in cubic UO2.
Here, we demonstrate that an effective switching between the AFM  states of different symmetries can be achieved by stretching the lattice of UO2 and inducing  strong single-ion anisotropy.
In UO2 thin films strain can induce ferromagnetism by incorporating point defects and  generating hypo- (x < 0) or hyper- (x > 0) stoichiometric UO2+x [26].
In this study, we apply  epitaxial strain through substrate selection and switch between antiferromagnetic structures in  stoichiometric UO2 films.
Identifying the exact type of antiferromagnetic ordering in UO2 films  is challenging.
Conventional laboratory macroscopic magnetometry probes are unsuitable due  to insensitivity of antiferromagnets to external magnetic fields, whereas neutron diffraction  requires larger volume of material.
Instead, we utilize the exchange-bias (EB) [27] effect’s  amplitude  in UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers to indirectly probe the antiferromagnetic state in UO2.
The  EB amplitude significantly varies depending on the substrate used for growing the UO2/Fe3O4  bilayers.
Employing many-body first-principles calculations based on charge self-consistent  DFT+Hubbard-I (HI) approximation [28-30] and a force-theorem-HI (FT-HI) approach [31]  for inter-site exchange, we predict that tetragonal distortion leads to a transition in UO2 from  transverse 3k magnetic order to transverse 1k magnetic order.
The experimental observation of  exchange bias in the bilayers UO2/Fe3O4 supports the notion that epitaxial strain serves as a  crucial control parameter in determining the UO2’s antiferromagnetic structure.    2. Results and discussion  1.
Structural and magnetic characterization of thin films  We have previously observed [32] a significant exchange bias effect (EB) in LAO-based  UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers when they were field-cooled below the Néel temperature of UO2.
The EB  arises from the interfacial exchange coupling between the antiferromagnetic UO2 and the  ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, leading to a shift in the magnetic hysteresis loop.
While exchange bias is  typically attributed to interface phenomena, previous studies have indicated [33] that the  mechanisms behind EB, which are not yet fully understood, can also be influenced by the spin  configurations of the bulk antiferromagnetic material.
In our current study, we utilized this  property to investigate the dependence of EB on the thickness of UO2 while introducing the  strain in UO2.For the samples preparation we have chosen the substrates due to the following  considerations.
UO2 has a lattice constant a0 of 5.469 Å at room temperature.
CaF2 is  isostructural to UO2 with lattice parameter a0 = 5.462 Å (lattice mismatch of 0.1%).
For the  (001) LaAlO3 substrates with lattice parameter a0 = 3.821 Å, the epitaxial relationship with UO2  would be such that the (110) plane of UO2 (d-spacing a0/√2 = 3.867 Å) fits with the LaAlO3  (100) plane, thus producing a small compression of UO2 of −1.2% with respect to the substrate  in-plane spacing.
Indeed, a XRD study confirmed that the UO2 layers grow in the [100]  direction on both types of substrates, CaF2 (100) and LaAlO3 (001).
Bulk magnetite Fe3O4 (fcc  structure with space group Fd3m) has a lattice parameter of 8.39 Å. We find that Fe3O4 grows  on UO2 with an [111]-out-of plane orientation (Fig. 1(b)).
Figures 1 (c) and (d) demonstrate the  stacking sequence for the UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers on substrates (100) CaF2 and (001) LaAlO3,  respectively (the hexagonal Mg capping layer with basal planes parallel to the surface is not  shown).

Only Bragg  reflections CaF2 h00, UO2 h00, Fe3O4 hhh and Mg 000l are visible revealing the lattice  orientation for all layers.
(c), (d) Epitaxial relationship found in the magnetic bilayers  (111)Fe3O4||(001)UO2||(001)LAO and (111)Fe3O4||(001)UO2||(001)CaF2, respectively (for details see  Figs. S4, S5 and S9, Supporting information).
Magnetic hysteresis loops for both series of samples were measured after field cooling  through the Néel temperature of UO2 in a 10 kOe magnetic field applied in the in-plane direction  of the bilayers (Fig. 2(a)).
We determined the exchange bias effect as HEB = |(|HC−| − HC+)|/2,  where HC−(HC+) is the coercive field on the descending (ascending) branch of the hysteresis  loop.
The exchange bias reaches 2000 Oe in the CaF2-based system.
Surprisingly, we find that  the LAO-based samples demonstrate a twice weaker EB as compared to the CaF2-based bilayers  at all thicknesses of UO2 (Fig. 2(b)).
Given that the strength of exchange coupling in the  exchange-biased system is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ferro- (or ferrimagnetic  in our case) magnetic counterpart of the bilayers as HEB~1/τF [27], the fact that in both systems  the Fe3O4 layers possess similar thicknesses and have identical structural characteristics (as  detailed in Figs. S4, S5, Supporting information) fails to account for the observed twofold  difference in the EB magnitude.     Fig. 2. (a) Comparison of the H-M magnetization loops at 5 K for the UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers on  different substrates after field cooling in the 10 kOe field.
For UO2 and Fe3O4 the thicknesses  are 271 and 282 Å (CaF2 substrate) and 285 and 276 Å (LAO substrate), respectively.
Data for  a single layer of Fe3O4 (270 Å) (broken line) is shown for comparison.
(b) Dependence of  exchange bias field on the thickness of the antiferromagnetic layer UO2 in the UO2/Fe3O4  bilayers.
The thickness of the ferromagnetic counterpart of the bilayer, Fe3O4, is kept constantin both series of the samples deposited on CaF2 and LaAlO3 substrates.
The broken lines are a  guide to the eye.
Another factor that could potentially explain the difference lies in the presence of  distinct variations in the stoichiometry of the UO2 layer and/or the morphology of the  UO2/Fe3O4 interface.
The former was shown [26] to be responsible for ferromagnetism in the  UO2+x thin films by incorporating point defects.
Hence, the stoichiometry of the UO2 layers was  closely monitored after depositing each layer.
In particular, we controlled the position and width  of the main U-4f peaks and high-energy side satellite line relative to an associated primary U- 4f5/2 peak (Fig. S1, Supporting information).
This approach is independent of the absolute  binding energy and is particularly useful for distinguishing the oxidation states of uranium [34].
Additionally, we ensured the absence of any foreign structures in the XPS spectra.
The observed  values for UO2 were in line with literature [34] for both types of substrates.
(As a point of  comparison: in the case of hyperstoichiometric UO2+x thin film samples investigated in Ref.
[26], the associated photoemission study documented in Ref.
[35] indicated that the satellite  peaks are scarcely visible.) The quality of the interface was assessed using Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry  (RBS); the recorded well-separated spectra from U and Fe revealed no chemical intermixing  between the magnetic layers within experimental resolution (Fig. S4, Supporting information).
The sharpness of the interface between the UO2 layer and the substrates was further validated  by the presence of distinct thickness fringes observed around the UO2 peaks in the XRD data  (Fig. 1b and Fig. S7, Supporting information).
These observations are entirely consistent with  the findings from our previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of the LAO- based UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers [32].
To provide a more in-depth characterization of the UO2/Fe3O4 samples' crystal structure,   we recorded Reciprocal Space Maps in the vicinity of characteristic symmetric and asymmetric  peaks of UO2 on both types of substrates (see Fig. 3).
The simulated lattice parameters of the  UO2 layer are given in Fig. 4.
Our results reveal a negligible lateral strain in the UO2  homogeneous epitaxial layer when deposited on CaF2.
The UO2 layer on the LAO substrate is  in-plane compressively strained.
The substrate-induced tetragonality or strain of UO2 (with its  measure depicted in the upper part of Fig. 4) decreases with the increasing layer thickness and  approaches a certain residual value given by different thermal expansions of the substrate and  the layer during the post-growth cooling.
This is consistent with data obtained by Bao et al. [36]  who employed resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) to study UO2 thin films deposited on the LAOand CaF2 substrates and observed strain-induced tetragonal distortion with a mosaicity of ~1º  in the LAO-based UO2 films.
For the record, in some of the CaF2-based layers, we also observed a noticeable  tetragonal distortion, most likely induced during the cooling process after film deposition.
The  exchange bias in these samples immediately decreased to values similar to those observed in  the LAO-based system (Fig. S10, Supporting information).
On the other hand, in one of the  CaF2-based samples, we noticed a significantly smaller lattice parameter of UO2 with τAF = 85  Å (Fig. 4), probably due to a slight oxygen deficiency in the sample.
However, the UO2 layer  in this sample remained cubic, and the resulting exchange bias was found to be of similar  magnitude, around 2000 Oe, as in the stoichiometric samples.
This aligns with the general  understanding of the robustness of antiferromagnetism in bulk UO2: bulk off-stoichiometric  UO2±x remain antiferromagnetic for small deviations of x < 0.07 [37,38].    Fig. 4.

The experimental diffraction curve (magenta solid line) was extracted as a vertical  cut passing through the UO2 Bragg reflection and then fitted by a numerical simulation based  on the kinematic theory of diffraction for determination of the out-of-plane lattice parameterand the thicknesses for the CaF2-based UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers capped with Mg.

The solid line is the lattice parameter of bulk cubic  UO2.
The upper panel shows the strain-induced degree of tetragonality of the films determined  as (c−a)/((c + a)/2).
Below, we show by first-principles calculations that even a slight tetragonal distortion  of the initial fcc structure can induce a single-ion anisotropy in strained UO2.
Consequently, the  altered arrangement of moments within the film's bulk and at the interface could account for  the discrepancy in observed exchange bias magnitudes between the two systems. 2.
Magnetic structure of the tetragonally distorted UO2  The principal possibility for a magnetic structure switching in tetragonally distorted UO2  stems from the frustration between various antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in its bulk magnetic  structure, as explained in the introduction.
The resolution of this frustration in cubic UO2 (Fig.  1(a)) cannot be ascribed to the single-ion magnetic anisotropy (SIA) since the ground state of  U4+ ion in a cubic environment is a completely isotropic triplet [15].
Recent first-principles  calculations [24,25] employing a correlated treatment of the 5f-electron shell have shown thata small energy difference between 1k, 2k and 3k ordering is due to high-rank quadrupole- quadrupole interactions. In particular, Ref.
24 employs the DFT+HI method together with the  FT-HI approach to derive the full super-exchange Hamiltonian of UO2.
This work showed that  the experimental 3k is stabilized with respect to the competing structures by quadrupole- quadrupole super-exchange interactions (SEI).
In the case of tetragonally distorted UO2, the SEI Hamiltonian needs to be supplemented  by a SIA term:                             (1)  where HSEI and HSIA are the SEI and SIA contributions, respectively.
The former is split  between the dipole-dipole (DD) and quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ) terms acting within the  ground-state (GS)  Γ5 triplet of U4+ ion as defined in Ref. 23.
The tetragonal crystal field (CF)  splits the GS triplet inducing the SIA.
We employ ab initio 𝐻𝐻𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 and HSIA, please see Method  Section for details of our theoretical approach.

The temperature is related to the theoretical mean-field bulk TN = 56 K. (Right)  Schematic representation of various directions of magnetic moments of UO2 and Fe3O4 and  the corresponding angles between the moments.
For the distortion level of the LAO-based layer (ε = c/a – 1 = 2.5 %), we obtained the  value of 210 meV for the overall crystal field (CF) splitting of the U4+ atomic multiplet 3H4.
This value is very close to our previously obtained value of 207 meV for the cubic case [24]  and is in good agreement with experimental estimates [15].
The Γ5 triplet ground state is split  by the tetragonal elongation into a doublet ground state and an excited singlet.
This splitting is  linear with ε and reaches 2.78 meV for the LAO-based layer.
Introducing the pseudo-angular  momentum J = 1 to label the Γ5 eigenstates as specified in Ref.
24, one may write the SIA termat a given U site as HSIA = D Jz2.
The anisotropy constant D = Cε is linear vs. the distortion,  with the pre-factor C = -113 meV extracted from DFT+HI calculations.
We then solved the calculated ab initio magnetic Hamiltonian (1) as a function of the  tetragonal elongation ε and temperature within the mean-field (MF) approximation [39].
The  resulting phase diagram is depicted in Fig. 5.
Cubic UO2 is predicted to order into the transverse  3k AFM structure shown in Fig. 1(a) at the theoretical TNbulk = 56 K, the overestimation as  compared to the experimental value of 30 K is due to the MF approximation [24].
This structure  remains stable at small tetragonal distortions, however, the moment amplitude along the out- of-plane z direction increases with ε due to the SIA effect.
The ordered moment at U site R is  given 𝑀𝑀𝑹𝑹= ൣ𝑀𝑀||exp(−𝑖𝑖𝒌𝒌𝑧𝑧𝑹𝑹), 𝑀𝑀||exp(−𝑖𝑖𝒌𝒌𝑥𝑥𝑹𝑹), 𝑀𝑀⊥exp(−𝑖𝑖𝒌𝒌𝑦𝑦𝑹𝑹)൧, where  𝑀𝑀|| and 𝑀𝑀⊥ are the  amplitude of the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the moment, respectively,  𝑀𝑀|| < 𝑀𝑀⊥,    and kx,y,z are propagation vectors in the corresponding directions.
At the transition point  between the two structures the in-plane amplitude 𝑀𝑀|| becomes 0, thus the structure collapses  into the transverse 1k one (also depicted in Fig. 1(a)) with the out-of-plane moment direction.
We note that the actual distortion level for CaF2-based films is very close to the 1k→3k  transition boundary.
Provided the sensitivity of this boundary to the calculational details and  experimental conditions, the CaF2-based layers can still be considered to be in the 3k domain,  while the LAO layers are firmly situated within the 1k region.
3. Discussion  Based on our first principles calculations, one may intuitively expect that different  mutual arrangements of magnetic moments of cubic and tetragonally distorted UO2 and Fe3O4  would give different EB values since the interface exchange interaction creating the EB pinning  would also essentially change.
The situation is illustrated in a simple cartoon in Fig. 5(left).
If  the magnetic structure of UO2 remains 3k in the CaF2-based thin films, the magnetic moments  of UO2 lying in one of the three equivalent <111> directions couple with the magnetic moment  of Fe3O4 lying along the <100> directions.
The angle between the moments directions is 12.24°.
In this case, we observe the maximum EB effect in the CaF2-based samples.
If switching to  another AFM state occurs upon straining the lattice of UO2, then the coupling strength and  hence the magnitude of EB essentially change.
Our calculations predict stabilization of a 1k- AFM structure (Fig. 5) in the distorted crystal structure, hence the orientation of magnetization  of the AFM sublattices would then lie in the [001] direction.
In this case, coupling with the  moment of Fe3O4 occurs at the angle 54.74°, resulting in the drastic reduction of EB for the  LAO-based samples.
In general, it is assumed that the bulk spin configuration of a material is maintained even  at the interface.
However, real exchange-biased systems are much more complex than simple  models.
The orientation of interfacial spins can be influenced by various factors, such as  structural properties like crystallinity and morphology, which often manifest themselves very  differently for various material combinations.
As a result, the interfacial spin orientations in  such systems can be more intricate and difficult to predict.
For the LAO-based samples, in  addition to reduced exchange interaction due to differently oriented moments of the bulk UO2  layer, larger mosaicity [36] of the strained UO2 layer may also contribute to the decreased HEB.
It is worth noting that tetragonal deformation appearing as the result of compression of  UO2 deposited on a LAO substrate in Ref.
36 was shown to promote a formation of a  magnetically “dead” layer close to the substrate.
The exact nature of the “dead” layer was not  determined in the RXS experiment, but the evidence was such it did not have the  antiferromagnetic structure of bulk UO2.
As it follows from our combined XRD, XRR  (Supporting information) and RBS studies, the interface between the substrate and the UO2  layer for both types of substrates is well-defined for all UO2 layer thicknesses.
In our UO2/Fe3O4  bilayers, we detect exchange bias in both systems even at the smallest UO2 thicknesses.
For  both types of samples, the EB magnitude and hence, the interfacial interaction and exchange  coupling become less prominent at UO2 thicknesses below 70 Å, which is in line with general  behavior for various exchange-biased systems [40].
The peculiar feature of our samples is that  EB never falls to zero completely.
It is related to the presence of non-zero exchange bias in the  magnetite layer [32].
From studying the control samples of single Fe3O4 layers shown in Fig.  2(a) with identical structure and similar thicknesses to that of bilayers, we find that a certain  part of the effect (~15% at 5 K in the CaF2-based samples) is naturally coming from magnetite  alone.
We emphasize that the saturation magnetization in the single Fe3O4 layers and in the  bilayers is essentially the same.
(Low-temperature magnetic moment of about 440 emu/cc is  found for both types of films, which is slightly lower than the saturation magnetization value  of 480 emu/cc of bulk magnetite [41].) Importantly, the magnitude of exchange bias in our  UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers on both types of substrates always remains significantly larger than that of  a single magnetite layer of similar thickness.
3. Conclusion  The exchange bias magnitude in the stoichiometric, homogeneous UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers  depends on the type of substrate used.
In case of small tetragonal distortion in the LAO-based  UO2 layers, the EB in bilayers is significantly reduced as compared to the CaF2-based samples.
By first principles calculations we show that the reason dwells in the change ofantiferromagnetic structure as a result of distortion.
UO2 films with a cubic CaF2 structure are  very close to the border of 3k-1k transition and strain imposed by the substrate pushes UO2  toward the 1k antiferromagnetic structure.
Our study reveals a prospect of switching frustrated  magnets for potential applications.
For instance, by pairing UO2 with a soft ferromagnet  (permalloy, Py) we were able to induce perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the Py layer  through the canted moments of a CaF2-based UO2 [42].
The effect might be greater with a LAO- based UO2, where the direction of UO2 and Py moments would coincide.
The inherent ability  to manipulate the magnetic alignment in frustrated magnets opens avenues for tailoring device  functionalities to specific requirements.
4.  Method Section  Experiment  The UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers were synthesized by reactive (-gas) dc sputtering realized in a  home-built setup, using a miniature U (natural uranium, 99.9 wt.% purity) and Fe (99.99%  purity) targets and an electron emitting thoriated tungsten filament stabilizing the plasma [43].
Different epitaxial strain states in the UO2 layer were realized by employing different substrates.
The thickness of the UO2 layer varied across the samples series, with the minimal thickness of  17 Å on the CaF2 substrate and with the maximum of 340 Å on SiO2.
In contrast, the thickness  of the Fe3O4 layer in the bilayers was maintained at approximately 270 ± 20 Å. Prior to the  growth, the commercially available substrates CaF2 (100), LaAlO3 (001) and fused silica SiO2  (MTI Corp.) (the results for the latter are shown in Figs. S9 and S10, Supporting information)  were annealed in dynamic vacuum at temperatures used for UO2 deposition as shown below.
The UO2 layer was always deposited onto the substrates at elevated temperature of 350 ºC for  CaF2 and SiO2 substrates and at 500 ºC for the LAO substrate, using a partial oxygen pressure  of 1.2×10-6 mbar (Ar pressure of 6×10-3 mbar).
We specifically restricted the deposition  temperature for the UO2 layers to 500 ºC for LAO substrates to avoid passing through the  ferroelastic transition that occurs at 560 ºC in this substrate.
As for the CaF2 substrates, we have  chosen even lower deposition temperatures to avoid cracking of the substrate when cooling  from growth temperature to ambient conditions.
The layer of Fe3O4 was deposited on the top of UO2 at room temperature to avoid  interdiffusion and at 6-7×10-7 mbar oxygen pressure (Ar pressure of 1-3×10-2 mbar).
The  stoichiometry of each deposited layer was controlled in situ by X-ray Photoelectron  Spectroscopy (XPS) using a MgKα (photon energy 1253.6eV) source.
After that, a magnesium  cap was deposited for protection on top of each sample.
For the sake of comparison ofproperties, we also prepared 270-Å thick single Fe3O4 layers on the same substrates and capped  them with Mg, too.
The films’ structure was characterized by several methods.
We used Rutherford  Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) in the channeling mode (RBS-C) using a beam of 2-MeV  He+ ions to check the single-crystalline layer structure and to determine the sharpness of the  interface between the magnetic layers.
RBS-C measurements were carried out on a Tandetron  MC 4130 accelerator at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Řež  near Prague.
For RBS-C analysis, the crystal target was mounted onto a two-axis goniometer  with an angular resolution of 0.01°.
A surface-barrier Si detector with a circular aperture of 5.4  mm in diameter was placed at a distance of 70 mm from the sample holder at the scattering  angle of 170°.
The energy resolution of the detector was about 12 keV.
The accessible  information depth provided by 2-MeV He+ ion beam is about ∼1.5 μm in this geometry.
The  spectra were evaluated with the software SIMNRA 6.06 [44].
The x-ray reflectometry (XRR) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were  performed with Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer equipped with a 9kW rotating anode.
The  primary beam was monochromatized and parallelized by a parabolic x-ray mirror and a 2- bounce Ge(220) monochromator.
Reflectivity curves (Fig. S6, Supporting information) and  XRD θ-2θ scans were measured with two receiving slits in front of the detector and the XRD  reciprocal space map (RSM) measurements were performed with a HyPix-3000 in the 1D mode  (medium resolution).
From the XRR data we determined the thickness of individual layers and  roughness of the corresponding interfaces.
Lattice parameters and a relaxation state of the UO2  layers was found using RSM measurements allowing us to obtain an out-of-plane lattice  parameter and the thickness of the single crystal layers, with precise values determined by  simulation based on the kinematic theory of diffraction.
The magnetization studies were conducted using a vibrating sample magnetometer on  the Quantum Design PPMS9 platform (Quantum Design).
The magnetic field was applied along  the sample surface.
Theory We employ the same SEI as calculated in Ref.
24 for cubic UO2, thus neglecting the  effect of tetragonal distortions on their magnitude, which is likely unimportant provided the  rather small distortion magnitude.
In order to evaluate the SIA term, we calculate the splitting  of the GS triplet in UO2 versus the magnitude of tetragonal distortions by means of the self- consistent DFT+Hubbard-I (HI) approximation [28-30] using the same calculational  parameters as in Ref. 24.
Namely, we employ U = 4.5 eV and Hund's rule coupling JH = 0.6eV to specify a rotationally invariant on-site Coulomb repulsion on the U 5f shell, the fully- localized limit double-counting term for the nominal atomic occupancy of 2 of the U4+ 5f shell.
3000 k-points were employed in the Brillouin zone integration and the LAPW basis cutoff [29]  RMT⋅KMAX = 7.
We adjusted the out-of-plane lattice parameter c so as to keep the cell volume  fixed at its bulk value.
