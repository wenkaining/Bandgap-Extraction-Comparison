Link between the Superconducting Dome and Spin-Orbit Interaction in the (111) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 Interface P. K. Rout, E. Maniv, and Y. Dagan Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel (Dated: September 20, 2018) We measure the gate voltage (Vg) dependence of the superconducting properties and the spin- orbit interaction in the (111)-oriented LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.
Superconductivity is observed in a dome-shaped region in the carrier density-temperature phase diagram with the maxima of superconducting transition temperature Tc and the upper critical ﬁelds lying at the same Vg.
The spin-orbit interaction determined from the superconducting parameters and conﬁrmed by weak- antilocalization measurements follows the same gate voltage dependence as Tc.
The correlation between the superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction as well as the enhancement of the parallel upper critical ﬁeld, well beyond the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit suggest that superconductivity and the spin-orbit interaction are linked in a nontrivial fashion.
We propose possible scenarios to explain this unconventional behavior.
Oxide heterostructures provide unique platform where various degrees of freedom from the constituent ma- terials can combine such that new collective phe- nomena emerge at the interfaces [1].
An interest- ing example is a two-dimensional (2D) electron liquid at the interface between (100)-oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 that exhibits gate tunable superconductivity [2– 4] and spin-orbit interaction [4–6].
Recent experiments on (111) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 have shown 2D conduction [7–9] and superconductivity with a transition tempera- ture (Tc) of about 100 mK [10, 11].
In a (111)-oriented LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, the cubic lattice is projected onto the (111) plane of the interface, resulting in a 2D sixfold crystalline structure.
Angle-resolved photoemis- sion studies on the (111) SrTiO3 surface reveal a sixfold symmetric electronic structure [12, 13].
This 2D crys- talline symmetry is also reﬂected in the magnetotrans- port properties [9] and has been predicted to host exotic electronic orders [14–17].
At low temperatures, this sym- metry is lowered, since bulk SrTiO3 undergoes multiple structural transitions.
Below 105 K, a transition from a cubic to a tetragonal phase occurs [18].
The symme- try is further reduced to triclinic below ∼70 K, and po- lar domain walls where inversion symmetry is broken are created [19].
Such a domain wall can be pinned to the interface, resulting in unconventional superconductivity, which is linked to spin-orbit coupling.
In a 2D superconductor, for a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular to the superconducting plane, supercon- ductivity is broken when vortices become closely packed.
By contrast, the parallel upper critical ﬁeld (Hc∥) is de- termined by the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit [20, 21], which is set by comparing the Zeeman energy to the su- perconducting gap.
In the presence of a spin-orbit inter- action, this upper bound is relaxed [22, 23].
In this Letter, we report a nonmonotonic (dome- shaped) dependence of Tc with a gate voltage in the (111) SrTiO3/LaAlO3 interfaces.
From the gate depen- dence of Tc and Hc∥, we estimate the spin-orbit energy (εSO), which follows the nonmonotonic behavior of Tc.

Epitaxial ﬁlms of LaAlO3 were deposited on an atom- ically ﬂat SrTiO3 (111) substrate using pulsed laser de- position.
The details of the deposition procedure and substrate treatment are described in Ref. [9].
We con- trol the layer-by-layer growth of 14 monolayers (LaO3/Al layers) by reﬂection high-energy electron diﬀraction os- cillations.
The atomic force microscope images show the step and terrace morphology of the ﬁlm with step heights of 0.22 nm.
The electrical measurements with the cur- rent along the [11¯2] direction were carried out in a Leiden Cryogenics custom-made dilution refrigerator.
Figure 1 (a) presents the temperature-dependent sheet resistance RS (T) at various gate voltages Vg.
A clear gate-dependent superconducting transition is observed.
We deﬁne the critical temperature Tc as the tempera- ture at which RS reaches half of its value at 350 mK. The arXiv:1706.01717v3 [cond-mat.supr-con]  4 Dec 20172 normal state resistance RS (350 mK) decreases mono- tonically with increasing Vg [Fig. 1 (b)], which is con- sistent with previous reports [8, 9].
The monotonic in- crease of RS is contrasted with the nonmonotonic de- pendence of Tc on Vg.
A similar dome-shaped region in the carrier density-temperature phase diagram is seen in many unconventional superconductors and in the (100) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.
In the (100) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, the Hall co- eﬃcient depends nonmonotonically on the gate voltage.
Surprisingly, this nonmonotonic behavior is also seen in the gate dependence of the Shubnikovde Haas oscilla- tions (SdH) frequency.
Both the SdH frequency and low ﬁeld inverse Hall coeﬃcient follow the gate dependence of Tc for the (100) interface [3, 24], or the superconduc- tivity starts appearing when the low ﬁeld inverse Hall coeﬃcient decreases from its maximum value [25].
By contrast, for the (111) interface the inverse Hall coeﬃ- cient monotonically decreases with Vg [Fig. 1 (c)] con- sistent with previous observations [8, 9].
In the case of the (111) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, the titanium t2g bands are split into low and high spin states due to the atomic spin-orbit interaction [14, 15].
We have shown that the lower spin state is ﬁrst populated when accu- mulating electrons with increasing Vg [9].
This two-band scenario complicates the interpretation of the Hall data.
We have estimated the amount of carrier density modula- tion due to the electric ﬁeld eﬀect similar to Refs. [2, 26].
Since the Vg range used is relatively small, the nonlinear- ities in the dielectric constant (ϵ) can be neglected and thus the corresponding modulation of electron density is ≃1.3 × 1013 cm−2 with ϵ ≃15000.
This value is much smaller than the net change in 1/|eRH| of ≃4.3 × 1013 cm−2.
Moreover, the electron density due to the ﬁeld eﬀect increases with Vg in contrast to the observed be- havior in Fig. 1 (c).
All these observations indicate the presence of a hole band in addition to electron band(s) in the (111) interface.
We have conﬁrmed this scenario by analyzing the normal state transport data via a simplis- tic noninteracting two-band model with one hole and one electron band (see Ref.
[27] for more details).
Therefore, it is possible that the hole contribution to the electronic transport (and perhaps to superconductivity) becomes important in this Vg range [8].
This is also consistent with the polar structure of the (111) interface [7].
The sheet resistance versus magnetic ﬁeld at 90 mK for various gate voltages is plotted in Figs. 2 (a) and 2 (b) for perpendicular and parallel ﬁeld conﬁgurations, where the sample is properly aligned with the ﬁeld within an accuracy of 2◦.
We deﬁne the critical ﬁeld (Hc⊥) for the perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration such that RS(Hc⊥)= RS (350 mK)/2 and a similar criterion is followed for Hc∥[28].
In Fig. 2 (c) we plot Hc∥ and Hc⊥ as a function of Vg both exhibiting nonmono- tonic behavior with the maximum at the same gate volt- age as Tc. Hc∥>Hc⊥ for all gate voltages reaching a maximal ratio of ∼16.
Such strong anisotropy between two ﬁeld orientations is evidence for 2D superconduc- tivity in the (111) interface.
Thus, it is expected that the superconducting layer thickness (d) should be smaller than the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length (ξGL).
To check this, we extract ξGL from Hc⊥using the relation: ξGL = p Φ0/2πHc⊥.
It is presented in Fig. 2 (d) to- gether with its extrapolation to zero temperature using Hc⊥(T)=Hc⊥(0)(1 −T/Tc) valid for a 2D superconduc- tor.
Since the parallel magnetic ﬁeld fully penetrates a 2D (d ≪ξ) superconductor we can only estimate the up- per limit for d denoted as d, which can be found from d = √ 3Φ0/πξGLHc∥[see Fig. 2 (d)].
We note that, for all Vg, d < ξGL(0), rendering superconductivity in the (111) SrTiO3/LaAlO3 two dimensional.
For a parallel ﬁeld conﬁguration in a 2D supercon- ductor, the orbital motion and vortices can be neglected making the Zeeman energy the dominant pair-breaking eﬀect.
This leads to an upper (Chandrasekhar-Clogston) limit of Hc∥given by HP = 3.5kBTc/ √ 2gµB (µB is the Bohr magneton) in the BCS weak coupling limit [20, 21].
Assuming a gyromagnetic ratio of g ≃2, we observe Hc∥> HP for all gate voltages reaching a maximal ratio of ∼11 [Fig. 2 (c)].
In the presence of strong spin-orbit cou- pling the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit can be relaxed.
Other reasons for breaking this limit could be strong coupling superconductivity, many-body eﬀects, and an anisotropic pairing mechanism.
To determine the spin-orbit interaction from Hc∥, we use a somewhat oversimpliﬁed picture of spin-orbit scat- tering that suppresses spin orientation by the Zeeman ﬁeld [22].
For a strong spin-orbit interaction, Hc∥ can be expressed in terms of the spin-orbit energy (εSO) as Hc∥= 0.602 p εSO/kBTcHP with εSO = ¯h/τSO, and τSO is the spin-orbit scattering time.
Remarkably, this anal- ysis reveals a nonmonotonic dependence of εSO on Vg as shown in Fig. 3 (b).
This is the main ﬁnding of our Let- ter.
For (110) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 , gate-independent spin- orbit coupling has been observed [29]; perhaps because of the nonpolar structure of this interface.
The ﬁndings on the (110) interface are contrasted with our results of a strong and gate-tunable spin-orbit interaction for the (111) interface that follows the behavior of the supercon- ducting dome.
A weaker correlation between spin-orbit coupling and Tc in the (100) interface can be deduced by combining Refs.
[4–6], where Hc∥is smaller.
To further conﬁrm the presence of a spin-orbit inter- action, we studied the perpendicular magnetoresistance well above Tc at 1.3 K [Fig. 3 (a)].

Hi and HSO are the inelastic and spin-orbit ﬁelds, respectively.
The classical orbital magnetoresis- tance contributes a Kohler term to Eq. (1) with the pa- rameters A and C. Figure 3 (c) shows Hi and HSO for diﬀerent Vg (see Supplemental Material for the gate de- pendence of g, A, and C [27]).
Clearly, HSO > Hi for all Vg , suggesting that we are in the weak antilocalization regime [see Fig. 3 (a)].
HSO from weak antilocalization [Fig. 3 (c)] shows nonmonotonic behavior similar to εSO inferred from superconductivity [Fig. 3 (b)], and, further- more, they have maximum value at the same gate voltage as Tc.
In general, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface has a com- plicated band structure involving multiple contributions from the titanium d bands [31, 32].
Therefore, the ex- tracted parameters from weak antilocalization do not cor- respond to an individual band; instead an averaged value over all the bands should be considered [33].
We have extracted various averaged time scales, i. e. τSO, τi (inelastic time), and τ (elastic scattering time) [Fig. 3 (d)].
The τSO(i) are related to HSO(i) determined from weak antilocalization as HSO(i) = ¯h/4eDτSO(i).
The ef- fective diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D) and τ are calculated using a na¨ıve Drude model for a 2D electron gas (see Ref. [27]).
Using this analysis we ﬁnd that τSO depends linearly on τ −1 for Vg < -25 V [see the inset in Fig. 3 (d)] while for Vg > -25 V both τSO and τ increase with Vg [Fig. 3 (d)].
The low Vg regime (Vg < -25 V) is governed by a D’yakonov-Perel’-type spin-orbit relaxation mechanism for which τSO ∝τ −1.
In this scenario the electron pre- cesses around the spin-orbit ﬁeld, which is changing due to momentum scattering at a typical time τ [34].
The high Vg regime, on the other hand, is characterized by τSO ∝τ, suggesting that the electron spin is coupled to the crystal momentum.
Interestingly these two regimes separated by the point where τSO ≃τ and the maximum4 0 2 4 6 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 -45 -30 -15 0 15 30 10 -1 10 0 0 2 4 6 -45 -30 -15 0 15 30 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 0 10 20 0.0 0.3 0.6 (d) (a) (c)  -30 V  -40 V  -50 V  Fit   0  -5 V  -10 V  -15 V  -20 V  -25 V H (T) (b) Hi    Vg (V)   Hi,SO (T) HSO   SO (meV )   SO  i Time scales (ps) Vg (V)     (10 12 s -1) SO (ps) FIG.

All these ob- servations suggest the mixing of multiple bands in the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction for higher Vg.
This scenario concurs with our recent report of crystalline sixfold anisotropic magnetoresistance in the (111) inter- faces [9], where the sixfold term appears as a result of another band with higher spin state J getting populated with increasing Vg.
It is therefore possible that the crys- talline spin-orbit interaction becomes important close to this avoided band crossing region due to the orbital mix- ing [23, 35].
This interaction becomes smaller as Vg is further increased away from the band crossing regime, resulting in a dome in the spin-orbit energy versus Vg.
Such a multiband eﬀect can also lead to dome-shaped superconductivity with maximum Tc lying at this regime [as observed in Fig. 1 (b)] similar to the case for the (100) interface [3].
A more exotic mechanism of superconduc- tivity in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface involves the forma- tion of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) state due to large spin-orbit coupling [36].
This can somewhat explain the nonmonotonic gate dependence of Hc∥and Tc with the maxima lying at τSO = τ.
However, the Hc∥for a quasi-2D superconductor in a FFLO state is estimated to be at most 2.5 times the Chandrasekhar- Clogston limit [37], which is much lower than the ob- served values [see Fig. 2 (c)].
Therefore, a full theoreti- cal understanding of the phenomenological link observed here between the superconducting dome and the spin- orbit energy is yet to be developed.
Salje et al. have found that for SrTiO3 below ∼70 K the tetragonal symmetry is lowered and the Sr atoms are displaced along the [111] direction leading to the breaking of local inversion symmetry [19].
It is there- fore possible that a (111) SrTiO3-based polar interface has such broken inversion symmetry in addition to con- ventional inversion symmetry breaking observed at po- lar oxide interfaces, which can result in an unconven- tional superconductivity.
It has been recently suggested that dichalcogenide monolayers with hexagonal struc- ture can be a realization of exotic Ising superconduc- tivity where the spins are locked in an out-of-plane con- ﬁguration due to the breaking of centrosymmetry [38– 40].
We also note that the possibility for a nodeless time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting order parameter has been proposed for (111) SrTiO3-based in- terfaces from symmetry considerations [16].
In summary, the superconducting transition tempera- ture Tc of the (111) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface has a non- monotonic dependence on the gate voltage.
Maximum Tc is found at the same gate voltage where maximal val- ues of spin-orbit ﬁeld HSO and spin-orbit energy εSO are observed.
HSO is extracted from weak antilocalization while εSO is estimated from the superconducting proper- ties.
The Hc∥exceeds the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit by more than an order of magnitude due to a strong spin- orbit interaction.
We suggest that the crystalline spin-5 orbit interaction becomes important close to an avoided band crossing region.
In this regime orbital mixing can lead to enhanced spin-orbit interaction and superconduc- tivity, which become weaker as Vg is tuned away from this avoided band crossing regime.
This results in a dome in the spin-orbit energy (and Tc ) versus Vg.
However, a deeper insight to the link between spin-orbit interaction and the superconducting dome requires further develop- ment of theoretical models for this unique hexagonal ox- ide interface.

But these two quantities coincide for other gate voltages.

TWO-BAND ANALYSIS OF HALL DATA We have analysed the Hall data (Fig. S1) using a simpliﬁed two band model with no interaction eﬀects.
As discussed in the manuscript, one of them should be a hole band while the other is a electron band.
In this model, the low ﬁeld Hall coeﬃcient is given as: RH = 1 e nhµ2 h −neµ2 e (nhµh + neµe)2 .
(S1) where nh(e) and µh(e) are hole (electron) carrier density and mobility, respectively.
The corresponding sheet resistance at zero magnetic ﬁeld is RS = [e(nhµh + neµe)]−1.
For relatively small Vg range used, the nonlinearities in the dielectric constant can be neglected and the change in total carrier density for change in Vg (∆Vg) can be given as: CST O∆Vg = e(∆nh + ∆ne), where CST O is the capacitance of STO (111) per unit area.
The corresponding changes in nh(e) are proportional to eﬀective masses mh(e) for parabolic bands and therefore ∆nh/∆ne = mh/me.
We have assumed mh = me for our calculations.
Using all these expressions, we have extracted nh(e) and µh(e) [See Fig. S1 (a,b)].

(c) The Hall resistance (Rxy) as a function of magnetic ﬁeld for diﬀerent Vg measured at 5 K. The solid curves are plotted using the extracted nh(e) and µh(e) in Eq. S2.7 Using the extracted nh(e) and µh(e), we have calculated the Hall resistance for high magnetic ﬁelds by the expression: Rxy = 1 e (nhµ2 h −neµ2 e) + µ2 hµ2 e(nh −ne)H2 (nhµh + neµe)2 + µ2 hµ2e(nh −ne)2H2 H. (S2) The calculated Hall curves have good agreement with the measured data for lower ﬁelds [see Fig. S1 (c)].
However, we see more deviation with increasing ﬁeld.
This can be due to more complicated eﬀects such as splitting of the electron band into two spin states with an avoided band crossing due to spin-orbit interaction.
Our simpliﬁed two-band description cannot capture these eﬀects.
We want to point out that, in order to perform a more accurate analysis, one needs additional measurements such as Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which can accurately determine the carrier density in the mobile band [S1].
Despite its simplicity our analysis provides the parameter regimes for the electron and hole bands and the qualitative trend of these parameters.
As expected, ne increases with increasing Vg while nh follows the opposite trend [see Fig. S1 (a)].
However, the mobility increases with Vg for both bands.
The drastic rise in mobility µe with increasing Vg can be responsible for large variation in RS.
Since neµ2 e > nhµ2 h for all Vg, Eq. S1 reveals that the Hall slope should be negative as observed in Fig. S1 (c).
Therefore 1/|eRH| starts increasing with increasing Vg (or increasing number of electrons). S2.
ANALYSIS OF MAGNETORESISTANCE DATA Figure S2 presents gate dependence of g-factor as well as the coeﬃcients A and C related to orbital magnetoresistance given by the last term in Eq. (1) of the manuscript.
According to Drude model for a two-dimensional electron gas, the elastic scattering time τ is given by τ = m∗/e2nSRS (m∗is the eﬀective electron mass and nS is the carrier density) and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D can be expressed as: D = v2 F τ/2 (vF = ¯h√2πnS/m∗is the Fermi velocity).
We have extracted D for various Vg and used it for the ﬁtting of magnetoresistance data [Fig. 3 in the manuscript].
The extracted g values are slightly higher than the typical values of 2 for a free electron system and slowly increase with increasing Vg.
Similar gate dependence of g has been observed in (100) interface previously [S2].
A and C are related to the mobility (µ) and as expected increases with µ when the gate voltage Vg is increased.
However, the exact dependencies of these parameters on other measurable transport parameters (like RS, nS etc.) are much more complicated due to multiband charge transport.

Gate dependence of the ﬁtting parameters g (a), A (b) and C (b) at 1.3 K.
We can determine the spin-orbit time τSO and the inelastic time τi using the relations Hi,SO = ¯h/4eDτi,SO.
Therefore, we can determine τSO, τi, and τ using the experimental values of RS, nS (or 1/|eRH|), the ﬁtting parameters Hi, HSO, and a typical m∗= 3me (me is the electronic mass).
These three time scales are presented in Fig. 3(d) of the manuscript.
