Experimental reports  of the electron mobility of this material vary widely depending on the growth conditions and  doping concentrations.
In this work, we calculate the electron mobility of SnO2 from first  principles to examine the temperature- and doping-concentration dependence, and to elucidate the  scattering mechanisms that limit transport.
We include both electron-phonon scattering and  electron-ionized impurity scattering to accurately model scattering in a doped semiconductor.
We  find a strongly anisotropic mobility that favors transport in the direction parallel to the c-axis.
At  room temperature and intrinsic carrier concentrations, the low-energy polar-optical phonon modes  dominate scattering, while ionized-impurity scattering dominates above 1018 cm–3.
Rutile SnO2 is a transparent conductor that finds applications in devices such as  photovoltaics, sensors, and transistors.1–3 The ease of n-type doping by unintentionally  incorporated hydrogen or through impurities (F,  Sb) enables free-electron concentrations in the  1016-1020 cm–3 range.4 Since the first synthesis of SnO2 single crystals,5 numerous experimental  studies have reported a wide range of electron mobility values.6–12 In contrast, first-principles  computational studies of electron transport in SnO2, which enable the determination of the  theoretical upper mobility limit and the differentiation of the various electron-scattering  mechanisms, have emerged only recently.
These existing studies use models and approximations,  This is the author’s peer reviewed, accepted manuscript.

The MLWFs are constructed using first-principles calculation on a coarse BZ grid  and retain first-principles accuracy when interpolating to the fine grids needed to capture electron- scattering processes.
The interpolated quantities are then used to iteratively solve the Boltzmann  transport equation (BTE) and calculate mobility values.20 To make a meaningful comparison to  experiment, mobility calculations need to include the two dominant forms of scattering in heavily- doped semiconductors: electron-phonon scattering and electron-ionized impurity scattering.
The  phonon-limited mobility (intrinsic mobility) represents the upper limit in defect-free  semiconductors.
However, because SnO2 is often doped to high carrier concentrations and has  shallow donor energies,4 the resulting ionized dopants also constitute a significant source of  scattering.
While doping increases the carrier concentration and hence the conductivity, it is  important to also consider how mobility is adversely affected by the resulting increased ionized- impurity concentration.
By including the scattering rates from both electron-phonon and electron- ionized impurity interactions, the combined effect of the two scattering mechanisms can be  captured in the solution of the BTE.16  In this work, we calculate the electron mobility in rutile SnO2 as a function of temperature  and doping concentration from first principles, accounting for scattering by both phonons and  ionized impurities.
We study the temperature dependence of the phonon-limited mobility and  identify the polar-optical phonons as the dominant scattering modes, finding that at room  temperature, the low-energy polar-optical phonons around 30 meV contribute to 82% of the  scattering.
The total mobility, limited by both phonons and ionized impurities, decreases with  increasing carrier concentration due to increasing scattering from ionized dopants.
The mobility is  anisotropic and highest along the c-axis, due to lower electron effective mass and reduced  scattering along this direction.
We also calculate the Hall mobility and find good agreement with  the highest experimentally measured room-temperature mobility values of 260 cm2/V·s.9    To calculate the electron mobility of SnO2, we iteratively solve the Boltzmann transport  equation using material parameters obtained from density functional theory (DFT), density  functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (G0W0 method) as  summarized below.
Specifics of calculation parameters are provided in the supplementary material.
We used Quantum ESPRESSO21,22 to carry out DFT structural-relaxation calculations  within the local density approximation (LDA).
The calculated lattice parameters and other material  properties of SnO2 are in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical studies (Table  I).

PLEASE CITE THIS ARTICLE AS DOI: 10.1063/5.01988853  To improve the description of the band structure, we used the G0W0 method within  BerkeleyGW26,27 to calculate quasiparticle corrections to energies of the electronic states.28–30 The  quasiparticle corrections improve the severely underestimated LDA bandgap (0.749 eV) to a value  of 3.182 eV that is in better agreement with experiment (Table I).
The G0W0 bandgap is still lower  than the experimental value of 3.59 eV,31 but it is the curvature of the bands that affects the  calculation of transport properties.

The equations used for the mobility calculations are  reported in section S2.

To examine the temperature dependence, we set the  carrier concentration at 1017 cm-3 and calculated the mobilities from 100 – 600 K. We also  investigated the carrier-concentration dependence over the 1016 – 1020 cm–3 range at 300 K.   We find that the room-temperature electron drift mobility of SnO2, considering the  combined effects of both phonon and ionized-impurity scattering, for a carrier concentration of  1017 cm–3 is 373 cm2/V·s in the direction parallel to the c-axis and 228 cm2/V·s perpendicular to  the c-axis.
This anisotropy reflects the difference in effective masses, where m∗ is heavier in the  perpendicular direction.
The anisotropy in the mobilities is stronger than in the effective masses  (1.64 compared to 1.46), indicating that, in addition to a directional dependence in the band  curvature, there is also anisotropy in the scattering rates.

The dashed line is the cumulative integral of the scattering rates and 82% represents the  contribution from the lower-energy polar-optical phonon modes.
We next examine the temperature dependence of the drift mobility and its decomposition  in terms of scattering by phonons and ionized impurities (Figure 2).
The phonon-limited mobility  decreases with increasing temperature, as expected due to higher phonon occupations at elevated  temperatures.
We fit the temperature dependence of the phonon-limited mobility according to46:  𝜇ph(𝑇) = ( 1 𝜇low 𝑒 −𝑇low 𝑇 ⁄ + 1 𝜇high 𝑒 −𝑇high 𝑇 ⁄ ) −1 .
(1)  The first term on the right-hand side represents lower-energy phonon modes that dominate  scattering at lower temperatures, while the second term represents higher-energy phonon modes  that dominate at higher temperatures.
In polar semiconductors where macroscopic electric fields  created by longitudinal-optical phonons can couple to electrons, polar-optical phonons are often  the dominant source of phonon scattering.15 Our calculations confirm that the polar-optical modes  contribute the most to limiting the mobility.
The 𝑇low and 𝑇high that we fit (Table SIII) correspond  to the energies of polar-optical Eu modes with approximate frequencies of 30-40 meV and 80 meV,  respectively.
These same polar-optical modes also have the largest mode-resolved electron self- energies (Figure S3).

Because the dominant longitudinal-optical modes are well-described by  dipole interactions, the inclusion of quadrupole interactions changes the mobilities by less than 1%  (Section S5).
We also found that the ionized-impurity-limited mobility increases with increasing  temperature.
This is because carriers with higher kinetic energy are less affected by impurities at  higher temperatures.
The temperature dependence of the ionized-impurity-limited mobility is  characterized by a power-law model:  𝜇ii(𝑇) = 𝜇0 ( 𝑇 300) 𝛼 (2)  where we normalize temperature and set 𝜇0 to the ionized-impurity-limited mobility at 300 K. For  SnO2, we find that α is close to 1 for both directions (Table SIII), indicating that there is a nearly  linear dependence of the ionized-impurity-limited mobility on temperature.
The total drift mobility, which includes the effects of both phonon and ionized-impurity  scattering, is dominated by phonon scattering, as seen by its decreasing value with increasing  temperature.
We characterize the temperature dependence of the total mobility by combining the  previous two equations according to a Matthiessen’s rule-like expression47:  𝜇total(𝑇) = ( 1 𝜇low 𝑒 −𝑇low 𝑇 ⁄ + 1 𝜇high 𝑒 −𝑇high 𝑇 ⁄ + 1 𝜇0 ( 𝑇 300) −𝛼 ) −1 , (3)  where the fitted parameters are listed in Table SIII.
We find that for a moderate dopant  concentration of 1017 cm–3, ionized-impurity scattering is weak and electron-phonon scattering  dominates the mobility.
Furthermore, Matthiessen’s rule does not describe SnO2 well across the  entire temperature range, which can be seen in both the difference in parameters fit for the total  mobility compared to those for the individual mobilities, as well as through a direct comparison  of total mobilities to those computed with Matthiessen’s rule (Figure S4).
This behavior has also  been seen in other semiconductors.16 While the scattering rates are assumed to be independent and  can be added together, this does not mean the inverse of the mobilities can likewise be added  together because of self-consistency in the solution of the BTE and state-dependent scattering  rates.16 Matthiessen’s rule is only a good approximation in SnO2 at high temperatures, at which  phonon scattering dominates.
Next, we examine the dependence of the drift mobility on the carrier concentration.
While  higher doping concentrations introduce more free electrons, they also contribute more scattering  by ionized donor impurities.
Our results (Figure 3a) show that the high mobility values in the low- doping regime (dominated by phonon scattering) decrease by approximately 50% in the high- doping limit.
We fit the carrier-concentration dependence of total mobility with the empirical  expression of Caughey and Thomas:48 This is the author’s peer reviewed, accepted manuscript.

The experimental values are from Bierwagen and Galazka (B & G) and Fonstad and Rediker (F & R).9,12    Finally, to compare to experimental Hall measurements, we calculate the room-temperature  electron Hall mobility of rutile SnO2 as a function of carrier concentration and find good agreement  with experimental values.
The fitted Caughey-Thomas parameters for the Hall mobility are listed  in Table SIV.
Across the examined range of carrier concentrations, the Hall mobility values are  similar to the drift mobility and follow the same trend (Figure 3).
Experimental measurements of  the Hall mobility at various carrier concentrations are also shown in Figure 3b for comparison.
The agreement is excellent in the direction perpendicular to the c-axis, while our calculations  slightly overestimate mobility compared to experiment along the parallel direction.
We compare our results to previous theoretical investigations of carrier transport in SnO2  to explore how different models and approximations affect the calculated mobility values.
A study  of tin-based oxide semiconductors by Hu et al. 13 used the RTA to calculate the phonon-limited  drift and Hall mobility of SnO2. Ref.
13 calculates the acoustic phonon-limited mobility using the  ADP scattering model, the optical phonon-limited mobility using the Fröhlich model, and  combines the two using Matthiessen’s rule to obtain the total phonon-limited mobility.
It finds the  room-temperature drift mobility parallel to the c-axis to be 229 cm2/V·s and perpendicular to be  166 cm2/V·s.
The anisotropy in these mobility values is lower than the anisotropy in our mobility  values, but do agree with the anisotropy of our effective masses.
This is likely because  Ref.
13  assumes isotropic phonon scattering and only considers anisotropy in the directionally-dependent  effective masses.

13 are lower than ours at nondegenerate This is the author’s peer reviewed, accepted manuscript.

This difference could be attributed to the use of the RTA, which underestimates  mobilities compared to iterative solutions of the BTE.
The RTA sums scattering processes into a  scattering rate that only accounts for scattering out of a given state, while iteration allows for  scattering back into a state that increases the lifetime and consequently the mobility.50 In fact, we  find that the room-temperature phonon-limited mobility calculated using the RTA is 40% lower  than iterative solutions of the BTE (Figure S5).
Ref. 13 also calculates the Hall mobility to compare  to experiment, finding a room-temperature Hall factor of 1.38 which is higher than our Hall factors  that range between 0.98 and 1.12 across the temperatures and carrier concentrations (Figure S6).
This discrepancy could be due to the methodology differences for computing the Hall factor. Ref.
13 uses energy-averaged scattering times that assume parabolic bands and isotropy, while our work  uses the BTE augmented with a magnetic field term, which takes into account the full details of  the band structure and scattering processes.
A computational study on mobility in SnO2 that does take into account both phonon and  ionized-impurity scattering was performed by Li et al.14 Similarly to our work, the scattering  mechanisms are combined by summing the individual scattering rates, which is more accurate than  applying Matthiessen’s rule to the individual mobilities.
To calculate scattering rates, Ref.
14 uses  the ADP and Fröhlich models for acoustic and polar-optical phonons, respectively, and the Brooks- Herring model for ionized impurities.
The mobility is calculated with the RTA using the relaxation  times from the summed scattering rates.
In contrast to this work, Ref.
14 obtains an average  mobility by averaging along the different directions.
The total average mobility Ref.
14 finds is  lower than our mobilities in both directions, most likely due to the fact that, similarly to Ref. 13,  this study does not use an iterative solution of the BTE.
Many experimental measurements of mobility have been reported for SnO2,6–8,10,11 but we  compare our results to that of Fonstad and Rediker9 and Bierwagen and Galazka12 because they  specify the direction of mobility measured.
Since our work finds that the mobility values are  strongly directionally-dependent, a proper comparison to experiment must take this anisotropy into  account.
The mobility is highest along the c direction, which implies that aligning the c-axis along  the direction of transport would result in better performance for SnO2 electronic devices.
The  anisotropy we find at room temperature is stronger than that found by Bierwagen and Galazka12  through van der Pauw measurements, which can be seen by our relatively larger mobility along  the c-axis.
The overestimation of mobility can be attributed to extra sources of scattering in  experiment that our theory does not take into account, such as point defects and dislocations.
This  implies that to optimize device performance, it would be best to focus on minimizing other sources  of scattering as the intrinsic mobility of the material itself is high.
Thin-film devices in particular  would benefit most from a reduction in interface roughness, which accounts for the largest  additional source of scattering.
Overestimation of the mobility can also be due to overscreening of  the electron-phonon matrix elements by DFT.45 In summary, we calculate the phonon and ionized-impurity-limited electron drift and Hall  mobility of rutile SnO2 and examine its dependence on temperature and carrier concentration.
We  find that the mobility along the c-axis is approximately 1.6 times higher than in the perpendicular  direction.
The low-frequency polar-optical phonon modes contribute the most to scattering near  room temperature, while high-frequency polar-optical modes dominate at higher temperatures.
We  also examine the carrier concentration dependence of the mobility, including the effects of both  This is the author’s peer reviewed, accepted manuscript.

We also find good agreement between  our calculated Hall mobility values and experimental measurement, particularly along the direction  perpendicular to the c-axis.
Our work provides rigorous, first-principles insights into the dominant  scattering mechanisms and the upper bounds to the electron mobility in rutile SnO2 and can guide  the further development of SnO2-based electronic devices.
