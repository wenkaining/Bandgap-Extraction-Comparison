Non-Fermi liquid and topological states with strong spin-orbit coupling Eun-Gook Moon,1 Cenke Xu,1 Yong Baek Kim,2 and Leon Balents3 1Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA 2Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A7, Canada 3Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA (Dated: September 19, 2018) We argue that a class of strongly spin-orbit coupled materials, including some pyrochlore iridates and the inverted band gap semiconductor HgTe, may be described by a minimal model consist- ing of the Luttinger Hamiltonian supplemented by Coulomb interactions, a problem studied by Abrikosov and collaborators.
It contains two-fold degenerate conduction and valence bands touch- ing quadratically at the zone center.
Using modern renormalization group methods, we update and extend Abrikosov’s classic work and show that interactions induce a quantum critical non-Fermi liquid phase, stable provided time-reversal and cubic symmetries are maintained.
We determine the universal power-law exponents describing various observables in this “Luttinger Abrikosov Be- neslavskii” state, which include conductivity, speciﬁc heat, non-linear susceptibility and magnetic Gruneisen number.
Furthermore, we determine the phase diagram in the presence of cubic and/or time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations, which includes topological insulator and Weyl semi- metal phases.
Many of these phases possess an extraordinarily large anomalous Hall eﬀect, with the Hall conductivity scaling sub-linearly with magnetization, σxy ∼M 0.51.
Divining the nature of critical non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phases of electrons is one of the most outstanding prob- lems in correlated electron systems, such as cuprates, pnictides, and heavy fermion materials [1–4].
Theory, spurred largely by NFL behavior in the cuprates, has fo- cused on models with large Fermi surfaces, appropriate to these materials.
Though there have been promising tech- nical advances[5], this approach has not provided clear resolution of experimental puzzles.
Recent theory and experiment have uncovered a new frontier for correlated phenomena: Mott correlation physics in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [6, 7].
Of particular interest in this regard are the 5d transition metal ox- ides, where compelling evidence has been built for Mott phenomena driven cooperatively by SOC and Coulomb interactions [6–8].
Here we consider the possibility of distinct NFL states in the strong SOC regime.
We are particularly motivated by the pyrochlore iri- dates, A2Ir2O7, where A is a lanthanide element [9, 10].
These materials display T > 0 metal-insulator transi- tions, with the metal-insulator transition temperature decreasing with increasing A radius.
The progression culminates with Pr2Ir2O7, which is a highly unconven- tional metal down to the lowest temperatures [11, 12].
It displays logarithmic NFL behavior of the magnetic sus- ceptibility, and a remarkable enormous zero ﬁeld anoma- lous Hall eﬀect (AHE), in the absence of any measurable magnetization [11, 12].
With these studies as motivation, we utilize prior stud- ies of the electronic structure of pyrochlore iridates[13– 15] to show that a minimal description for the electronic states in their paramagnetic phase is a storied Hamilto- nian from semiconductor physics: the Luttinger model of inverted band gap semiconductors [16].
This model has gained recent notoriety for its relevance to HgTe, the starting material for some topological insulators [17–20].
While HgTe is a weakly correlated material where band structure alone provides a suﬃcient description, in the 5d materials the Luttinger Hamiltonian must be supplanted by interactions.
In this paper, we carry out such an analysis, rediscov- ering and extending a storied analysis by Abrikosov and Beneslavskii of Coulomb forces on the Luttinger prob- lem [21, 22].
Using modern renormalization group (RG) techniques, we conﬁrm Abrikosov’s conclusion that long- range Coulomb interactions convert the quadratic band touching into a quantum critical NFL, prove the stabil- ity of the state within an ϵ expansion, and calculate the full set of anomalous dimensions characterizing the state.
Consequently, we call the resulting phase a Luttinger- Abrikosov-Beneslavskii (LAB) state.
While the LAB phase is stable in the presence of time-reversal and cubic symmetries, we show that it is a “parent” state for other exotic states that can be reached by breaking either or both of these: metallic and double-Weyl semi-metallic phases with enormous anomalous Hall eﬀects (AHEs), and topological insulators.
We discuss the implications for the iridates at the end of the paper.
The LAB phase itself has striking properties.
Its NFL nature is revealed directly by algebraic singularities in the electron spectral function (probed in angle-resolved photoemission) and in optical conductivity, as well as indirectly through many power law thermodynamic and response functions.
We now turn to the exposition of these results.
We consider the paramagnetic band structure based on prior work [13–15], which argued that the states at the zone center (Γ point) near the Fermi energy are comprised of the four-dimensional representation, which can be de- scribed by “angular momentum” operators ⃗J (which are arXiv:1212.1168v1 [cond-mat.str-el]  5 Dec 20122 Weyl Weyl Insulator Metal 0 Π 4 Π 2 3 Π 4 Π Θ 1 2 D FIG.

For H = 0, the insulator is a topological insulator.
j = 3/2 matrices) transforming as the T2 representation of the cubic group.
In our minimal model, we assume only these states close to Γ are important.
Then k · p theory and cubic symmetry determines the band struc- ture in its vicinity to be precisely described by the Lut- tinger Hamiltonian with three eﬀective mass parameters [16, 23], H0(k) = k2 2 ˜ M0 + 5 4k2 −(⃗k · ⃗J)2 2m −(k2 xJ2 x + k2 yJ2 y + k2 zJ2 z ) 2Mc .
This describes doubly degenerate bands with energy E±(k) = k2 2M0 ± s k2 2m 2 + m + 2Mc 4mM 2c pc(k), (1) where pc(k) = P i k4 i −P i̸=j k2 i k2 j and M0 = (4Mc ˜ M0)/(4Mc −5 ˜ M0).
Henceforth we assume M0 > m, which describes conduction and valence bands touching quadratically at E = k = 0, where the chemical potential for the undoped material crosses.
The LAB is obtained by adding to this the long-range Coulomb interaction.
We implement the latter by a scalar potential ϕ, which in the Euclidean path integral formalism gives the action SL = Z dτddx n ψ†h ∂τ −ie ϕ + ˆH0 i ψ + c0 2 (∂iϕ)2o ,(2) with ˆH0 = H0(−i⃗∇) and c0 = 1/4π.
Here ψ is a four- component spinor, but subsequently we will artiﬁcially add an additional U(Nf) ﬂavor index, which allows a check on our calculations by large Nf methods; the phys- ical case is Nf = 1.
Eq. (2) contains in addition to the three mass parameters, the Coulomb coupling constant e.
For e = 0, scale invariance is manifest, with the scaling dimensions [x−1] = 1 , [τ −1] = z , [ψ] = d 2 , [ 1 m] = z −2, [ϕ] = (d + z −2)/2.
Here we introduce the dynamic crit- ical exponent (z), which is naturally z = 2 with e = 0, but will become non-trivial with interactions.
Directly in the physical case d = 3, the dimension of the coupling constant is [e2] = 1, so Coulomb interactions are strongly relevant.
Therefore we employ the ε = 4 −d expansion to control the RG analysis.
As familiar from quantum electrodynamics, three one loop Feynmann di- agrams contribute to leading order in ε: the fermion self- energy, boson self-energy, and vertex correction.
Here we show that the relevance of Coulomb interactions signals, rather than a ﬂow to strong coupling and a symmetry breaking instability, the formation of a new stable inter- acting ﬁxed point, which describes the critical non-Fermi liquid LAB state (Abrikosov’s analysis tacitly assumes this stability).
The RG is carried out perturbatively in e, but non- perturbatively in the mass parameters.
Thus a full treat- ment gives non-trivial and complete beta functions for the two dimensionless mass ratios m/M0, m/Mc; these are given in the Supplementary Material.
The analysis of the full RG shows, however, that there is a single stable isotropic ﬁxed point corresponding to m/M0 = m/Mc = 0, so for simplicity we quote in the main text only the results in the vicinity of this point.
In this limit, the leading contribution to the bosonic self energy becomes 1 Nf Σϕ(q, 0) = −(2m)e2 Z ddk (2π)d 1 k4  × q2, (3) where we took the ω →0 limit because frequency de- pendence is subdominant.
The divergence should be ab- sorbed by rescaling the bosonic ﬁeld, ϕ →e−ηbdℓϕ upon reduction of the hard momentum cutoﬀΛ →e−dℓΛ, which deﬁnes the RG parameter ℓ. This gives the bosonic anomalous dimension ηb = 2Nfu [24], where the dimen- sionless coupling constant is u = m e2 8π2c0Λ4−d , which has the physical meaning in d = 3 of the ratio of the real space cutoﬀto the eﬀective Bohr radius.
The frequency dependence of the one loop fermionic self-energy and the vertex correction both vanish, the result of a Ward iden- tity.
For k ̸= 0, the fermion self-energy gives mass cor- rections, e.g. δ(1/m) = 8u/(15m) × dℓto leading order.
Detailed analysis is given in the Supplementary Material.
Given these calculations, we choose z = 2 −8u/15 to keep the mass m ﬁxed, which gives the RG equations, to lowest order in m/Mc, m/M0: d dℓu = ε u −30Nf + 8 15 u2, (4) d dℓ  m Mc  = −0.152u  m Mc  , d dℓ  m M0  = −8 15u  m M0  .3 From the ﬁrst equation above we ﬁnd the ﬁxed point coupling and hence dynamical exponent, u∗= 15 30Nf + 8ε , z = 2 − 4 15Nf + 4ε, (5) and since u∗> 0, the second line in Eq. (4) implies both m/M0 and m/ Mc are irrelevant.
This establishes the existence and nature of the stable, isotropic ﬁxed point describing the LAB phase.
As a check, we have carried out a large Nf expansion, which gives the same bosonic anomalous dimension as in the ε expansion at the one- loop level, supporting the stability of the LAB phase.
The presence of the stable interacting ﬁxed point can be understood physically as a balance of partial dynam- ical screening of the Coulomb interactions by electron- hole pairs and mass enhancement of the same quasipar- ticles by pairs.
This situation is in sharp contrast to the case of a vanishing indirect band gap, for which to lead- ing order in the long-range Coulomb interaction electrons and holes are separately conserved, so there is no screen- ing by virtual electron-hole pairs, and exciton formation destabilizes the putative gapless state[25].
Using the RG, we can evaluate the anomalous di- mension of any physical operator.
By charge conser- vation, [ψ†ψ] = d. Due to the isotropy of the ﬁxed point, there are only two non-trivial values for the other charge-conserving fermion bilinears.
We obtain , [ψ†Γaψ] = d+η1 , [ψ†Γabψ] = d+η12, , where Γa are the (time-reversal invariant) Dirac gamma matrices, Γab = −i 2[Γa, Γb] are time-reversal odd, and a, b = 1, 2, · · · , 5.
Using the standard operator insertion technique, we ﬁnd η1 = − 6 15Nf +4ε and η12 = − 3 15Nf +4ε.
These operators describe many physical observables, e.g. the “angular momentum” operator Jz ∼ψ†(−Γ34−1 2Γ12)ψ.
The nega- tive anomalous dimension of these operators suggests the a schematic picture of power-law excitons due to electron- hole attraction.
For pairing channels, we ﬁnd positive anomalous dimensions, consistent with this view.
The local pairing channel has ηpairing = u∗ 5 = 3 30Nf +8ϵ. Using these results, we obtain thermodynamic re- sponses such as the speciﬁc heat, cv ∼T d/z ≈T 1.7 and the spin susceptibility χ(T) ∼a + b T (d−z+2η12)/z ≈ a + b T 0.5, with some constants a, b. Interestingly, the non-linear susceptibility χ3 = ∂3M/∂H3 H=0 ∼ T −(3z−4η12−d)/z ≈T −1.7 diverges, as in spin glasses but with completely diﬀerent physics.
Comparing the scaling of current and electric ﬁeld gives the usual result [σij] = d −2.
Consequently, the temperature and frequence de- pendence of the conductivity is σ(ω, T) ∼T 1/zF(ω/T), and a clean, undoped LAB is therefore a power-law insu- lator.
We now turn to the eﬀect of applied strain and Zee- man ﬁeld upon the LAB.
These perturbations break cubic/time-reversal symmetries, and thus destabilize the LAB.
Due to the isotropic nature of the LAB ﬁxed point, the response to the Zeeman ﬁeld alone is to leading or- der independent of its direction (the cubic mass 1/Mc can be “dangerously irrelevant”, however – see below), so we take it to lie along the (001) direction.
We con- sider for simplicity tetragonal strain which preserves C4 rotation about this axis (in the absence of Zeeman ﬁeld, the direction of strain is again unimportant).
This leads to the perturbations H′ = −δ(J2 z −5 4) −H(cos(θ)Jz + sin(θ)J3 z ), (6) where δ parametrizes the strain, h is the Zeeman ﬁeld, and θ controls the strength of the cubic Zeeman term allowed by the cubic symmetry [26, 27].
Using the RG results, the dimensions of these perturbations are [δ] = z−η1 ≈2.1 and [H] = z−η12 ≈1.9; i.e. strain is slightly enhanced while Zeeman ﬁeld is slightly suppressed by interactions.
However, both dimensions are positive and close to 2, so that they are strongly relevant.
They ﬂow to strong coupling under the RG, and the fate of the system must be re-analyzed in the limit.
To do so, we assume, and check self-consistently, that interactions have weak eﬀects at strong coupling, and simply solve the quadratic Hamiltonian (with m/M0 = m/Mc = 0) in the presence of the renormalized H′. The result depends upon the dimensionless quantities θ and the renormalized coupling ratio ∆= (δ/H)R ∼ δ/H(z−η1)/(z−η12).
For H = 0 (∆= ∞), we have time- reversal invariance, and we recover the known result that strain δ > 0 induces a gapped, 3d TI phase, as observed in HgTe [19].
The situation in applied Zeeman ﬁeld is more interesting.
Notice that for ⃗k = kˆz, Jz is a good quantum number, and there is no level repulsion between bands of diﬀerent Jz.
This allows (non-degenerate) bands to cross along this axis, which indeed occurs when |∆| is not too large.
Further analysis in the Supplementary Ma- terial shows that these crossings correspond to a pair of double Weyl points, with linear dispersion along the z axis and quadratic dispersion normal to it.
These points are strength ±2 monopoles in momentum space.
Away from the kz axis, electron and hole pockets may accidentally cross the Fermi energy.
If this does not occur, one has a pristine double Weyl semimetal, which occurs for the angular range θ1 ≤θ ≤θ2, where θ1 = −tan−1( 8+4 √ 3 7 √ 3+26) and θ2 = tan−1( 8−4 √ 3 7 √ 3−26) for δ = 0, as shown in horizontal axis of Fig. 1.
When 0 < |∆| < ∞, we observe insulating, double Weyl semimetal, and Weyl metal (with coexisting electron-hole pockets) phases, as shown in Figure 1.
Note that in all these phases, the Coulomb interactions become either unimportant (in the insulator), screened (in the metal), or marginally irrelevant (in the Weyl semimetal), justifying our treatment of the phase diagram to a ﬁrst approximation.
More subtle eﬀects may make small modiﬁcations to this picture.
Coulomb interactions can destabilize some4 of the quantum phase transitions in Figure 1, leading to intermediate phases.
When the magnetic ﬁeld is applied along a low symmetry axis, the double Weyl points can split into multiple single Weyl points, once the eﬀects of the cubic mass 1/Mc is included, which is dangerously irrelevant in this case.
A striking experimental consequence of this phase di- agram is the AHE due to the Zeeman ﬁeld, which could originate either from an external magnetic ﬁeld or as an exchange ﬁeld due to local moments in the material.
The latter is particularly interesting in light of the experi- mental results on Pr2Ir2O7, which shows a large AHE in a regime where the magnetization M is immeasur- ably small [11, 12].
On symmetry grounds, σxy ̸= 0 implies Mz ̸= 0, but evidently σxy is unusually large relative to M.
This behavior is in fact characteristic of the LAB: since the Hall conductivity has dimensions of inverse length, we expect σxy ∼H1/(z−η12) ≈H0.51.
In the situation relevant for Pr2Ir2O7, the Zeeman ﬁeld is generated by Kondo exchange with the Pr moments, so H ∼JKM, with M the (dimensionless) Pr magnetiza- tion, which implies a highly unconventional sublinear de- pendence of σxy on M for the pristine LAB.
If the Fermi level is displaced from the band touching by an amount ϵF , then we expect, treating the above power as a square root, σxy ∼e2 h q mH ℏ2 S(H/ϵF ), where S is a scaling func- tion (see Supp. Mat.).
This gives an order of magnitude quantitative estimate σxy ∼103Ω−1cm−1 ×    q m me q JK Ry √ M, JKM ≫ϵF q m me JK √ϵF RyM, JKM ≪ϵF , (7) where Ry=13.6eV is the Rydberg, and me is the electron mass.
The lower regime gives σxy ∼0.1Ω−1cm−1, within an order of magnitude of observations in Pr2Ir2O7,[12] for parameters m ∼20me (estimated from the calculations in Ref. 15) , ϵF ∼10meV, JK ∼100K (estimated from the measured Curie-Weiss temperature), and M ∼0.01.
Another interesting experimental observation in Pr2Ir2O7 is a diverging magnetic Gruneisen number ΓH = 1 T ∂T ∂H  S in the zero ﬁeld limit [29–31].
In a purely electronic system with no local moment contribution to the entropy, we can readily obtain the behavior of the LAB in the low temperature limit, ΓH(H, T) = − d −y0z y0(z + ηH) 1 H , (8) which depends upon the exponent y0 deﬁning the tem- perature dependence of the speciﬁc heat, C ∼T y0, of the LAB phase.
In the Weyl metal, y0 = 1, and ΓH < 0, while for isolated double Weyl points, y0 = 2, and ΓH > 0.
Thus one may imagine a sign change of the Gruneisen number when ﬁeld or strain is varied.
Note that in Pr2Ir2O7, there is certainly a large local moment contribution to the entropy, so that Eq. (8) is not liter- ally applicable.
Nevertheless, the LAB physics may play some role in this quantity.
In conclusion, we have described a novel NFL phase occurring in correlated strong SOC systems, with a natu- ral connection to the pyrochlore iridates.
Even with weak correlation eﬀects, some of the phenomena discussed here can be observed with only minor modiﬁcations, and it would be interesting to search for them in HgTe.
Fu- ture theoretical studies should include more comprehen- sive treatment of breaking of cubic symmetries, and the eﬀects of disorder and doping.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Representations of the Hamiltonian In this section, we provide more information about the diﬀerent representations used in the main text.
The Hamiltonian reads H0(k) = α1k2 + α2(⃗k · ⃗J)2 + α3(k2 xJ2 x + k2 yJ2 y + k2 zJ2 z ) = k2 2 ˜ M0 + ( 5 4k2 −⃗k · ⃗J)2 2m −(k2 xJ2 x + k2 yJ2 y + k2 zJ2 z ) 2Mc = da(k) 2m Γa + k2 2M0 + d4(k)Γ4 + d5(k)Γ5 2Mc .
(9) The ﬁrst line uses the conventional Luttinger parameters (α1,2,3) in the j = 3/2 matrix representation, and the second line is the form used in the main text.
For the purpose of computations, it is convenient to introduce the Cliﬀord gamma matrices (Γa) in the third line as in the paper by Murakami et al. [23]. ϵa(k) = da(k) 2m , d1(k) = − √ 3kykz , d2(k) = − √ 3kxkz , d3(k) = − √ 3kxky, d4(k) = − √ 3 2 (k2 x −k2 y) , d5(k) = −1 2 (2k2 z −k2 x −k2 y).
(10) It is straightforward to relate the masses used in the main text and the Luttinger αi parameters.
This can be done by expressing the spin operators in terms of gamma ma- trices, using the equalities Jx = √ 3 2 Γ15 −1 2(Γ23 −Γ14) , Jy = − √ 3 2 Γ25 + 1 2(Γ13 + Γ24) , Jz = −Γ34 −1 2Γ12 , (11) where Γab = 1 2i[Γa, Γb] is used.
Weyl semimetal Here we consider how the Weyl semimetal appears, taking for simplicity the case δ = 0, θ1 < θ < θ2.
It is straightforward to generalize this to the cases with δ ̸= 0.
For convenience, we set m = 1/2.
For ⃗k = (0, 0, kz), the Hamiltonian in the presence of the Zeeman ﬁeld, h (along the same axis), becomes H(kzˆz) = k2 z(5 4 −J2 z ) −H(cos(θ)Jz + sin(θ)J3 z ).
Clearly, the energy eigenstates can be labeled by both kz and Jz = ±1/2, ±3/2.
One can readily see that level crossings occur between the two bands with Jz = 1/2 and Jz = −3/2.
In the vicinity of these crossing points, the other states with Jz = −1/2, +3/2 can be discarded, and the Hamiltonian projected onto the two level subspace of low energy states.
We introduce Pauli matrices in this subspace, so that τ z = | 1 2⟩⟨1 2| −| −3 2⟩⟨−3 2|, τ + = (τ x + iτ y)/2 = | 1 2⟩⟨−3 2| = (τ −)†, and τ 0 = | 1 2⟩⟨1 2| + | − 3 2⟩⟨−3 2|, which is the identity matrix in the 2×2 subspace.
We deﬁne two energy parameters, ϵ−3/2 = H( 3 2 cos(θ) + 27 8 sin(θ)) and ϵ1/2 = −H( 1 2 cos(θ) + 1 8 sin(θ)).
Then the reduced Hamiltonian becomes H2 = ϵ+τ 0 + (ϵ−+ d5(k))τ z + d4(k)τ x −d3(k)τ y, ϵ± = (ϵ−3/2 ± ϵ1/2)/2.
(12) There are level crossing points at kx = ky = 0 and kz = ±K, with K = √ϵ−.
We expand around these points, letting kx = px, ky = py and kz = ±K + pz, which gives H2(±Kˆz + ⃗p) = ϵ+τ 0 + H± 2 (⃗p), with, to leading order in ⃗p, H± 2 = ∓v pzτ z + d4(p)τ x + d3(p)τ y , with v = 2√ϵ−.
The energy spectrum is E(p) = ± r v2p2z + 3 4(p2x + p2y)2.
We see that the electrons disperse linearly along the ﬁeld and quadratically orthogonal to it, near the touch- ing point.
This can be understood as a consequence of 4-fold rotational symmetry around the z axis.
Since |Jz⟩→eiπJz/2|Jz⟩under such a rotation, the operators τ ± carry a net angular momentum of ±2, and therefore must couple to the “d-wave” combinations of px and py, which are precisely given by d3(p) and d4(p).
Though the quadratic dispersion normal to the ﬁeld is due to symmetry, the touching itself has a topological character.
To see it, it is convenient to deﬁne the reduced Hamiltonian in the form H± 2 = ⃗b±(⃗p) · ⃗τ, (13)6 with ⃗b±(⃗p) =   − √ 3 2 (p2 x −p2 y) √ 3pxpy ∓vpz  . (14) From this, one can deﬁne the U(1) Berry ﬂux, which is analogous to a magnetic ﬁeld in momentum space, Bµ ± = 1 8π ϵµνλˆb± · ∂νˆb± × ∂νˆb±, (15) where ˆb± = ⃗b±/|⃗b±|, and the derivatives are with respect to ⃗p.
By construction, the magnetic ﬁeld is divergence- less, ∂µBµ ± = 0, away from points of singularity where ⃗b± vanishes.
However, the band touching point is such a singularity, and it is in fact a source of Berry ﬂux.
To see this, one may compute the integral of the ﬂux of Bµ through a sphere around one of the touching points.
It is straightforward to compute this integral, and by doing so one ﬁnds ∂µBµ(⃗p) = ±2δ(⃗p).
(16) Thus each band touching is a source of two quanta of Berry ﬂux, and can be therefore considered a double Weyl point.
The net Berry ﬂux of both double Weyl points added together vanishes, which is required as the Bril- louin zone is a closed manifold without any boundary through which a net ﬂux may escape.
The Berry ﬂux of each double Weyl point is directly related to the Hall conductivity.
Indeed, one can show quite generally that the Hall conductivity is proportional to separation of the points,[28] σxy = = 2 × e2 h × 2K 2π , where the ﬁrst factor of 2 is due to the doubled nature of the Weyl points.
This is valid at zero temperature when the Fermi level is at the energy of the double Weyl points.
Neglecting the small corrections to the exponent due to Coulomb interactions, we have K ∼ √ mH, which explains the estimate in Eq. (7) of the main text.
RG equations Here we describe the renormalization of the fermionic propagator, which was not presented in the main text.
We start with the Hamiltonian H0(k) = k2 2M0 Γ0 + ϵa(k)Γa + d4(k)Γ4 + d5(k)Γ5 2Mc , where we deﬁned Γ0 as the 4 × 4 unit matrix to empha- size the matrix structure.
The corresponding eﬀective Lagrange density is Leﬀ= ψ†(−iωnΓ0 + H0(k) −Σf(k, iωn))ψ.
Here we have included the one-loop self energy needed for the ε expansion.
It is given by Σψ(k, iωn) = (17) −g2 Z q T X Ωn Gf(k + q, iωn + iΩn)Gϕ(q, iΩn) , where G−1 f (k, iω) = −iωΓ0 + H0(k), G−1 ϕ (q, iΩ) = c0q2 are used.
Note that the bosonic propagator does not have frequency dependence since it represents the instan- taneous Coulomb interaction.
By integrating out high momentum degrees of freedom, we investigate the renor- malization of fermion parameters.
Frequency and momentum dependences of the self en- ergy determine anomalous dimensions of the fermion ﬁeld and mass terms, respectively.
At one-loop level, the fermion self energy does not have frequency depen- dence due to the instantaneous Coulomb interaction, so no anomalous dimension of the fermion ﬁeld appears.
Moreover, the frequency-independence makes one mass coupling (1/M0) unchanged at one loop level and it is be- cause frequency and this mass term have the same unity matrix structure.
Note that both corrections naturally appear in higher-loop contributions.
On the other hand, non-trivial renormalizations of isotropic mass (m) and anisotropic mass (Mc) appear even at one-loop level.
For example, the renormalization of isotropic mass term can be read oﬀby calculating the third component (Γ3) of the self energy, γ3(k) ≡Tr  Γ3 ∂2 ∂kx∂ky Σψ(k, 0)  /Tr(Γ3Γ3) = −g2 c0 ∂ ∂kx∂ky Z q ϵ3(k + q) r (k+q)2 2m 2 + m+2Mc 4mM 2 c pc(k + q) 1 q2 .
It can be understood as the self energy corrrection to the original Hamiltonian, ϵ3(k) →ϵ3(k) −γ3(0)kxky = ϵ3(k)  1 + uf1( m Mc ) log(Λ µ )  .
(18) In the last line, the momentum integration is done for µ < q < Λ. The correction to the isotropic mass term, δ(1/m) = u mf1( m Mc ) log( Λ µ ) can be regularized in the stan- dard way.
Along the same line, one can determine the renormalization of the anisotropic mass term by calcu- lating the fourth component (Γ4) of the self-energy.
These considerations lead to the full RG equations as7 follows.
d dl( 1 m) =  z −2 + uf1( m Mc )  ( 1 m) , d dl( m M0 ) = −uf1( m Mc ) m M0 , d dl( m Mc ) = −uF2( m Mc ) , d dl(u) = ε u −NfF1( m Mc )u2 .
Here the following functions of anisotropy are introduced.
f1(x) = 2 π Z dΩk ˆk2 xˆk2 y q 1 + x(2 + x)pc(ˆk) , f2(x) = 1 2π Z dΩk (ˆk2 x −ˆk2 y)2 q 1 + x(2 + x)pc(ˆk) , f3(x) = 3 8π Z dΩk x4k2 x(ˆk2 y −ˆk2 z)2 q 1 + x(2 + x)pc(ˆk) 5 + O( 1 x) , F1(x) = 2f3(x) + 1 Nf f1(x) , F2(x) = (1 + x) (f1(x) −f2(x)) , where pc(k) = P3 i=1 k4 i −P i̸=j k2 i k2 j is used.
The ﬁrst two functions, f1 and f2, are from the fermion self energy and the third function, f3, is from the boson self-energy calculation.
The asymptotic form of f3 is shown above while its complete form can be obtained by evaluating the bosonic self energy function directly.
Numerical evalua- tions of these functions are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.
Useful numerical values are NfF1(0) = 30Nf + 8 15 , F2(0) = 0 , F ′ 2(0) ∼0.152 , f1(0) = f2(0) = 8 15 , f3(0) = 1 , lim x→∞f1(x) = lim x→∞f2(x) = 0 , lim x→∞f3(x) ∼0.888.
We note that there is one subtle issue in the ε expan- sion for regularization of the loop corrections.
Since the gamma matrices are deﬁned in speciﬁc dimensions, there is some ambiguity for the choice of gamma matrices in dimensional regularization.
There have been some sug- gestions as to how to apply the ϵ expansion to Gamma matrices.
[22] In this letter, we use one of possible regularization schemes; the angle dependence is ﬁrst integrated in the original dimension and then dimensional regularization is used for the integrals over the magnitude of momen- tum.
One reason for using this scheme is our need to keep track of the cubic anisotropy, which is speciﬁcally deﬁned 20 40 60 80 100 x 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 f1@xD, f2@xD FIG. 2.

Formally, the momentum shell integration gives R Λ Λe−dl ddq (2π)d 1 q4 → dl 8π2 .
Note that diﬀerent regularization schemes only change numerical coeﬃcients and do not change important physics.
