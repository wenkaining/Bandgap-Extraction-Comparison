Direct access to the dynamics of SCC – a crucial ingredient in optimizing TI based  spintronic devices – remains conspicuously missing.
The difficultly of tracking SCC dynamics  stems from the need to address both the ultrafast timescales involved as well as obtain spin  resolution simultaneously.
In this work, we probe the dynamical processes of SCC in Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures directly  for the first time, via ultrafast spin injection and terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy.
Ultrafast spin injection from ferromagnetic Co enables transient spin currents to be injected.[20- 23] At the same time, given the challenging timescales involved, THz emission spectroscopy –  the central signature we track — is a powerful optical tool, which offers a contact-free  amperemeter with sub-picosecond resolution.
As we describe below, this technique combined  with a systematic exhaustion of the experimental parameters of the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures  and our ultrafast setup (thickness, temperature, Co magnetization direction, optical pulse  polarization, etc.), enables an unprecedented detailed window into the key parameters of SCC  including the timescale as well as the spatial locality of ultrafast spin-to-charge conversion.
In particular, we find a highly efficient THz emission (mediated by ultrafast spin injection)  from the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
Strikingly, this far outstrips (by up to an order of  magnitude) the emission of either bare Bi2Se3 or Co films taken individually, indicating the  highly efficient SCC in the Bi2Se3/Co stack, as well as the central role SCC plays in the optical  response of the heterostructure.
Crucially, the THz signal in the Bi2Se3/Co stack exhibits a  significant enhancement when the thickness of Bi2Se3 increases from four to six quintuple  layers.
Coinciding with the appearance of well-defined surface states,[24] this indicates the  dominant role of surface states in the SCC processes.
In addition, varying pump polarization enables a direct tracking of the SCC process.
We  identify the fundamental timescale for ultrafast SCC formation in Bi2Se3/Co to be ~0.12 ps.3 This sets a characteristic cut-off time for SCC processes in TI spintronic heterostructures.
Our  results provide fundamental insights into the ultrafast SCC processes and indicate the central  role of topological surface states in the very efficient SCC at room temperature for THz opto- spintronic applications.
Dynamical response of pure Bi2Se3 thin films.
In order to methodically delineate the THz  emission signals in our Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures (see below), we first describe the optical  response (focusing on its THz response) of pure Bi2Se3 thin films grown by molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE).
As we will discuss, this enables us to clearly isolate the new dynamics that  arises due to the TI/FM heterostructure stack from the response of either the pure TI or pure  FM by themselves.
Bi2Se3 thin films samples were setup in a transmission geometry, as shown in Figure 1a,  where an 800-nm pump beam with 60 mW power impinged on the samples at normal incidence,  and only the vertical components of the emitted THz pulses were detected by electro-optic  sampling.
The typical THz electric field waveforms emitted from Bi2Se3 films are plotted in  Figure 1b.
The spectra of the detected THz signals, as shown in the inset of Figure 1b, covers  the frequency range up to 3 THz, which is limited by the electro-optic detection of 1-mm-thick  ZnTe crystal.
A SiO2 capping layer is essential to protect the Bi2Se3 film from the atmosphere,  and prevent the evaporation of the thin film under pulsed-laser illumination due to the weak  van der Waals type coupling between the two neighboring quintuple layers (QLs, 1 QL~1  nm).[25] The detected THz traces show a distinct dependence on the pump polarization.
Figure  1c shows the THz peak amplitude as a function of pump polarization angle, which can be fitted  well by a sinusoidal function with a period of 180°.
In addition, the dependence of THz  amplitude on sample azimuthal angle reveals a characteristic three-fold symmetry (see Figure  S2), which is associated with the crystalline symmetry of Bi2Se3.[26] These are in good  agreement with the expectations from the shift current mechanism (see Supporting Information  Section S2, for further exclusion of other mechanisms).[27,28] Additionally, we note that the4    dependence of the THz peak amplitude on the incident pump power, as indicated in the inset of  Figure 1d, shows a nonlinear behavior, which we attribute to saturable absorption (Supporting  Information Section S3).[29] In principle, the shift current is a second-order nonlinear effect, which requires the breaking  of spatial inversion symmetry,[30-32] and hence can only be excited on the surface of three- dimensional TIs.[33-35] Consequently, the amplitude should be independent of the thickness of  the Bi2Se3 film.
Indeed, the THz peak amplitude is roughly constant for the samples above 6  QL, as illustrated in Figure 1d.
Interestingly, for the 4-QL sample, the measured THz signal is  about one order of magnitude smaller than that from the films above 6 QL.
It has been reported  that the shift current in Bi2Se3 originates from the transient charge transfer along the Se-Bi  bonds involving the surface-states-related optical transitions.[27] However, for the ultrathin  Bi2Se3 film with a thickness below 6 QL, the coupling between the top and bottom surface  opens a gap in the surface-state dispersion,[24] and hence suppresses the surface-states-related  optical transitions.[36] Therefore, the shift current and resulting THz emission decrease  considerably.
This observation indicates that the THz emission from pure Bi2Se3 film is a  surface-dominated response.
THz emission from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
We now turn to investigate the THz  response of Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
As we show below, the dynamics of this TI/FM  heterostructure starkly contrasts with that of the TI by itself.
The experiments are performed  under identical conditions as that for the pure Bi2Se3 films, except that an in-plane external  static magnetic field ~800 Oe is applied to orient the Co magnetization, as sketched in Figure  2a.
The THz waveform emitted from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure, together with that from pure  Bi2Se3 and Co films, is shown in Figure 2b.
Strikingly, the THz emission from the heterostructure is significantly enhanced after the  deposition of a Co layer.
Indeed, for the same TI film thickness, the THz emission amplitude  from the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure (orange curve) is about an order of magnitude larger than5    that of a pure Bi2Se3 film by itself (blue curve).
We note that the detected THz emission from  a 3-nm Co film by itself (green curve) is weak; this indicates that the laser-induced  demagnetization in the magnetic film contributes negligibly to THz emission in TI/FM  heterostructures.[37,38] Furthermore, in contrast to that of the pure Bi2Se3 film, the THz emission  amplitude from the heterostructure obeys a linear power dependence up to high power (> 40  mW), as illustrated in the inset of Figure 2d.
These observations indicate that THz emission  from the heterostructure cannot be explained by dynamics from that of the pure TI or FM by  themselves.
Instead, as we now explain, it arises from the novel coupled spin-charge dynamics in the  Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure.
In order to understand this, we note that under the illumination of  800 nm laser beam, a spin-polarized current is set up at the interface of the Bi2Se3/Co  heterostructure due to the different mobilities of the majority- and minority-spin sp-band  electrons in the Co layer.[20] Due to the existence of strong SOC in Bi2Se3, the ultrafast injected  spin current can be converted to an ultrafast charge current via either the inverse Edelstein effect  (IEE) on the surface or the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in the bulk.[39-42] This SCC  conversion process can lead to the large-amplitude THz waveforms that we detect from the  TI/FM heterostructure.
We note that the SCC transient charge currents generated by both IEE  and ISHE flow in the same direction ¾ since 𝒋𝒄∝𝒛% × 𝝈 in IEE[13,41,43] and 𝒋𝒄∝𝒋𝒔× 𝝈 in  ISHE,[39,42] where 𝒋𝒄 is the charge current, 𝒋𝒔 is the spin current, 𝝈 is the direction of the spin  polarization, and 𝒛% is the unit vector normal to the TI/FM interface (which is parallel to 𝒋𝒔).
As  a result, the polarization of the emitted THz pulses from both ISHE and IEE also point in the  same direction.
To confirm the central role of SCC in the Bi2Se3/Co stack THz emission, we oriented the  magnetization in the Co layer using an in-plane magnetic field ¾ this enables the tuning of the  spin-polarization injected into the TI film.
As shown in Figure 2c, the polarity of the emitted6    THz pulses reverses when either (1) the direction of magnetic field was reversed, or when (2)  the pump beam was incident on the opposite side of the heterostructure, as expected from SCC  (IEE and/or ISHE) THz emission mechanism.
While (1) displays the spin origin of the  Bi2Se3/Co stack THz emission, (2) displays its spin-current dependence, since the spin current  flips its direction relative to the lab frame when the sample is pumped from the back.
Indeed, since the spin polarization 𝝈 is determined by the external magnetic field, the  abovementioned two SCC mechanisms also predict that the measured (𝑥-projected) THz  electric field, obeys 𝐸+,- . ∝|𝒋𝒔× 𝝈|.
∝𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜙, where 𝜙 is the magnetic field angle with respect  to the positive 𝑥-axis.
As shown in Figure 2d, the THz peak amplitude is locked to the magnetic  field direction and exhibits a one-fold sinusoidal behavior, and allows direct magnetic field  control of THz emission.
This, therefore, demonstrates a novel spin-charge dynamics that is  enabled by SCC in TI/FM heterostructures.
Separation of THz waveforms and SCC timescale.
Pump-polarization-dependent  measurements provide a further means of quantifying the contributions to the THz emission  from the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
In contrast to that from pure Bi2Se3 films, we observe only  small changes in the amplitude and phase of the measured THz waveform as a function of pump  polarization angle, as shown in Figure 3a.
This is fully consistent with a dominant THz  emission contribution from SCC that is independent of pump polarization.[21-23] Figure 3b plots  the THz electric field at 𝑡= 0 ps as a function of the pump polarization angle, showing a small- amplitude oscillation superposed on top of a large dc offset.
As explained in the last section,  the small-amplitude polarization-dependent contribution can be ascribed to the THz generation  from the Bi2Se3 film itself.
On the basis of these characteristics, we can separate out the THz waveform contributed by  (a) the TI film alone (that is via the shift-current mechanism), 𝐸+7(𝑡), and (b) from SCC in the  TI/FM heterostructure, 𝐸;<<(𝑡).
This is done by performing for (a) 𝐸+7(𝑡) = [𝐸(𝑡, 𝜃= 0°) − 𝐸(𝑡, 𝜃= 90°)]/2 , and for (b) 𝐸;<<(𝑡) = [𝐸(𝑡, 𝜃= 0°) + 𝐸(𝑡, 𝜃= 90°)]/2 .
The resulting7    delineated THz waveforms are shown in Figure 3c.
For comparison, the THz waveform emitted  from pure 10-QL Bi2Se3 film is also plotted.
Notice that in the Co/Bi2Se3 heterostructure, the  THz signal contributed by the shift-current mechanism is smaller than that from pure Bi2Se3 —  this can be attributed to the reflection or absorption of the 800-nm pump beam by the Co film.
The extracted TI component shows a very similar temperature dependence to that of pure Bi2Se3  film, as shown in Figure S7, giving further evidence that they share the same origin (Supporting  Information Section S7).
Interestingly, this delineation enables a temporal difference between these two extracted THz  waveforms to be discerned ¾ the SCC-component lags the TI-component (shift current) by  ~0.12 ps.
This can be seen more clearly in the plot of normalized THz waveforms in the inset  of Figure 3c.
The significance of this delay can be appreciated by first noting that to a good approximation,  we can assume that the 800-nm light hits the surface of the Co and Bi2Se3 layer simultaneously  due to the ultrathin Co layer.
Upon optical excitation, the shift current originates from the  instantaneous shift of electron density along the Se-Bi bond,[27] while it takes a longer time to  generate a spin current in the FM layer, diffuse into the Bi2Se3 film, and then be converted to a  charge current.[22,23] To quantify the spin transport in the FM layer, we vary the Co thickness  from 2 to 16 nm while keeping the thickness of Bi2Se3 fixed at 10 QL.
The amplitude of the  THz signal contributed by the SCC component is maximum at ~3 nm, and then decreases with  increasing Co thickness (see Figure S3), which we attribute to the smaller amounts of 800-nm  light reaching the Co/Bi2Se3 interface due to the small penetration depth in Co (13 nm)[44] and  hence smaller injection of the laser-driven spin current.[22,23] Figure 3d shows that the extracted  temporal delay is independent of the thickness of Co layer.
This is consistent with the picture  of superdiffusive spin transport in Co, where the timescale of the multiplication of carriers is  only dependent on the material (Supporting Information Section S4).
Therefore, the temporal  difference of ~0.12 ps corresponds to the time needed for the formation of a maximum charge8    current from the peak of the laser pulse, and thus characterizes the SCC processes in the  Bi2Se3/Co heterostructure.
This value is of the same order as that deduced by theoretical  simulations of the spin dynamics (0.1 – 0.3 ps) in heavy-metal/FM heterostructures.[22,23] Thickness dependence of THz emission from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
In order to  verify whether the observed SCC is dominated by IEE on the surface or ISHE in the bulk, we  perform measurements on different thicknesses of Bi2Se3 film while fixing the Co thickness at  4 nm.
Figure 4a shows the THz peak amplitude of the extracted SCC component as a function  of Bi2Se3 thickness.
At 4 QL, the emitted THz signal is relatively small, while it increases by  about one order of magnitude as we go from 4 to 6 QL.
We see the same thickness dependence  of THz emission in pure Bi2Se3 films with thicknesses from 4 to 10 QL (shown in Figure 1d),  indicating therefore that the THz emission mechanism in TI/FM is also a surface-dominated  response.
Although the Bi2Se3 film may be doped by the metallic Co layer (Supporting  Information Section S1), the dramatic enhancement of the THz signal at 6 QL can be still  ascribed to the formation of gapless surface states,[24] as has been discussed earlier in pure  Bi2Se3 films.
On the other hand, if ISHE in the bulk were to play a major role in THz emission of TI/FM  heterostructures, the detected THz signal can be written as 𝐸+,- .
∝𝜆GH𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎK𝑑2𝜆GH ⁄ N, where  𝜆GH is the spin diffusion length and 𝑑 is the thickness of Bi2Se3 film.[18,40,45] However, this spin  diffusion model cannot account for the Bi2Se3 thickness dependence of THz peak amplitude  (Supporting information Section S5).
Therefore, we conclude that the SCC processes in TI/FM  heterostructures are dominated by the topological surface states, though we cannot completely  exclude a possible contribution from ISHE in the bulk.
For the thicker samples (above 10 QL),  the extracted THz signal decreases with increasing thickness.
This probably originates from the  carrier absorption in the bulk since the THz transients are generated at the interface of the  heterostructure.
Figure 4a also shows the electric-field transmittance of pure Bi2Se3 films at 19    THz (corresponding to the peak of THz waveforms) upon optical excitation, which decreases  with increasing film thickness (Supporting Information Section S6).
The observed agreement  between the thickness dependence of the THz signal and the pump transmittance (for samples  above 4 QL) suggests that the suppression of the THz amplitude is attributed to the absorption  of THz radiation by both the intrinsic bulk carriers and the photo-generated free carriers in  Bi2Se3 films.
Temperature dependence.
We also investigated the temperature dependence of THz  emission from both the Bi2Se3 (10 QL) film and the Bi2Se3/Co (4 nm) heterostructures with  different Bi2Se3 thicknesses.
Cooling the pure Bi2Se3 film from room temperature down to 10  K increases the emitted THz signal, which we attribute to a higher carrier mobility at low  temperature (Supporting Information Section S7).
In contrast, as shown in Figure 4b, the THz  peak amplitude of the extracted SCC component does not change with temperature for four  representative samples with different Bi2Se3 thicknesses.
In this temperature range (10 – 300  K), the spin diffusion length of the Co layer (38 – 59 nm) is much larger than the thickness of  Co layer used in our case,[46] implying a constant spin current injection from the Co layer into  the TI at different temperatures.
Therefore, the temperature-insensitive THz emission implies  that the SCC efficiency via IEE is also independent of temperature.
This is consistent with  previous work on the temperature evolution of IEE in metallic Ag/Bi junctions.[47] In TIs, IEE  originates from the spin-momentum-locked surface states, which is a result of strong SOC.[1,2] As a relativistic effect, it is expected to be temperature-independent.[48] Consequently, the  resulting THz signal contributed by the IEE should be temperature insensitive, in good  agreement with our experimental results, confirming once again the dominant contribution from  the topological surface states to the observed SCC in TI/FM heterostructures.
The spin-momentum-locked topological surface states have been predicted to possess  superior SCC efficiency.[1,3,4] However, previous reported values of the SCC efficiency exhibit  a large range over several orders of magnitude (from 10-4 to 0.8).[13-17] In order to evaluate the10    SCC efficiency in Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3 nm) heterostructures, we compare its THz emission  amplitude to that from the Pt (2 nm)/Co (3 nm) bilayer structure ¾ we choose a Pt thickness of  2 nm to match a single TI surface state thickness of 𝑡~2 nm,[49,50] since SCC via IEE is restricted  to the top surface of Bi2Se3 in the heterostructure.
As shown in Figure S8, the THz peak  amplitude of Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3 nm) is ~1.7 times of that from Pt (2 nm)/Co (3 nm) under  identical experimental conditions.
Since the spin currents are generated by optically exciting an  out-of-equilibrium electron distribution in the Co layer (Supporting Information Section S4), it  is reasonable to assume that they have similar magnitudes in both heterostructures.[20,22] Consequently, the effective SCC efficiency 𝜃PHH = 𝑗R/𝑗G is a function only of charge current  and hence THz signal amplitude.
As a rough estimate, we use a measured spin Hall angle of  ~0.03 for the 2-nm-thick Pt film.[51-54] Thus, we obtain θPHH~0.03 × 1.7~0.05 for 10-QL  Bi2Se3 film.
Using 𝜆7YY = Z [ 𝜃PHH ∙𝑡 as defined in Equation S7 and 𝑡~2 nm, we obtain the IEE  length 𝜆7YY ∼50 pm charactering the SCC efficiency of the surface states, which is in good  agreement with the spin-pumping measurements in TI/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructures  (35 – 76 pm).[18,19] Note that if we use a larger measured spin Hall angle for the 2-nm-thick Pt  film,[51-54] as well as include the interfacial spin transparency,[54-57] we will obtain a larger SCC  efficiency for Bi2Se3 (see Supporting Information Section S8 for further discussion on these  points).
Remarkably, the amplitude of the THz emission from the Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3 nm)  heterostructure is only slightly smaller than that from the Pt (6 nm)/Co (3 nm) bilayer structure  (see Figure S8), and the latter has been demonstrated to be a very efficient broadband THz  emitter comparable to the standard ZnTe THz emitter.[21,23,58] In this regard, the temperature- insensitive SCC efficiency suggests promising applications of topological surface states in THz  spintronic devices at room temperature.11    In conclusion, we have systematically demonstrated, for the first time, highly-efficient  ultrafast spin-injection and spin-to-charge conversion in topological-insulator/ferromagnet  heterostructures using THz emission spectroscopy.
Locked to the Co magnetization direction,  THz emission from Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures far outstrips the emission of either Bi2Se3 or Co  individually.
This underscores the central role the novel TI spin-charge dynamics play in  response of the heterostructure.
While we have focused on the THz response of Bi2Se3/Co to  elucidate its SCC dynamics, large non-equilibrium spin injection into a TI afforded by our  methodology unlocks easy access to a range of spin-type responses previously difficult to  realize in TIs, including tunable generation of ultrafast spin and charge current in the bulk  and/or surface.
Perhaps most tantalizing is the fast timescale in which efficient SCC in Bi2Se3  occurs within ~0.12 ps.
This paves the way for high speed and ultra-thin opto-spintronic devices  with operating speeds up to several terahertz.
Experimental Section  Sample fabrication: High-quality thin films of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 with  thicknesses of 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 40 QLs were grown by a two-step deposition process using  MBE on c-axis Al2O3 substrate (0.5 mm).
The samples were transferred through air into the  sputtering chamber for capping layer and magnetic layer deposition.
For pure Bi2Se3 films, the  samples were protected by a SiO2 capping layer (4 nm).
For the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures, a  nanometer-thick Co layer (2 to 16 nm) was deposited onto the Bi2Se3 films by sputtering and  then capped with the same SiO2 capping layer to prevent oxidation of the magnetic layer.
For  comparison, a pure Co layer (3 nm) on an Al2O3 substrate with the same capping layer was also  prepared.
Please see Supporting Information Section 1 for more sample information.
THz emission setup: A Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Coherence Legend; center  wavelength 800 nm; duration 50 fs; repetition rate 1 kHz) was employed in this work.
The beam  was split into two parts: one for the pump beam and the other one for THz detection, by an12    optical beam splitter.
The pump beam with an incident power of 60 mW and a spot size 7 mm  (0.156 mJ/cm2) impinged on the samples at normal incidence from the sample side.
Any  residual pump beam after the sample was blocked by a piece of 1/16-inch-thick high-density  polyethylene (HDPE), which is transparent in the THz frequency range.
The THz pulses  generated were projected onto the x-axis (vertical) by using a wire-grid THz polarizer, and then  collected and focused by two parabolic mirrors onto a 1-mm-thick <110> ZnTe crystal for free- space electro-optic sampling.
A cryostat was used in the temperature-dependent experiments,  in which the magnets were fixed along the y (horizontal) direction.
The remaining experiments  were performed at room temperature in a dry air atmosphere.
A half-wave plate and a pair of  permanent magnets in the dipole configuration were mounted on rotation stages to vary the  polarization of pump pulses and to align the magnetization of the Co layer, respectively.
A  visible wire grid polarizer for the 800-nm beam was placed before the half-wave plate.
The  magnetic field at the sample position was ~800 Oe.

2016, 4, 1944.16          Figure 1. THz emission from Bi2Se3 thin films.
a) Schematic illustration of THz emission  from Bi2Se3 films.
The sample is excited by femtosecond laser pulses (800 nm, 60 mW) from  the sample side, and the vertical component of the emitted THz pulses is detected by electro- optic sampling.
θ is polarization angle of pump beam with respect to the 𝑥-axis. b) Typical THz  waveforms emitted from Bi2Se3 films with different thicknesses.
The inset shows the  corresponding spectra. c) Peak amplitude of THz waveforms from 10-QL Bi2Se3 film as a  function of polarization angle θ.
The solid line shows a sinusoidal fit.
d) Peak amplitude of the  THz signal as a function of Bi2Se3 thickness.
The dashed line is a guide to the eye.
The inset  shows the power dependence of the THz emission from the 10-QL Bi2Se3 film, exhibiting  saturation behavior.
The solid line shows the fit with the saturable absorption model.17          Figure 2. THz emission from Bi2Se3 (10 QL)/Co (3 nm) heterostructure.
a) Sketch of the  experimental geometry for the Bi2Se3/Co heterostructures.
An external magnetic field Hext is  applied to align the Co magnetization.
