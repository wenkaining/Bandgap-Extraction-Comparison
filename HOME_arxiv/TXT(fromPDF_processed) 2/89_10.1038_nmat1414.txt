Defects are known to  modify the electrical resistance of carbon nanotubes4.
They can be present in as- grown carbon nanotubes, but controlling externally their density opens a path  towards the tuning of the nanotube electronic characteristics.
In this work  consecutive Ar+ irradiation doses are applied to single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs)  producing a uniform density of defects.
After each dose, the room temperature  resistance versus SWNT-length [R(L)] along the nanotube is measured.
Our data  show an exponential dependence of R(L) indicating that the system is within the  strong Anderson localization regime.
Theoretical simulations demonstrate that  mainly di-vacancies contribute to the resistance increase induced by irradiation and  that just a 0.03% of di-vacancies produces an increase of three orders of magnitude  in the resistance of a 400 nm SWNT length.
The traditional approximation to reduce the size and enhance the performance  of electronic devices may not be applicable in the near future5.
Electronic circuits  based on molecules have created great expectation for their new foresighted  properties.
For the case of electronic circuits based on carbon nanotubes6, the  influence of disorder and defects4,7 is of fundamental relevance in the performance  of the device.
In particular, the density of defects would determine the transport in  nanotubes from a ballistic regime8,9 to either weak or strong localization regimes.
Quantum theory dictates that for a one dimensional conductor of length L10,11, with  a given density of defects, localization effects emerge when the “phase coherence  length” Lφ is larger than the localization length L0.
If L is not too large (for L about  3-10 L0) and the inelastic interaction is weak, the wire resistance is controlled by the  phase-coherent electron propagation12, falling into the strong localization regime inwhich the resistance increases exponentially with the length of the wire.
This  regime has not been observed in single-walled nanotubes in spite of the many  evidences for weak localization diffusive regime and quantum interference in multi- walled carbon nanotubes13.
By changing the density of defects, L0 can be modified  allowing to control the resistance of the one dimensional conductor.
Induced defects have been already used to modify different properties of  carbon nanotubes.
Indeed, electron-beam has been used to create in-situ nanotube  junctions14 and to enhance the mechanical response of nanotubes bundles by  creating stable links among the tubes15.
Theoretically, the effects of vacancies16,  topological defects17 and random disorder18,19 on the nanotubes electronic transport  have been investigated.
Surprisingly, a reduced number of experimental results have  been published concerning the transport regime of localization and, to our  knowledge, no experimental evidence of the influence of controllably induced  defects on the variation of the electrical resistance with the length of single-walled  carbon nanotubes has been reported yet20.
In order to study this issue we irradiate  SWNTs with Ar+ ions and measure the electrical characteristics of the same metallic  carbon nanotube, after each irradiation, by using a conductive AFM (Nanotec  Electrónica S.L.) at room temperature.
In addition, the measured low voltage  resistance (LVR) data is theoretically analysed using a combination of density  functional methods and Green’s functions techniques.
A metallic AFM tip was used to measure the current vs. voltage  characteristics (IV) of the nanotubes as a function of the distance between the  metallic AFM tip, used as mobile electrode, and a fixed macroscopic gold  electrode21.
Briefly, the experiments were performed as follows: a metallic SWNT  was first selected (Fig. 1a) and electrically characterized.
From the IVs the LVR was  determined along the tube by fitting a straight line to the data around zero volts.
In  this way a resistance vs. length curve R(L) is obtained (Fig. 1a).
The experimental  set up enables us to increase the force applied by the mobile electrode to the SWNT  until an optimum contact resistance is reached22.
All the individual metallic SWNTs probed in our experiments exhibit a non- linear R(L) at low voltage as expected for a strong Anderson localization regime10.
The low-bias resistance data can be fitted by:                                       ) / exp( 2 1 ) ( 0 0 L L R R L R c + =          (1)  where Rc is the contact resistance, R0 is the inverse of the quantum of conductance  G0=2e2/h (the 1/2 factor in equation (1) accounts for the two conductance channels  of a metallic SWNT, see below) and L0 is the localization length.
The exponential  resistance comes from an interference effect by coherent backscattering of electronsat the defects.
Fig. 1b shows R(L) for the selected nanotube before ion irradiation.
This 1.4 nm diameter SWNT exhibits metallic IV characteristics, compatible with a  (10,10) armchair nanotube.
The furthest IV curve was acquired at a distance of ∼700  nm (the uncover length of the nanotube) from the gold electrode.
The closest one is  taken at the minimum distance for which the tip is clearly not in contact with the  gold electrode i.e. 50 nm.
Rc= R(0) is linearly extrapolated from the closest electrode  measurements to be 50 KΩ.
This is a typical contact resistance for individual  SWNTs using gold contacts8.
By fitting the data to equation (1), a value of L0= 216  nm is found.
Repeating the measurements along the same nanotube we obtain the  same L0 within a 5% error, indicating that the AFM tip does not introduce any  measurable damage along the SWNT.
In the case of 14 different metallic SWNTs  we find an average localization length L0=231 nm with a standard deviation of ±117  nm (see Fig. 1 for different R(L) set of data in three different nanotubes).
We have  examined nanotubes from two different sources, HipCo (Carbon nanotechnologies )  and arc-discharged (M.T. Martinez group at  Instituto de Carboquimica, Zaragoza,  Spain) and both presented similar features, indicating that defect control in SWNT  synthesis is still an issue.
High-quality metallic carbon nanotubes grown by carbon  vapour deposition exhibit very long low-bias mean-free-path as large as one micron,  the resistance being controlled by the weak scattering with acoustic phonons8,9.
However, as the scope of the present work is to assess the dependence of the  localization length in metallic carbon nanotubes on defect concentration and tube- length, the quality of the initial nanotubes sample is not relevant.
After this first characterization, the nanotube sample was irradiated with an  Ar+ ion beam with energy of 120 eV (see methods section for details).
After each  ion dose the same nanotube is again electrically characterized finding a decrease in  the localization length from 216 nm, before irradiation, to 61 nm for the 4th dose (the  data are summarised in Fig. 2a).
Notice that this drop in the localization length  causes a change in resistance for L=400nm of about two orders of magnitude.
Further irradiation doses (not shown) produced even higher resistances at this point.
Taking into account the ionic current, the sample area, the irradiation time, the  energy and assuming a (10,10) nanotube, the number of Ar+ ions colliding per  SWNT nanometer length can be estimated (see table in Fig. 4c).
This estimation is  corrected by a factor 1.3 when the trajectories of the Ar+ ions for the experimental  electrode geometry are simulated (SIMION 3D 7.0).
In addition to the increment on  the LVR of the SWNT, Fig 2a also shows a small increment of the contact resistance  with the irradiation time that we attribute to the sputtering of gold and carbon atoms  along the nanotube-electrode contact region.
Using molecular dynamic simulations, Krasheninnikov et al.23 suggested that  Ar+ collisions mainly create mono-vacancies and di-vacancies along the nanotube.
In particular, their simulations for a 120 eV Ar+ ion beam impinging perpendicular  to the tube axis of a (10,10) nanotube show that di-vacancies appear in about 30- 40% of the impacts (private communication).
This is important for the rational  behind the observation of the strong localization regime and in quantitative  agreement with the estimations from our experiments, as discussed below.
In this work we have performed simulations using a first-principles Local  Orbital Density Functional method24 to calculate the relaxation around the defects  and the effective Local Orbital Hamiltonian (a sp3-basis set of FIREBALL orbitals  was used with a cut-off radius of 2.15Å ).
The advantage of this approach is that it  provides a means of calculating the LVR using standard Green-function techniques  derived for tight-binding Hamiltonians25 but now with first-principles accuracy.
Within this theoretical framework, as explained in the methods section, we are able  to calculate the differential conductance g for a realistic tube with a given number of  defects (mono-vacancies or di-vacancies) that are randomly distributed along the  nanotube (Fig. 3a).
This numerical tool allows us to make a quantitative comparison  between theory and experiments.
Before discussing the behaviour of long tubes it is worth discussing the low- bias conductance drop associated with a single defect (either mono-vacancy or di- vacancy) at zero temperature.
A perfect (10,10) metallic SWNT presents a  conductance of 2G0.
Our calculations show a conductance of 1.98 G0 for the mono- vacancy and 1.36 G0 for the lateral di-vacancy (see inset in Fig. 3b).
Clearly, the  mono-vacancy represents a very small scattering to the electron propagation along  the nanotube compared with the di-vacancy.
This already suggests that we can safely  neglect the mono-vacancy effect on the final low-bias conductance and concentrate  on analysing the di-vacancies (this is confirmed by extensive calculations including  mono- and di-vacancies that are not presented here).
Fig. 3b portrays the nanotube LVR at zero temperature calculated as a  function of its length for a mean distance between di-vacancies, d=28.5 nm (the  length of the nanotube can be inferred by just multiplying the number of defects by  d).
Several cases are shown corresponding to different random configurations of di- vacancies; the LVR mean value in the log scale26 is also presented (black line), and  was obtained after averaging over 90 random cases (the grey region in Fig. 3b  represents the mean square root deviation).
Remarkably, an exponential dependence  of the LVR mean value versus length of the nanotubes is clearly present in our  simulations.
This result is general and supports the view that, in the experiments,  Anderson localization is causing the observed increase in resistance.
However, the  strong conductance fluctuations calculated for each configuration (Fig. 3b) are not  seen in our experimental data.
This is due to the energy window of the injected  electrons, of the order of kBT, that introduces significant differences in their phase-coherent propagation along the tube.
If  φ L  is much larger than  0 L  (as it is the case  at low bias in our samples), the condition 0 L LT ≤ , (with  T k v L B F T h = being the  thermal coherent length and vF the Fermi velocity), defines the regime for which the  phase shifts of the electrons (and their corresponding conductances) when travelling  through  0 L  change significantly within the energy window.
Then, the conductance  of each and every single electron does indeed fluctuate with the nanotube length but,  importantly, these fluctuations are different for electrons injected with different  energies.
Therefore, it is expected that the measured conductance, that has the  contribution of a large number of electrons, would not fluctuate yet the exponential  decay in the conductance being still present.
This line of reasoning is corroborated  by our numerical simulations.
In Fig. 3c we illustrate these thermal effects by  showing our calculated LVR at room temperature for two of the random  configurations of defects analyzed in Fig.3b.
Clearly the LVR now presents a  smooth exponential behaviour that is similar (within a 30 % accuracy) to the mean  value found for the random configurations.
The low-bias conductance G (LVR is  just the inverse of G) at room temperature is calculated by integrating the differential  conductance, g, over an energy window defined by the derivative of the Fermi  distribution function (see methods section for details).
The inset in Fig.3c shows g as  a function of electron energy for one of the random configurations containing 25  defects.
The sharp peaks and the strong fluctuations of that conductance are a clear  indication of the strong Anderson localization regime for the electrons propagating  along the nanotube.
For zero temperature, G=g(EF) and then G  is extremely  sensitive to the particular configuration of defects.
However, at room temperature,  the integration over the energy window eliminates the fluctuations in the  conductance (or resistance) as a function of the nanotube length, still yielding an  exponential behaviour in the LVR, in agreement with the qualitative arguments  presented above.
In this paper, we have calculated the LVR using only the mean  value of the conductance for the random configurations at the Fermi level, an  approximation that yields a reasonable accuracy to the LVR at room temperature,  although an improved analysis should incorporate thermal effects for all the  nanotube lengths and all the random configurations (work along this line is in  progress in our lab).
Fig. 4a shows the averaged LVR calculated for different density of defects in  the nanotubes with d ranging from 2.9 to 75.5 nm.
In all cases we observe the strong  localization regime.
To make more evident this localization effect we show in Fig.  4b the calculated values for the localization length, L0, as a function of d.
We get  two distinct regimes: i) for lower defect density (i.e., large values of d, d>5 nm), L0  depends linearly with d, L0≈ 4.1·d.
ii) For higher defect density (small values of d),L0 saturates to a value close to 23 nm.
In our experiments the defect density is  always below 0.15% corresponding to case (i).
In order to compare quantitatively experiments and theory we have to take  into account the initial density of defects (most likely substitutional27) of the  nanotube before irradiation giving rise to the initial localization length (L0)in of 216  nm.
Assuming  that the total localization length is obtained via Mathiessen’s rule as  ( ) [ ] ( ) [ ] ( ) [ ] 1 0 1 0 1 0 − − − + = in defect total L L L  ( (L0)defect being the localization length due to  defects induced upon irradiation), (L0)defect is easily found for each irradiation dose  from the experimental (L0)total obtained using (1).
Once (L0)defect is known from the  experiments it can be compared with the calculated L0.
This allows us estimating the  average distance between di-vacancies, d, for each L0.
If we now compare d with the  estimated number of ion collisions per nm we infer an efficiency of the Ar+ ion  beam of one di-vacancy every four ion collisions, which is in quantitative agreement  with Krasheninnikov et al.23.
The experimental and theoretical results are  summarised in the table shown in Fig. 4c.
These arguments combined with the data presented in Fig. 4 tell us that, due  to localization effects, only 0.03% of di-vacancies produce an increment of three  orders of magnitude in the resistance of a 400 nm length segment of a metallic  nanotube.
This explains why, although the consequences of the presence of defects  in the nanotube electronic transport are so noticeable, we have not observed any  morphological change within the resolution of the AFM in the nanotube structure  under irradiation, even when the tube electrically fails at L = 420 nm in the last  irradiation dose (see Fig. 2 and table in Fig. 4c).
For the sake of completeness it is worth discussing briefly the high voltage  case.
As our experimental IVs were obtained by ramping the voltage from -2.5 eV  up to +2.5 eV, the high voltage resistance (HVR) can also be obtained, allowing us  to assess the influence of defects in the HVR.
This study is of relevance for  nanotube applications as the current carrying capacity of perfect carbon nanotubes is  limited by phonon emission.
In fact, recent measurements 9,12 in high-quality  metallic nanotubes show a very short electron mean free path, 10-30 nm at high bias  due to scattering with optical phonons 28.
From the point of view of the electron  propagating along the wire, the main effect of a high voltage is to substantially  increase its electron-phonon inelastic scattering which tends to favour a diffusive  conductivity in the sample.
This is seen in our experiments for voltages higher than  0.3 eV: in this limit, the nanowire resistance shows a linear dependence versus  length, instead of the exponential behaviour found at low bias, confirming the  change in the conductance regime.
A set of measured IVs (see Fig. 2b) acquired atthe same spot of a metallic SWNT for different irradiation doses exhibit a LVR≈  0.3·HVR for the SWNT before ion irradiation; as the number of defects grows the  situation is reversed and eventually the experimental data show LVR≈ 3·HVR.
In  this case the HVR is mainly dictated by electron-phonon coupling whereas the LVR  exhibits strong signatures of Anderson localization induced by the defects.
By taking  the measured HVR as a function of the length for each irradiation dose, we can  estimate the mean free path l, as l=R0 L/R (9).
This shows that l  varies from 30  nm before irradiation, in good agreement with electron mean free paths due to the  electron-phonon interaction 9,12, to 12 nm for the highest irradiation dose.
A careful  theoretical analysis is required to better understand these results.
In conclusion, we have shown the extreme importance of defects (in  particular di-vacancies) on the low-bias conducting properties of single-walled  carbon nanotubes irradiated with an Ar+ ion beam.
We have shown that only a  0.03% of di-vacancies produce an increment of three orders of magnitude in the  resistance of a 400 nm carbon nanotube segment.
Numerical simulations indicated  that the irradiation efficiency is of one di-vacancy per every four ions collision.
The  experimental data revealed a room-temperature exponential dependence of the low- bias resistance versus nanotubes length, as expected for a strong Anderson  localization regime.
Our extensive theoretical calculations support this conclusion  and illustrate how the short thermal length at room temperature cancels the  oscillations on the LVR(L).
By comparing the low and high bias resistance we also  observed a cross-over between a defect-controlled transport (low-bias) to phonon- mediated one (at high-bias).
Besides its fundamental relevance, this work opens new  paths to tailor the electrical properties of future nanotube devices using ion  irradiation.
Methods      Experiments The irradiation is performed at an Ar pressure of 1.0 ×10-4 mbar.
The ion  energy used is120 eV. We apply irradiation doses during consecutive periods of 5 or  10 seconds.
A 0.1 µA ionic current is measured on the macroscopic electrode (1.8  cm2 area) where the nanotubes are contacted.
Below 70 eV energy we do not observe any conductance drop in the  irradiated SWNTs.
For doses longer than one minute at 120 eV the resistance of the  irradiated sample is so high that the current flowing through the individual SWNTs  is below our sensitivity (∼0.1 nA).
Theory The simulation geometry consists of a device region with the defected  nanotubes connected to two semi-infinite perfect tubes (S1 and S2) that act as left  and right electrodes (see Fig.3a).
In this approach, the differential conductance g(E)  is calculated at the tube-lead interface S2 from:        [ ] ) ( ˆ ) ( ˆ ˆ ) ( ˆ ˆ ) ( ˆ 4 ) ( 2 22 2 2 E E D T E T E D Tr e E g LL R LL L L A LL ρ ρ π h =   (2)  where Tr represents the trace of the operator in brackets.

For  calculating  R g22 ˆ  we use standard decimation techniques.
LL ρˆ (E) is the density of  states matrix projected onto the right end of the nanotube and is calculated by an  iterative procedure which is started on the side S1 and includes, at each step, a new  layer of the tube.
After N steps, we build the whole tube and their corresponding  retarded and advanced Green’s functions  ) ( ˆ A R LL g  (with the projection of the electronic  states of lead 1 incorporated).
In this way, we can include straightforwardly a  random configuration of defects distributed along the nanotube with a given mean  distance between them (see Fig.3a).

Within this theoretical framework, it is feasible to calculate the low bias  conductance of very long nanotubes (up to several microns long) with an arbitrary  distribution of defects immersed on them.

The cross-over between LVR and HVR is  clearly seen. Figure 3.
Simulated resistance vs. length for a fixed density of defects  There are two possible orientations for the di-vacancies.
We define the orientation of  the di-vacancy as the vector connecting the two missing atoms.
The vertical case  (with its orientation perpendicular to the nanotube direction) is less stable than the  lateral one (with their orientation partially parallel to the tube axis) by 2.0 eV; then  we can safely assume that Ar+-irradiation only creates either mono- or lateral di- vacancies.
Inset in Fig. 3b displays the relaxed geometry of a lateral di-vacancy in a  (10,10) SWNT.
Fig. 3b shows the nanotube resistance as a function of its length for  a mean distance between di-vacancies of 28.5 nm.
Several cases are illustrated  corresponding to different random configurations of  the di-vacancies (see Fig. 3a);  the conductance mean value (thick black line) and the dispersion (dotted lines) are  also shown in Fig. 3b, being obtained after averaging over 90 random cases.
In this  figure, the resistance is shown just after each di-vacancy plane, and the length of the  nanotube is obtained by multiplying the number of defects in the x-axis by the mean  distance between the di-vacancies.
A summary of the results for other defect  concentrations is provided in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4b shows our calculated values of L0 as a function  of d: for large values of d (d >5 nm), L0 approaches 4.1·d; for small values of d, L0  saturates to around 23 nm. c) Summary table showing the relevant figures of  experiment and theory.
The shadowed columns are directly obtained from the  experiments.
The values in the sixth column have been obtained via Mathiessen's  rule from the experimental (L0)total.
The seventh column are the data corresponding  to the average distance between di-vacancies obtained theoretically for the values of  (L0)defect in the sixth column.
