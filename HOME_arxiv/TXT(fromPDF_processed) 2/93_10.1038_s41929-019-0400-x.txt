Here, we  introduce the delafossites PdCrO2, PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 as a new family of electrocatalysts for the HER in  acidic media.
We show that in PdCoO2 the inherently strained Pd metal sublattice acts as a  pseudomorphic template for the growth of a strained (by +2.3%) Pd rich capping layer under reductive  conditions.
The surface modification continuously improves the electrocatalytic activity by  simultaneously increasing the exchange current density j0 from 2 to 5 mA/cm¬≤geo and by reducing the  Tafel slope down to 38 mV/decade, leading to overpotentials ùúÇ10< 15 mV for 10 mA/cm¬≤geo, superior to  bulk platinum.
The greatly improved activity is attributed to the in-situ stabilization of a Œ≤-palladium  hydride phase with drastically enhanced surface catalytic properties with respect to pure or  nanostructured palladium.
These findings illustrate how operando induced electrodissolution can be  used as a top-down design concept for rational surface and property engineering through the strain- stabilized formation of catalytically active phases.3    Introduction   Global warming and the decreasing availability of fossil fuels urge today‚Äôs society to transition to more  sustainable energy sources.
While there is enough solar and wind power to satisfy our needs in terms of  total energy, 1, 2 the available power fluctuates strongly and requires intermediate and long term  storage.
3, 4 One viable option is the storage of the intermittent electrical energy in the form of chemical  fuels such as hydrogen (power-to-X).
Clean hydrogen can be produced by alkaline electrolyzers, which  require constant and high current densities for a stable operation.5 In acidic environments, more  powerful and flexible proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers can be employed that allow for  coupling with fluctuating energy sources such as wind and solar.
6, 7 As the most widely used  electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still platinum, an expensive and scarce  material that is also poisoned easily, research into alternative or modified highly efficient and stable  electrocatalysts under various conditions has been identified as a key goal in energy science.8, 9, 10  Strain effects have been discussed to be at the heart of enhanced intrinsic activities toward several  catalytic reactions including the HER, as predicted and observed for example in Pd overlayers.
11, 12, 13  More recently, the scope of this concept has been widened and the direct strain control in substrate  induced strain effects or in core-shell particles have been effectively used for the HER as well as the  oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19   Here, we report the time evolution of the electrocatalytic activity of the ABO2 delafossites PdCrO2,  PdCoO2, and PtCoO2 for the HER in acidic medium and show how inherent structural strain can be used  to enhance the catalytic efficiency operando.
Since their discovery and the observation of their  unusually high and anisotropic conductivity in 1971, 20, 21, 22 these oxides have attracted renewed interest  recently for their unusual electronic properties, 23, 24 anisotropic thermopower,25 and most recently, for  the discovery of hydrodynamic electron flow occurring in nanostructured PdCoO2.264    A common property of the metallic Pd and Pt based delafossites is an inherently expanded hexagonal  metal sublattice with extended nearest neighbour distances on the A site compared to the pure metals  (2.830 √Ö in PdCoO2 and 2.923 √Ö in PdCrO2 vs. 2.751 √Ö in fcc Pd(111); 2.823 √Ö in PtCoO2 vs. 2.775 √Ö  in  metallic Pt(111)).
20, 21, 22, 24 This sublattice is separated by a layer of edge-sharing MO6 (M = Co, Cr)  octahedra, see Fig. 1 a, which gives rise to anisotropic transport properties.
So far, these and other  delafossite oxides have been reported as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline media.
27, 28, 29, 30 Furthermore, copper- and silver-based delafossites have been reported as photocathodes due  to their large band gap.31, 32, 33, 34 Apart from AgRhO2 and CuCrO2, the stability of these systems appears  to be limited to basic, neutral or non-reductive conditions.
35, 36, 37  In this work, we make use of the intrinsically strained metal sublattices and study the hydrogen  evolution activity of the delafossite oxides PdMO2 (M = Cr, Co) and PtCoO2 for the first time,  investigating the influence of strain on the catalytic activity.
For PdCoO2, our long-term studies reveal a  gradual enhancement of the already excellent water reduction activity of the bulk material over time,  putting the electrocatalytic activity of operando modified PdCoO2 en par with that of the top-of-the- class HER electrocatalyst in acidic medium, platinum.
We elucidate how the charge transfer properties  as well as the high specific activity per surface area evolve, which we attribute to the strain-induced  stabilization of in-situ formed, catalytically highly active Œ≤-palladium hydride (PdHx, x~0.62-0.67).38 Together with an apparent increase in exchange current density, these effects lead to a drastically  reduced overpotential at 10 mA/cm¬≤geo (ùúÇ10) < 15 mV and a Tafel slope of 30-40 mV/decade, enabling  stable operation at current densities of 100 mA/cm¬≤geo with less than 100 mV of applied (uncorrected)  potential.5    Results   Electrochemical characterization.
Polycrystalline powders of the delafossites PdCrO2, PdCoO2 and  PtCoO2 were prepared according to previously reported procedures (for details, see the Method  section).
The crystal structure of the isostructural compounds (space group R-3m) was confirmed by  powder XRD measurements (see Fig. S1) and is schematically displayed for PdCoO2 in Fig. 1 a.20, 39, 40, 41 The crystallite sizes were in the range from 1-3 ¬µm for PdCrO2, 10-30 ¬µm for PtCoO2 and up to 1 mm for  PdCoO2 as evidenced by electron microscopy (see Fig. 2).
These microcrystals were subsequently  pressed into a carbon paste electrode (see Methods for details) to study their activity towards HER in  acidic media.
The analysis was performed in hydrogen saturated 1M H2SO4 by means of cyclic  voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry and ‚Äìamperometry.
The polarization curves in Fig. 1 b-d show  the uncorrected cathodic currents per geometric surface area (in mA/cm¬≤geo) for the first 1000 cycles on  all three materials, which all increase in efficiency in different ways.
After correcting for the series  resistance losses (IR-drop) extracted from impedance measurements before the respective cycles, the  CVs can be fitted to the Tafel equation   Œ∑ = ùëèlog( ùëñ/ùëó0)  with Œ∑ being the overpotential with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while b denotes  the Tafel slope (in mV/decade), which provides insight onto the electrocatalytic processes occurring on  the surface, ùëñ being the current density and ùëó0 the exchange current density, which is a measure of the  intrinsic activity per surface area.42  The activity of all delafossites is very high, requiring an overpotential ùúÇ10 of far less than 100 mV for all  systems.
PdCrO2 initially requires ùúÇ10 of approx.
50 mV (Fig. 1 b and e).
Subsequently, the current  density decreases and stabilizes with increasing cycle number.
PdCoO2 (Fig. 1 c and e) initially also yields  ùúÇ10 at 50 mV vs. RHE for a similar loading and keeps improving for the first 1000 cycles down to6    12(3) mV.
In contrast, PtCoO2 initially shows a lower activity than the Pd based materials and quickly  improves towards comparable activities of PdCoO2 within 30-100 cycles.
Afterwards, it stabilizes at ùúÇ10  around 30-35 mV. Remarkably, the overpotentials of all the materials are very low after some initial  cycles and especially the Co based delafossites outperform most catalysts already after 30 cycles (ùúÇ10 <  40mV), particularly all oxides, in acidic media.
43, 44, 45, 46   To better understand the curious evolution of the overpotential over time, we discriminate between the  effects arising from the intrinsic activity and those induced operando, i.e. during the electrocatalytic  process.
In the first cycles, the cathodic currents are influenced by surface activation or hydrogen  sorption, which is well known for Pt and Pd, respectively.
47, 48 This is clearly visible in the first cycle of  PdCrO2 (Fig. 1 b), where the apparent high activity occurs already at the RHE potential before hydrogen  saturation at the surface is achieved.
In the range of 10-1000 cycles, the catalytic mechanism on the  surface evolves with increasing cycle number and the currents tend to stabilize.
Interestingly, the  overpotential is modified also by the catalytic process itself, which is reflected by the decreasing Tafel  slopes for the Co based materials (Fig. 1f).
The values between 70 and 38 mV/dec suggest a mixture  between a reaction rate limited by the discharge reaction of protons at the surface (128 mV/dec,  Volmer mechanism) and the Volmer-Tafel mechanism (38 mV/dec) where the recombination of  adsorbed hydrogen is rate determining, which is observed after 1000 cycles on PdCoO2.
Pure Pd metal,  which has a high Tafel slope of >100 mV/decade for current densities >1 mA/cm¬≤, is limited by the  Volmer mechanism, in contrast to the delafossites presented herein, see Fig. S2.
42, 49, 50 The observed  evolution of the activity described by ùúÇ10 in the delafossite oxides further appears to be related to the  activity of the catalysts per surface area, ùëó0, (Fig. 1g), which changes as a function of time and parallels  the trends observed for the overpotentials shown in Fig. 1 e.
While ùëó0 tends to slightly decrease for  PdCrO2, it increases for both Co containing materials, indicating an effective increase in the intrinsic  activity or catalytically active area, or both.
The values for ùëó0 evolving with time are all in the range of7    1 mA/cm¬≤ and thus amongst the highest reported to date.
For PdCoO2, ùëó0 of up to 5(1.2) mA/cm¬≤ is even  superior to those observed for both bulk Pt and Pd (2.3 and 0.9 mA/cm¬≤, respectively), as shown in Fig. S2.42, 43, 51 In order to obtain an estimate of the real surface area, impedance measurements were performed to  extract the double layer capacitance CDL, which is proportional to the electrochemical surface area  (ECSA), and the pseudocapacitive contribution CP (see discussion in the SI, section 3 and Fig. S3).
Since  due to their modified surface properties no references for the operando modified delafossites are  available, the same capacitive response factors as for bulk Pd or Pt were assumed (see SI section 3 for  details).
We then obtain an ECSA normalized j0,ECSA of 0.14 mA/cm¬≤ for PdCrO2 and 0.20 mA/cm¬≤ for  (Pd,Pt)CoO2 after 300 cycles (see Fig. S3 for details).
These values are close to dealloyed Pd  nanoparticles without normalization for real surface area (0.18 mA/cm¬≤)52 and reported surface  normalized values of 0.14 mA/cm¬≤ for tensile strained Pd grown on Au or rough Pd surfaces (0.22  mA/cm¬≤).53, 54     Figure 1: Crystal structure of the delafossites and the evolution of the electrochemical activity for HER.

To provide insights into the origin of the currents observed in the electrocatalytic experiments, the  evolution of hydrogen was investigated close to the surface by scanning electrochemical microscopy  (SECM) measurements on PdCoO2 single crystals operando (see Fig. S4 a & b for illustration).
Although  no site dependence could be mapped due to a tip-limited resolution >10 ¬µm, the probing electrode  feedback clearly shows the presence of hydrogen near the sample surface (~10 ¬µm) when the sample is  held at different cathodic sample potentials under weakly acidic conditions.
Cyclic voltammograms  reflecting the reductive SECM tip HER current for different sample potentials show a decrease when the  PdCoO2 sample HER current becomes competitive, and an increase in the hydrogen oxidation current at  oxidative tip potentials (Fig. S4 c).
Temporally, an increase in hydrogen production at the sample could  be evidenced by increasing proton reduction currents at the tip (Fig. S4 d).
This highlights the fact that  pristine samples are HER active and improve over time, even without cycling.
Furthermore, a  comparison of the charge passed through a pre-aged PdCoO2 single crystal (> 1000 cycles), referenced to  a Pt wire, yielded stable Faradaic efficiencies towards hydrogen evolution of > 90%.
In contrast, a pure  Pd wire had a Faradaic efficiency of only 6%, probably due to large amounts of H2 being incorporated  into the Pd lattice, even after long coulometric measurements (see Fig. S5).
50, 51    Surface modification analysis.
Next, to understand the origin of the observed increase in catalytic  activity over time, the modifications on the surface of the delafossites were tracked by analysis of the  electrolyte composition by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP- OES) after the electrocatalytic experiments (see SI Table ST1).
Almost no detectable amounts of Cr in the  electrolyte suggest a high stability of this element in the PdCrO2 surface (<0.08 at% of the Cr amount  present in the electrode), while PtCoO2 showed small amounts of Co in the electrolyte, corresponding to  0.24(3) at% of the electrode element.
No dissolved Pt was evidenced in all cases.
In contrast, PdCoO29    shows increased amounts of Co in the electrolyte, indicating a much faster dissolution of Co, which  progresses at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than Cr dissolution.55 After 1000 cycles, 9.35(90) at%  of the Co has leached out from PdCoO2.
Consequently, we expect the formation of a Pd rich surface layer on PdCoO2.
Indeed, direct evidence of  the surface transformation is obtained by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  on the surfaces of the delafossites after catalysis.
While PdCrO2 does not show any obvious signs of  corrosion (Fig. 2 a-b), the surface of PtCoO2 is slightly modified, which is elucidated by a slight  roughening and accumulation of heavier elements as shown by the back scattered electron (BSE)  detector image (Fig. 2 c-d vs e-f).
In contrast, the surface of PdCoO2 is strongly modified, as shown in Fig. 2 g-l and mirrored by the significant Co dissolution and a stronger change in catalytic properties.
Inspection under an optical microscope (Fig. 2 g-h) reveals a large area surface modification and  roughening.
A more detailed SEM analysis of the surface (Fig. 2 i vs j) shows the formation of a  continuous capping layer with a higher concentration of heavy elements than the pristine, underlying  material.
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps on the modified surface further underline the  enrichment of Pd in this topmost capping layer.
The formation of cracks and nanoparticles within the  capping layer (Fig. 2 j-l) suggests a release of strain still present in the remaining capping structure after  Co and O are dissolved near the surface (vide infra).
These cracks can also be related to potential  dependent hydrogen loading and unloading into the catalysts during electrocatalytic cycling, which  results in dynamically modified lattice parameters.56 Also, small amounts of Pd were found in the  electrolyte after catalysis, which can be explained by partial detachment of the strained capping layer  (Fig. S6 a-c).

To further investigate the surface modification, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to  measure the valence state of the respective components of all three materials before and after catalysis,  as shown in Fig 3.
A detailed discussion including survey spectra (Fig. S7) and peak lists (Tables ST2-5)  can be found in the SI section 8.
In brief, the main elemental lines of all pristine delafossites correspond  well to the literature values.
In the oxygen spectra (Fig. 3 c, f and i), an O 1s signal at 531-532 eV is11    attributed to surface adsorbed oxygen.
After catalysis, the amplitude of the delafossite M-O interaction  peak at 529 eV is slightly lowered relative to the surface O 1s peak in PdCrO2 (Fig. 3c), suggesting  somewhat decreasing binding of Pd and Cr to O at the surface.
For PdCoO2 (Fig. 3 d-f) and PtCoO2 (Fig. 3  g-i), the Co as well as the M-O 1s signals completely disappear after catalysis, with slightly slower  kinetics for PtCoO2 (see Fig. S8), underlining the formation of a Pd(0) or Pt(0) layer on the surface during  catalysis, in agreement with the ICP measurements on Co dissolution.
Summarizing these results, we can  conclude that PdCrO2 remains largely unchanged over the cycling experiments, while PtCoO2 and  PdCoO2 gradually lose Co and are eventually reduced, forming a metallic capping layer of the respective  noble metal.12      Figure 3: XPS spectra of PdCrO2 (a-c), PdCoO2 (d-f) and PtCoO2 (g-i) before (top trace) and after (bottom trace) catalytic cycling  in 1M H2SO4.
While the surface of PdCrO2 remains almost unchanged, the surface of PdCoO2 is transformed into Pd with traces  of oxygen adsorbed to the surface.
For PtCoO2, the behavior is similar and a Pt rich surface is obtained after longer aging.
A  peak list including all signals and their areas as well as the survey and additional spectra are shown in the SI section 8 (Fig. S7-8,  Table ST 2-5).
Capping structure and strain analysis.
Having identified the nature of the surface corrosion process as  the reductive formation of a Pd rich capping layer on PdCoO2, we turn to the question as to why this  process leads to the observed exceptionally high activity towards HER.
To this end, we first used  scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to characterize the structure and elemental13    composition of the pre- and post-catalysis samples at high spatial resolution.
STEM lamellae were  prepared from a PdCoO2 single crystal after short (5 min) and long (hours) chronoamperometric aging at  -100 mV vs. RHE, which both lead to the formation of a capping layer with increasing thickness (see Fig. 2 c-e and S6).
A cross section lamella of a 5 min aged single crystal contains both the capping layer and  the underlying material, as shown in Fig. 4 (see SI section 6 for experimental details and Fig. S 6 for a  lamella prepared after hours of aging).
The Pd capping layer is ca.
30 nm thick and consists of Pd  nanocrystals of 2-10 nm size (Fig. 4 a-d).
Elemental analysis of the capping layer by EDS spectrum  imaging 57 shows that the cap consists primarily of Pd (Fig. 4 e), while the  Co concentration  is below the  detection limit (< 2%).
O is only observed at the surface of the Pd capping layer.
The concentration  profiles are summarized in the right display element of Fig. 4 f.
As shown in Fig. 4 a, the Pd fcc capping  layer grows directly on the PdCoO2 surface, in direct contact to the electrolyte.
There is a sharp  transition between the PdCoO2 crystal and the Pd cap (Fig. 4 b).
The atomic resolution STEM-high angle  annular dark field (HAADF) image of PdCoO2 (Fig. 4 c) is overlaid by the crystal structure along the [11- 20] zone axis.
We observe a preferred orientation of the cap on the PdCoO2 substrate, suggesting quasi- epitaxial growth of the Pd (111) in the c-direction of the bulk PdCoO2 (normal to the hexagonal Pd  sublattice).
Within the cap structure, twin variants of Pd nanocrystals are observed (Fig. 4 d and S9).
Fast  Fourier Transformations (FFT) of the respective cap (Pd fcc) and bulk (PdCoO2) regions reveal only a few  degrees tilt between Pd (111) and PdCoO2 (0003), as shown in Fig. S9 (a and b).
This lends further  evidence that the capping layer grows via leaching of Co and O from the bulk material, while the  hexagonal Pd lattice in PdCoO2 evolves into an fcc Pd lattice with minimal structural reorganization, as  illustrated in Fig. 4 g. To derive the lattice parameter of the Pd nanocrystals, STEM micrographs were  calibrated using the lattice parameters of PdCoO2 from XRD measurements.
Compared to the sharp  reflections of PdCoO2, Pd reflections are broader along the radial and azimuthal axes, corresponding to a  broader range of strain and rotation among Pd nanocrystals.
Analysis of all Pd {111} reflections evidence14    a homogeneous lattice parameter of 3.98 √Ö on average, which proves that the Pd fcc capping layer  shows isotropic tensile strain, even for both twin variants (Fig. S9 c).
Further comparison shows a slightly  smaller lattice parameter at the top 5 nm of the cap than the bottom part (Fig. S9 e-g), suggesting partial  strain relaxation towards the surface, especially for the Pd(111) planes that are parallel to the PdCoO2  surface (Fig. S8, d-g).
This is expected for quasi-epitaxial growth and partial strain release due to cracks.
Nevertheless, the lattice parameters close to the surface are still larger than those of bulk Pd crystals  (3.89 √Ö) 58 or the ones reported for Pd nanoparticles with similar size (approx.
10 nm) that show no  lattice dilatation (see also Fig. S10).59 Only below 3 nm, a comparable lattice parameter has been  reported for pure Pd nanoparticles deposited on carbon.
60 A lattice constant of 3.98 √Ö in the capping  layer corresponds to Pd nearest neighbour distances of 2.815 √Ö in the Pd fcc structure, which is very  close to 2.83 √Ö in the Pd sublattice of PdCoO2 and significantly differs from unstrained Pd (2.75 √Ö).
This  further underlines the relevance of lattice strain in the substrate material, PdCoO2, which is transduced  to the capping layer.

e: Illustration of the Pd fcc structure with the (111) plane corresponding to the hexagonal  Pd sublayers in PdCoO2, which act as a growth template for Pd fcc.
The observations made on PdCoO2 in Fig. 4 agree with ICP measurements of dissolved Co in the  electrolyte and the XPS data (Fig. 3) but further suggest that the continuous dissolution of Co and O  creates a significantly strained Pd-rich capping layer, where the strain is transmitted by the  pseudomorphic growth of Pd(111) on the hexagonal Pd sublattice in PdCoO2.
Pd nanoparticle reference measurements.
Since the particle size and density of surface states of Pd  nanocrystals in the capping layer (2-10 nm) differs from that of bulk Pd, which can affect the catalytic  activity,59, 61 we studied the electrochemical activity of Pd nanoparticles of comparable size (1 ‚Äì 10 nm,  Sciventions) to gauge the effect of the particle morphology and strain on the catalytic activity (see Fig. S10-11).
Rietveld refined XRD measurements of the dried reference nanoparticles revealed an average  lattice constant of 3.90(2) √Ö (see Fig. S10), which fits reported values for bulk Pd (3.89 √Ö) and Pd  nanostructures of 8-10 nm size.59 The lattice constant of the nanoparticles is thus 2% smaller than for  the nanocrystals at the bottom of the Pd capping layer (3.98 √Ö).
Since a comparable surface coverage  and active surface area is difficult to achieve, the catalytic properties of both bulk Pd and the  nanoparticles are best characterized by their Tafel slope, which is only sensitive to the underlying  catalytic process and independent of the actual effective surface area.42 Both the nanoparticles and the  bulk Pd show a similar Tafel slope of ~105 mV/dec (Fig. S11 and S2), which is consistent with the Pd  literature value of 103 mV/dec 49 and relates the surface catalytic process to a rate limiting Volmer  (discharge) reaction.
This value is much larger than the values found for surface modified PdCoO2 in Fig.  1 and S2 (38 to 30 mV/dec), which suggests a rate limiting Volmer-Heyrovsky or -Tafel mechanism (38  and 30mV/dec, respectively).
42, 62 The intrinsic catalytic mechanism of the strained Pd capping layer is  thus different from pure Pd, regardless of particle size or morphology.16      Discussion.
To rationalize the observed tensile strain-induced activity increase in PdCoO2, we first  consider the effect of strain as expected from classical d-band theory, which predicts a correlation  between the position of the metal d-band center with the HER activity.53 The relative energies of the  metal d-band and the antibonding hydrogen ùúé*-orbital directly determine their overlap and, hence,  bonding strength of the H-adsorbate to the metal surface, ŒîGH.63 Following Sabatier‚Äôs principle, the  catalyst ‚Äì substrate interaction should be neither too strong nor too weak such that both adsorption of  the substrate and desorption of the product is facile.
Hence, ŒîGH is used as the most relevant descriptor  of the intrinsic activity for HER, given by a turnover frequency or ùëó0, resulting in a volcano plot, with  optimal catalyst ‚Äì substrate interactions at the top of the volcano.42, 64 Tensile lattice strain in Pd tends  to flatten out the d-bands while upshifting the band center towards the Fermi level, leading to stronger  overlap with the hydrogen ùúé*-orbital and, thus, stronger metal‚ÄîH bonds.12, 65 In fact, growth of a  pseudomorphic Pd layer on a single crystalline substrate with a larger lattice constant has been shown  to increase ŒîGH and thus move tensile strained Pd away from the top of the volcano while decreasing  the exchange current density.
13, 53 Interestingly, we observe the opposite trend, enhancing both ùëó0 and  reducing the Tafel slope.
The observed change in Tafel slope by a factor of almost 3 with respect to bulk  Pd suggests a more fundamental change in the materials surface properties to be at play.
Indeed, tensile  strain positively affects the hydrogen adsorption capacity of Pd and has been described to modify the  potential of hydrogen adsorption in Pd. 53, 66, 67, 68 On the other hand, the different lattice parameters  between hydrogen poor Œ±-Pd and the hydrogen rich Œ≤-phase (sharp transition and discontinuous lattice  parameter transition from 3.89 to 4.02 √Ö) kinetically hinder a phase transformation.
69, 70, 71 Since our  expanded Pd fcc lattice intrinsically shows stable lattice parameters (as probed by TEM after prolonged  ex situ sample storage) close to those of Œ≤-PdHx (3.98 √Ö and 4.02 √Ö, respectively), 71, 72 incorporation of17    hydrogen is expected to be more facile.66 This conjecture rationalizes the corresponding findings on the  Tafel slopes, which indeed show Œ≤-PdHx-like behavior (30-38 mV/dec Tafel slope).
51, 62 To investigate the  possible operando formation of a hydride phase, faster cyclic voltammetry measurements (25 mV/sec  and 100 mV/sec) were recorded after 1000 cycles (Fig. S 12).
With increasing scan rate, a stronger  capacitive contribution is observed.
It is most prominent for PdCoO2, as evidenced by the separation of  the forward and backward scans around the open circuit potential (OCP), and the OCP shifts to more  cathodic potentials for this material (Fig. S12 b, 100mV/s scans).
This indicates, in accordance with the  impedance data presented in Fig. S3, that the capping layer is active for hydrogen adsorption - a well- known phenomenon in Pd metal that forms interstitial hydrides (PdHx).
48, 50, 51 Since the sorption effects  are very fast (~1 s), the transition to Œ≤-PdHx can occur almost immediately once a strained Pd capping  layer has been formed under reductive conditions.
In summary, we have investigated the delafossite oxides PdCrO2, PdCoO2, and PtCoO2 for HER activity in  acidic media for the first time.
In their pristine form these materials outperform most reported  electrocatalysts with respect to their overpotentials required for 10 mA/cm¬≤geo (71(15) mV for PdCrO2,  54(12) mV for PdCoO2, 82(3) mV for PtCoO2 in the first cycles).
The very high activity for HER originates  from a superior intrinsic surface activity, translating into exchange current densities on the order of  mA/cm¬≤ (initially 1.9(8) mA/cm¬≤ for PdCrO2, 2.0(3) mA/cm¬≤ for PdCoO2, 0.57(12) mA/cm¬≤ for PtCoO2),  which are orders of magnitude higher than most HER catalysts besides Pt.
This property is especially  beneficial for HER at small overpotentials, where the effect of activity increase by the Tafel slope does  not yet come into play.
While PdCrO2 is relatively stable under acid HER conditions, the surfaces of  PtCoO2 and especially PdCoO2 corrode over time via the reductive dissolution of Co and O at the surface  near region.
The resulting Pd or Pt enriched capping layers show significantly enhanced activities  compared to the bulk materials: ùëó0 increases by a factor of 2.5 and 3.5 for PdCoO2 and PtCoO2, while the  Tafel slopes decrease from 76(13) to 38(3) mV/dec and from 65(3) to 50(2) mV/dec, respectively.18    In the case of PdCoO2, the tensile strain, which is present in the noble metal sublattice of all these  delafossites, is translated to the Pd fcc capping layer, which grows directly on the underlying bulk  material.
This strain increases the hydrogen adsorption energy as predicted by d-band theory and lowers  the energetic barrier for the formation of a Œ≤-PdHx phase, which otherwise requires a significant lattice  expansion (+3.3%).
This phase transformation entails a change in HER mechanism, shifting the surface  catalytic process away from the rate limiting Volmer-reaction found in Pd towards the more efficient  Volmer-Tafel or Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism.
The resulting material has an overpotential of 12(3) mV  for 10 mA/cm¬≤geo only, hence outperforming even bulk Pt.
The herein presented strain engineering points towards a more general design principle for the rational  activity enhancement in electrocatalysts with inherently strained metal sublattices.
It further suggests  that phase transformations, stabilized by strain, may be key players in determining both metal‚Äî substrate interactions and the intrinsic catalytic activity, and as such, strain-induced phase changes may  complement classical d-band theory as a model to predict catalytic performance.
