The GaAs:MnAs material contains ferromagnetic MnAs nanoparticles  in a GaAs matrix, and acts as a spin injector and a spin detector.
Although the barrier  height of the GaAs/MnAs interface was found to be very small, relatively large  magnetoresistance was observed.
This result shows that by using ballistic transport, we  can realize a large spin valve effect without inserting a high tunnel barrier at the  ferromagnetic metal / semiconductor interface.
PACS numbers: 72.25.Dc, 72.25.Hg, 75.47.Jn, 85.75.-d   1In spintronics applications, metal-based passive devices such as giant  magnetoresistance (GMR) head sensors and magnetic random access memory (MRAM)  have achieved considerable success.
Using the spin degrees of freedom in three-terminal  active semiconductor devices is then a natural extension of spintronics research.
Recently, novel devices such as spin field-effect transistor (spin FET) [1] and spin  metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET) [ 2 ] have been  proposed as new building blocks for future electronics.
Those devices are expected to  have the advantages of non-volatility and low power consumption of magnetic devices,  as well as high-speed operation of semiconductor devices [3].
The most basic operations  of these semiconductor-based spintronic devices require electrical injection of  spin-polarized carriers into a semiconductor channel and detection of them by FM  electrodes, i.e. the spin valve effect in FM / SC / FM hybrid heterostructure.
Unlike the  metal-based spin valves, however, this hybrid spin valve structure has a serious  problem; due to the large conductivity mismatch between ferromagnetic metals and  semiconductors in the diffusive transport regime, the imbalance of injected majority and  minority spins in the semiconductor channel becomes extremely small.
This  “conductivity mismatch” problem has been confirmed in recent theoretical and  experimental studies [4-12].
It has been well established that to overcome this problem a    2tunnel or Schottky barrier has to be inserted at the interface of FM and SC [4-5,13-14].
However, such a high resistance interface is not preferred, because it drastically  decreases the current driving capability when used in active transport devices.
In this letter, we show that by using ballistic transport of spin-polarized  electrons in a SC channel, we can obtain a large spin valve effect without inserting a  high resistance interface.
In the case of ballistic transport, the high resistivity of  semiconductors is no longer relevant, thus the conductivity mismatch problem may not  occur.
Consequently, a ballistic semiconductor spintronic device can utilize both the  non-volatility of magnetic devices and the high-speed operation of semiconductor  devices [15,16].
Indeed, the spin FET and the spin MOSFET are assumed to work under  the ballistic transport regime.
Nevertheless, realization of ballistic transport in FM / SC /  FM spin valve structures has been very challenging.
Firstly, the length of the  semiconductor channel must be shorter than the mean free path of electrons, that is, it  must be a scale of several tens of nanometers or shorter.
Secondly, the interface between  FM and SC must be very smooth and free of disorders to avoid loss of spin selectivity [15,17], thus any surface treatment techniques such as etching or sputtering should be  excluded.
Thirdly, because the bias voltage Vhalf, at which the spin valve ratio is reduced  by half is typically several hundreds of mV, the Schottky barrier at the FM / SC    3interface must be low enough to allow ballistic tunneling of electrons from the  electrodes to the conduction band of the semiconductor spacer with a small bias voltage.
To satisfy these conditions, we have performed epitaxial growth of FM / SC /  FM spin valve structures using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
Figure 1 shows our spin  valve device structure grown on a p+ GaAs(001) substrate.
The structure consists of a  non-doped GaAs semiconductor layer with the thickness of tGaAs = 10 - 30 nm  sandwiched by two ferromagnetic MnAs electrodes.
The bottom electrode is a granular  thin film, in which ferromagnetic MnAs nanoparticles with size of 5 nm in diameter are  embedded in a thin film GaAs matrix (referred to as GaAs:MnAs).
The top electrode is  a 20 nm–thick type-A MnAs thin film [18].
The growth procedure was as follows.
Firstly, we grew a 20 nm-thick Be-doped GaAs buffer layer on a p+GaAs(001) substrate  at 580°C.
After cooling the substrate temperature to 300°C, we grew a 5 nm–thick  Ga0.957Mn0.043As thin film.
Then, the structure was annealed at 580°C for 20 minutes in  the MBE growth chamber, during which phase separation occurred in the GaMnAs  layer and MnAs nanoparticles were formed in the GaAs matrix [19-21].
After that, the  substrate temperature was cooled to 300°C again and a GaAs spacer layer with  thickness of 10 – 30 nm was grown.
Finally, a 20 nm-thick type-A MnAs thin film was  grown at 260°C as a top electrode.
After completing the growth, post growth annealing    4was carried out in the growth chamber at 320°C for 10 minutes to improve the structural  and magnetic properties of the top MnAs film.
By growing the GaAs spacer layer at  300°C, we can suppress diffusion of residual Mn atoms from the GaAs:MnAs electrode  to the GaAs spacer while maintaining high crystal quality of GaAs for ballistic transport.
The GaAs layers grown at 300°C are semi-insulating and show an electron mobility of  1000 cm2/Vs at room temperature, corresponding to the mean free path of 10 nm.
The  ballistic transport of electrons through the 300°C-grown GaAs layer at low temperature  was confirmed by observing the resonant tunneling effect in AlAs / GaAs / AlAs double  barrier diodes with a 300°C-grown GaAs quantum well.
It is worth noting that the overgrowth of high-quality semiconductor layer on  top of a FM layer is very difficult.
The unique GaAs:MnAs electrode in our spin valve,  however, allows the overgrowth of a high-quality and atomically controlled GaAs  semiconductor spacer layer [19-21].
Furthermore, the MnAs nanoparticles have been  shown to work well as a spin injector and a spin detector [21].
Although the crystal  structure of MnAs (NiAs type hexagonal) is different from that of GaAs (zinc-blende),  the interfaces between the electrodes and the GaAs spacer are very smooth, as revealed  by the streaky patterns of the reflection high energy electron diffraction patterns  observed at each layer.
The barrier height between MnAs and GaAs in our spin valve    5structure was found to be very small, as discussed below.
Figures 2 shows the tGaAs dependence of the resistances R of four spin valves  with tGaAs = 10, 15, 20, 30 nm plotted in two ways; (a) log(R)- tGaAs with a bias voltage  V of 1 mV, and (b) R- (tGaAs)2 with V = 50 mV. Assuming direct tunneling of electrons  through the GaAs rectangular-type tunnel barrier as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a) , we  deduce that the barrier height φ < 1 meV from the gradient of the log(R) - tGaAs line by  using the WKB approximation.
This result is surprising but seems consistent with the  fact the Fermi level of MnAs lies above the minimum of the X valley of AlAs  semiconductor in MnAs/GaAs/AlAs/GaAs:MnAs magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) [21].
The conductance across the MnAs/GaAs interface in our samples is comparable or  even better than that of the Co/GaAs interface with φ ~ 10 meV reported recently [22].
With this very small barrier height, electrons can easily transport from the MnAs  electrodes to the conduction band of GaAs by the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling  when the bias is higher (V = 50 mV), as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b).
The FN  tunneling current is given by  3 2 GaAs GaAs 3/2 MnAs 2 GaAs GaAs 8 2 exp 8 3 π φ π φ   = −       t m e m V S I m h t heV ,      (1)  where V is the bias voltage, S is the effective area through which the current flows, h is  the Plank constant, e is the electronic charge,   and   are the effective  MnAs m GaAs m   6electron mass of MnAs and GaAs, respectively.
When eV >>φ, the tGaAs dependence of  the exponential part of equation (1) is weak, thus  / = R V I is proportional to (tGaAs)2.  Figure 2(b) shows that R measured at 50 mV is proportional to (tGaAs)2, revealing the FN  tunneling nature of electron transport.
In Fig. 2(c), we show the conductance (G)–bias  voltage (V) characteristics of the four spin valve devices.
The G–V characteristics are  clearly different from that of a typical Simmons-type tunnel junction with a rectangular  barrier (Ref.
[23]), but can be explained by the FN-tunneling based equation (1).
In the  low bias areas (area I) where the exponential part of equation (1) is smaller than unity,  G non-linearly increases with the increasing bias V.
In the intermediate bias area (area  II), G linearly increases with the increasing V since the exponential part of equation (1)  has reached unity.
Finally, in the high bias area (area III), G increases non-linearly again  with the increasing bias.
The non-linear increase of G in area III can be attributed to the  parallel conduction through the GaAs matrix where MnAs nanoparticles do not exist.
This parallel conduction results in the decrease of spin valve ratios at large bias voltages,  as discussed later.
Figures 3(a)-(d) show the magnetic-field dependence of the resistance of the  spin valve devices measured at 7 K with a bias of 50 mV. The black and red curves are  major and minor loops, respectively.
The major loops are superposition of the    7magnetoresistance (MR) components of the ferromagnetic electrodes (gradual change)  and the spin valve effect (abrupt jumps of resistance).
The hysteresis observed in the  minor loops indicates that the resistance jumps correspond to the magnetization reversal  of the GaAs:MnAs nanoparticles.
If we assume purely diffusive transport of electrons in  the GaAs spacer, we can estimate the spin valve ratio by [6]:    (Spin Valve ratio) =  2 sf 2 MnAs GaAs GaAs GaAs 8      r l P r t ,        (2)  where   is the spin polarization of MnAs,  and   are the products of the  resistivity by the spin diffusion length for MnAs and GaAs, respectively, and  is the  spin-diffusion length of GaAs. Using   = 0.5 (Ref.
[24]),   = 10 P MnAs r GaAs r sf GaAs l l P MnAs GaAs / r r -6,  =  10 µm and  = 10 nm, we get a spin valve ratio of 10 sf GaAs GaAs t -6.
This spin valve ratio  expected for purely diffusive transport is 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that of our  experimental results.
Consequently, the appearance of the spin valve effect of several %  in our structures, even when there is no high tunnel or Schottky barriers at the interfaces,  indicates that the electron transport is ballistic.
Figure 4(a) shows the bias dependence of the spin valve ratio [defined as  (Rmax-RH=0)/RH=0] measured at 7 K, where Rmax is the maximum resistance and RH=0 is  the resistance at zero magnetic field.
The sample with tGaAs = 10 nm has the largest spin  valve ratio with a maximum of 8.2 % when the bias voltage V < 120 mV.
However,    8when V > 120 mV, its spin valve ratio decreases rapidly and becomes smaller than that  of the sample with tGaAs = 30 nm.
This is because when V > 120 mV, the parallel  conduction becomes largest for sample with tGaAs = 10 nm but small for the sample with  tGaAs = 30 nm.
Despite the parallel conduction, the spin valve effect was observed up to  300 mV for all samples in our experiments.
Figure 4(b) shows the temperature  dependence of the spin valve ratios measured with a bias voltage of 50 mV. The spin  valve ratios of all samples decreased with increasing temperature, and disappeared at  about 90 K. In contrast, the MR component (the gradual change of resistance with the  magnetic field sweep) was observed up to room temperature.
The absence of the spin  valve effect at T > 90 K is not due to the temperature dependence of the magnetization  of MnAs, since the tunneling magnetoresistance effect of MnAs / GaAs / AlAs /  GaAs:MnAs (with φ = 5 nm MnAs nanoparticles) MTJs was observed up to room  temperature [25].
The decrease of the spin valve effect with increasing temperature and  its disappearance at T > 90 K are thus a natural manifestation of the electron transport  mechanism in the GaAs channel; when the electron transport changes from ballistic  regime to purely diffusive regime with increasing temperature, the conductivity  mismatch occurs and destroys the spin valve effect.
In conclusion, we have observed relatively large spin valve effect by ballistic    9transport in MnAs / GaAs / GaAs:MnAs hybrid heterostructure, even when the barrier  height of MnAs/GaAs interface is very small.
Our experimental results have shown that  by choosing a proper combination of FM / SC materials and using ballistic transport, we  can obtain a large spin valve effect without using a high resistance interface.
Noting that  the silicon technology node has reached 45 nm, it is expected that the ballistic transport  of electrons in semiconductors can be utilized to make active semiconductor-based spin  devices for future electronics.

Schematic structure of our spin valve devices which consist of MnAs thin film (20 nm)  / GaAs (10-30 nm) / GaAs:MnAs (5 nm) grown on a p+GaAs (001) substrate.    Fig. 2. Transport characteristics of spin valve structures.

The inset shows the band diagram of MnAs / GaAs / GaAs:MnAs for the case  of direct tunneling of electrons through the rectangular-type GaAs tunnel barrier.
The  resistances were measured at 7 K with a bias voltage of 1 mV. The black line shows the fitted  log(R) - tGaAs by WKB approximation.
The gradient of the fitted line reveals an effective  barrier height smaller than 1 meV.  (b) tGaAs dependence of the resistance R of the above four  spin valves plotted as R- (tGaAs)2.
The inset shows the band diagram of MnAs / GaAs /  GaAs:MnAs for the case of FN-tunneling of electrons through the triangular GaAs barrier.
The resistances were measured at 7 K with a bias voltage of 50 mV. The dashed line is a guide  to the eyes.
R is proportional to (tGaAs)2, revealing the FN-tunneling nature of electron  transport across the MnAs / GaAs interfaces.
(c) conductance (G) – bias voltage (V)  characteristics of the four spin valves.
The G – V characteristics are clearly different from that  of a tunnel junction, but can be explained by equation (1).
The G – V characteristics can be    13divided into three areas: area I where the exponential part of equation (1) is smaller than unity  thus G non-linearly increases with the increasing V, area II where the exponential part of  equation (1) approaches unity thus G is proportional to V, and area III where the parallel  conduction through the GaAs matrix leads to non-linear increasing of G with V. The thin solid  line shows the borders of those areas.
Fig. 3. Magnetic-field dependence of the resistance of the spin valve structure with (a) tGaAs =  30 nm. (b) tGaAs = 20 nm. (c) tGaAs = 15 nm. (d) tGaAs = 10 nm.
The resistances were measured  at 7 K with a bias of 50 mV. The magnetic field was applied in plane along the easy  magnetization axis [ 20 1 1 ] of the MnAs thin film, which is parallel to the GaAs[110]  azimuth.
The black and red curves are major and minor loops, respectively.
The major loops  are superposition of the magnetoresistance (MR) components of the ferromagnetic electrodes  (gradual change) and the spin valve effect (abrupt jumps of resistance).
The hysteresis  observed in the minor loops indicates that the resistance jumps correspond to the  magnetization reversal of the GaAs:MnAs nanoclusters.

The spin valve ratios (defined as  (Rmax-RH=0)/RH=0) were measured at 7 K. The sample with tGaAs = 10 nm has the largest spin  valve ratio with a maximum of 8.2 % when the bias voltage V < 120 mV. When V > 120 mV,    14its spin valve ratio decreases rapidly and becomes smaller than that of the sample with tGaAs =  30 nm due to the parallel conduction.
(b) Temperature dependence of the spin valve ratios  measured at a bias voltage of 50 mV. The spin valve ratios decreased with increasing  temperature, and disappeared at 90 K.    15Fig. 1.
