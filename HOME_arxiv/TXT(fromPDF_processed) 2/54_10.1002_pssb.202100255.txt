1      Identical Response of Insulators to Irradiations by Swift Heavy Ions:  Application to Experiments on Gd2Ti2O7  G. Szenes  Department of Materials Physics, Eötvös University,  P.O. Box 32, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary  E-mail: szenes.gyorgy@ttk.elte.hu2          Abstract  Track radii Re induced by swift heavy ions are studied.
The experimental track data are analyzed  in Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore in the range Se=6-54 keV/nm (Se - electronic stopping power) including  irradiations by low and high velocity ions.
The Analytical Thermal Spike Model (ATSM) is  applied whose main features are reviewed.
The track data of Gd2Ti2O7 exhibit scaling features  which mean simple quantitative relationships with track sizes of other insulators controlled only  by a single materials parameter (MP), the melting temperature Tm The Re2-Se track evolution  curve is described in the whole range of Se without the application of any individual fitting  parameter and MPs apart Tm; the threshold for track formation Set=6.1/14.4 keV/nm for E<2  MeV/nucleon and E>8 MeV/nucleon, respectively.
The unique role of Tm is a highly important  limitation for the mechanism of track formation.
The practical consequences of the results are  discussed with respect of the estimation of irradiation parameters.

Introduction  The interaction of energetic ions with solids is being investigated with a continuous  interest which is demonstrated by the numerous theoretical and experimental studies that have  been published in recent years.
Intensive research activity is going on materials with pyrochlore  structure because of their possible applications for the immobilization and disposal of actinides  produced in nuclear plants [1,2].
On the other hand, these materials are very interesting from a  scientific point of view, as well, as they exhibit a high chemical and structural flexibility, and  their structure has a high radiation tolerance [3].
The stability of these solids under irradiation is a key problem for applications.
The  irradiation with high energy heavy ions provides a suitable simulation method for the  investigation with respect of the long-term effect of actinides.
Systematic studies would be  required for making reliable predictions.
However, in spite of the considerable number of  publications only a single pyrochlore Gd2Ti2O7 has been studied systematically in a broad range  of ion energies E and electronic stopping power Se [4,5,6] including track formation, as well.
In this paper, quantitative relationships observed in different insulators between the Re2- Se track evolution curves (Re – track radius) are taken into account.
These were ignored in  previous analyses.
Based on such observations, recently, there is a considerable progress in the  understanding of track formation induced by electronic excitation [7].
Concerning the effects  of materials parameters (MPs) it has been shown that track formation is controlled only by the  melting temperature Tm in a broad range of ion energies [7].
Besides practical aspects, this is of  high theoretical interest as Tm is an equilibrium parameter, nevertheless, it controls a process  under spike conditions.
In this paper, the validity of the model is checked for Gd2Ti2O7.
The ion-induced temperature distribution T(r,t) denotes the increase of the local  temperature T over the irradiation temperature Tir.
It is one of the most important information  characterizing the response of solids to the impact of the projectiles.
Therefore, the reliability  of theories depends on a great extent on the accuracy of the calculation of the temperature.
The  direct comparison with experiments is rather limited in this case and new possibilities are  considered.
An emphasis is made throughout the paper on the demonstration of some common  features of track formation in various solids.
In this respect, the initial value of the track radii  Rin have an exceptional importance as various subsequent processes may destroy the existing  relationship between them.
In this paper, the track evolution is described in Gd2Ti2O7 at low  and high ion velocities, by applying the Analytical Thermal Spike Model (ATSM) [8].
The  results in Gd2Ti2O7 and other insulators are compared and scaling features are demonstrated.4      2.
Theoretical background  The most widely studied irradiation effect is the formation of ion-induced tracks.
It was  first observed in 1959 in mica after exposing to uranium fission fragments [9].
In the following  more than 60 years, the theoretical efforts were concentrated in finding the right mechanism  linking the physical properties of the actual target and the irradiation parameters with the track  size.
However, it was shown later that this could not lead to satisfactory result as there was  found additionally a clear quantitative relationship between track radii induced in different  solids by different ions of different energies [10].
The above results have been incorporated into the ATSM published first in 1995 [8].
In  the ATSM, it is assumed that the Gaussian function is a good approximation for the ion-induced  temperature distribution.
Equations are derived for the threshold value Set for track formation  and for the track evolution function Re2(Se) [8].
When ATSM was applied to track forming  insulators, a simple relationship was observed between track radii measured in different  insulators [7].
According to this relation track radii do not depend on MPs other than Tm.
Track  radii are controlled by the ion-induced temperature distribution.
When a quantitative relation  exists between track radii, there must be a quantitative relation between the induced  temperatures, either.
A systematic study of track formation led to revealing that at the moment of maximum  peak temperature Tp (t = 0) the ion-induced temperature increase ΔT(r,0) is identical in various  insulators for <se>=constant [7].
This universal-type temperature distribution is given by       where <se>= Se/N (N- number density of atoms), f is the efficiency, k is the Boltzmann constant  and w=4.5 nm for insulators.
In insulators, low velocity ions induce larger tracks than high  velocity ions at Se=constant and this is called velocity effect (VE) [11].
In ATSM, the efficiency  f is responsible for VE and f≈0.17 is valid for E>8 MeV/nucleon (HI) and it may change to  f≈0.4 [7] in the range E<2 MeV/nucleon (LO).
Presently, there is no sufficient experimental  information for irradiations within the range 8 MeV/nucleon>E>2 MeV/nucleon and the shape  of the transition of the efficiency between the LO and HI values is not known reliably in this  range.
The presence of the efficiency f in Equation (1) is the demonstration that the deposited  electronic energy is not completely transferred to thermal energy.
Recently, this has been  confirmed by direct experiments on Y3Fe5O12 [12].
The comparison of Equation (1) with the  experiments in insulators leads to the conclusion that the spatial localization of the energy    )1( , w r exp kw 3 s f = )r( 2 2 2 e −    5      deposition in the lattice is characterized by the same value w=4.5 nm whatever is E.
The term  MP is used in the sense of an individual materials property.
Therefore, the common parameters  f and w in Equation (1) are not considered as an MP in insulators, though they are obviously  parameters that are related to materials.
In semiconductors, however, w is an MP.
Recently, the uniform temperature distribution described by Equation (1) was checked  in the analysis of experimental data on electronic sputtering.
Systematic data of 10 solids  (amorphizable and non-amorphizable insulators and semiconductors) were analyzed assuming  a thermal activation mechanism [13].
Excellent agreement was found with the experiments for  all solids in a broad range of Se.
The results confirm the validity of Equation (1) when it claims  that the ion-induced temperature does not depend on MPs.
It was also found that w=constant in  a broad range of induced temperature.
Taking into consideration the high complexity of the processes (extremely high local  charges, temperatures, stresses induced in a narrow space within a very short time) the uniform  behavior is highly unexpected.
Actually, ATSM predicts that the track evolution can be described by the equations [8]   ) 2 ( S 7.2 S for ), S / S ln( w R et e et e 2 2 e  =   )3 ( S 7.2 S for , S 7.2 S w R et e et e 2 2 e  =   ( ) ) 4 ( , f w T T c S 2 ir m et −  =   where  and c are the density and specific heat.
Often the c=3Nk approximation is used in the  equations.
The same equations can be derived from Equation (1) as well.
In the analyses  according to ATSM, a logarithmic function is fitted to the experimental data in the range  Se<2.7Set (see Equation (2)) and w and f are the two parameters of the model derived from this  fit.
In principle w and f are fitting parameters, but due to specific features of this effect they  have the same values for various insulators.
When applying ATSM the above procedure cannot be avoided.
When the value of Set  provided by another source is used in the analysis this necessarily modifies the derived values  of the w and f parameters and in this case Equations (2-4) of ATSM do not describe the track  evolution any more.
In a review of ATSM by Dufour and Toulemonde, such improper action  was made both in the LO and HI ranges [14] and the equations with the derived parameters  were applied to track data measured in Y3Fe5O12.
Earlier the same data had been already6      analyzed by using ATSM correctly [15].
The comparison of the results of the two analyses with  the original experimental data is very instructive.
While the corresponding plot in Ref.[15] show  an excellent agreement with the data, the track sizes calculated in Ref.[14] do not even remind  of the original ones.
There are also several similar elementary problems with this review in  Ref.[14].
It is important that Equations (2-4) are valid for the initial radius Rin of the amorphous  cylindrical volume formed in the thermal spike.
In agreement with the identical temperature  distribution expressed by Equation (1) there is a simple unambiguous quantitative relationship  between these track sizes and also between the Re2-<se> track evolution curves measured in  different insulators.
This has been proven for a number of insulators in which Rin was measured [7,16].
However, in many experiments Rin cannot be estimated because of the fast processes of  recrystallization or phase transformation.
By now, the validity of Equation (1) has been justified  for about 20 insulators.
As originally each one has been selected randomly for the experiment,  it is reasonable assuming that the validity extends to a much higher number of insulators  including those where Rin cannot be measured.
Actually, the validity of the composition  independent, uniform temperature distribution (Equation (1)) must not depend on whether Rin  can be measured by the applied experimental techniques, or cannot.
It is not obvious, what  could be the reason that swift heavy ions induce ΔT(r,0) according to Equation (1) in one group  of insulators, where Rin can be measured while in another group of insulators where Rin cannot  be measured, the same ions would induce a totally different temperature distribution depending  on many MPs.
Much more systematic track data is necessary for the final solution of this  problem.
The problems with any theory are revealed when the predictions are compared with the  experiments.
In this paper such comparison is extended to irradiation experiments on Gd2Ti2O7  and it is shown that the predictions of ATSM are in good agreement with the experiments in a  broad range of E and Se.
This analysis diverges from any previous one on this solid as the track  evolution is described without using any individual fitting parameters and MPs – except Tm.
This is a rather severe condition when the accuracy and the validity of a model is checked. 3.
Experimental data and their analysis  In Ref.5 a detailed experimental and theoretical study is published on track formation  induced by swift heavy ions in Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore.
The samples were irradiated by various  ions of 11.1 MeV/nucleon initial energy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman7      spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for the study of the ion-induced structures.
Bright-field and High- resolution TEM methods were also used.
The samples were made either  by crushing the irradiated specimens or by conventional TEM-specimen preparation, including  polishing and ion milling.
The original depth in the irradiated sample is unknown for either type  of TEM specimens.
It was found that radii measured by TEM correspond to tracks consisting of an  amorphous core and a disordered defect-fluorite shell.
Whereas radii derived from the XRD  maxima are related only to the amorphous track core.
Consequently, track radii derived from  TEM experiments always exceeded the sizes obtained by XRD method at the same values of  Se [5].
Following other studies [5], only TEM results were used in this analysis.
It is a  reasonable decision as there is no individual adjustable parameter in this model.
Therefore, it is  more sensitive to the uncertainties of the experimental data than other models.
For the same  reason, there is always an endeavor to avoid including those data in the analysis for which the  parameters of the model (Tm, f, N) or the experimental conditions (E, Se) are not well defined.
Similarly, those track data could not be used when inhomogeneous track structures were  reported and there was no information about the initial track size.
A practical solution of the  problem is when the measurement of the total track radius is possible as it is close to the initial  amorphous size with Rin.
This was done in Ref.[5] for Gd2Ti2O7 providing a possibility for the  application of ATSM.
A further critical point is that there are no suitable systematic track measurements on  pyrochlores other than Gd2Ti2O7.
Obviously, it is very disadvantageous for the application of  any model, but especially those without individual adjustable parameters when only a single  track size is known.
The uncertainty of the derived parameters is considerably increased in such  cases.
This was the reason that some experimental data had to be ignored.
Though the above limitation reduces the available database, however, the unambiguous  demonstration of a close quantitative relationship between track radii and Equation (1) would  not be possible without such limitations.
In the experiment in Ref.[5], the effect of the ion velocity changes in the 40 m thick  samples as the ion energy varies in the range 11.1 MeV/nucleon<E<2 MeV/nucleon along the  trajectory [5].
While Se≈constant along the trajectory, track radii change by more than 50%  because of the VE.
Different values of Re could be obtained in this experiment depending on  whether the original position of an actual TEM sample was closer to the front side (E=11.1  MeV/nucleon, HI condition) or to the back side (E=2 MeV/nucleon, LO condition) in the thick8      specimen.
Thus, the experimental method led to an additional minimum ±25% error in the track  diameters in Ref.[5].
According to the above considerations, the VE is a source of considerable  uncertainty for track studies in this type of irradiation experiments.
In another experiment, Gd2Ti2O7 was irradiated by 120 MeV U ions [4].
While the  irradiations were performed with HI ions in Ref.[5], all data in Ref.[4] belonged to the low  velocity range with E<2 MeV/nucleon.
Beside monoatomic irradiation by U ions, Gd2Ti2O7  samples were also irradiated by 30 MeV C60 ions that completed the LO data [16].
The  experiments in Refs.[4,5,16] were performed in a broad range of Se (5-54 keV/nm) and E (0.04- 11 MeV/nucleon).
In Figure 1, track radii induced by HI [5] and LO projectiles [4,16] in Gd2Ti2O7 are  shown in a normalized plot where c=3Nk is used.
The internal structure of tracks is ignored  here and the experimental Re radii with amorphous core+defect-fluorite shell structure are used  as discussed above.
In the figure, the solid lines are the predictions according to Equation (2)  with w=4.5 nm f=0.17 for HI irradiations (E>8 MeV/nucleon) and f=0.4 for LO irradiations  (E<2 MeV/nucleon).
Equation (2) is valid for Se<2.7Set and predicts an Re2w2lnSe dependence  in agreement with the experiments.
When Se is higher, Re cannot be directly obtained from  Equation (2) as the maximum radius of the melt is reached at t>0 during the cooling phase [8].
In this case, Equations (3,4) are combined leading to  ( ) ) 5 ( .7.2 S S for T T kN 3 fS 7.2 1 R et e ir m e 2 e  −  = It is remarkable that Equation (5) does not depend on w.
The same is true for Equation (3) as  Equation (4) is always valid in ATSM.
This was not realized in the review in Ref.[14] when the  value of w was estimated using exclusively Equation (3) and ignoring Equation (4).
This led to  a considerable error.9        Figure 1.
Variation of the track size in Gd2Ti2O7 [4,5,16] with the atomic stopping  power <se>; Re and k are the track radius and the Boltzmann constant, w=4.5 nm and Tm=2093  K [6,16] is the melting and Tir the irradiation temperatures.
The irradiation by high velocity  projectiles is denoted by full symbols.
The solid and dashed lines are drawn according to  Equation (2) and Equation (5), respectively, without fitting parameter.
Equation (5) is valid at high values of Se and the dashed curve in Figure 1 was calculated  applying it.
It is emphasized the good agreement between the data (Re/Re≈5%, Se/Se≈5% )  and the theoretical predictions for irradiation by LO ions including C60 irradiation when Se and  E are known accurately [4,16].
The agreement was achieved when Se varied by an order of  magnitude and no individual fitting parameters were used.
This verifies that Equations (2-5)  provide an accurate description of the track evolution in Gd2Ti2O7 that depends only on a single  MP - Tm, and T(r,0) is correctly described by Equation (1) with Gaussian width w that does  not change with E.
The comparison of the track data from Ref.[5] with the predicted HI curve shows lower  than expected uncertainty in the positions of the TEM samples in the thick specimen.
The figure  suggests that except the largest track at Se=40.1 keV/nm, the original positions of the TEM  samples were occasionally in that half of the irradiated specimen which was close to the impact  of the projectile.
The agreement of the predicted curve with the experimental data in the HI  range is satisfactory when the possible consequences of the thick samples in Ref.[5] (leading to10      ±50% uncertainty for Re2) are taken into account.
As the random selection of the TEM samples  along the thickness in Ref.[5] and the existence of VE in Gd2Ti2O7 are without doubts, the  above explanation seems to be reasonable.
Thus this high error is simply the consequence of  VE and it is not related to the estimates using ATSM.
When Equation (1) is applied in Figure 1, fSet=ET is obtained for Re=0 where  ET=3Nkw2(Tm-Tir) is the energy necessary for increasing the maximum temperature of the  spike to Tm.
Estimates for the thresholds are Set=14.4 keV/nm (HI, f=0.17, Tm=2093 K [6,16]  1/ET=0.408 nm/keV) and Set=6.13 keV/nm (LO, f=0.4, 1/ET=0.408 nm/keV).
In Figure 2, the normalized threshold values for track formation <set> are shown for  various insulators.
The comparison of the present results with the data in other insulators in  Figure 2 shows that these estimates for Gd2Ti2O7 nicely fit to the lines in the figure and verify  their reliability.
According to Equation (4) the slope of the line is m=πw2/f in Figure 2 (w=4.5  nm, f=0.17/0.4), which is in excellent quantitative agreement (within 5%) with the experiments.
Figure 2. Variation of the normalized threshold electronic stopping power <set> at low  and high ion velocities; Tm and Tir are the melting and the irradiation temperatures, k is the  Boltzmann constant.
The values for Gd2Ti2O7 are present results.
It is an interesting feature of the plot in Figure 2, that it can be used for estimates of the value  of Set for transformed tracks as well since they cannot skip this stage of formation [15].11      The relationship between track sizes is demonstrated by another plot.
When Equations  (2,4) are combined the result predicts that the Re2-<se> track evolution curves follow the same  lines in an Re2 - f<se>/3kw2(Tm-Tir) plot [7].
In Figure 3, such plot is shown for tracks      Figure 3 Variation of the track size with the atomic stopping power <se>; Re and k are  the track radius and the Boltzmann constant, w=4.5 nm and Tm and Tir are the melting and the  irradiation temperatures.
The lines are drawn according to Equations (2,4).
The tracks were  induced by projectiles with E < 2 MeV/nucleon (LO) and E > 8 MeV/nucleon (HI) (for  references see the text).
induced by HI ions (SrFe12O19 [17], MgFe2O4 [18], NiFe2O4 [19] ZrSiO4 [20], Y2O3 [21]),  together with data induced by LO ions (mica [7], Y3Al5O12 [22], TeO2 [23] , Y3Fe5O12 [11,24],  Al2O3 [15], KTiOPO4 [25], LiNbO3 [26]).
The lines cross the axis at <se>/3kw2(Tm-Tir)=1/f  providing f≈0.4 (LO) and f≈0.17 (HI).
The figure proves that track formation proceeds  identically in these solids including Gd2Ti2O7.
This means that similarly to the plot in Figure 1,  the same description of the track evolution is valid for solids in Figure 3, as well.
It is noted that in Figure 3 the track sizes with highest deviations were measured in  Y3Fe5O12 HI samples having thicknesses typically over 60 µm in the experiments.
These high  deviations are attributed partly to VE along the track length leading to the formation of larger  tracks approaching the backside of the samples.
VE had similar effect also in Gd2Ti2O5 as 40  μm thick samples were irradiated in Ref.[5].12      An unexpected relationship between track radii measured in different insulators is  demonstrated in Figure 4 where the appropriate Re values for Gd2Ti2O7 are also included.
Thus  Gd2Ti2O7 belongs to that group of insulators whose response to swift ion irradiations has  common features.
It is emphasized that the relationship in Figure 4 has been predicted by using ATSM [10].
For deriving this plot, Equations (2,4) were combined and a plot was drawn at  <se>=constant.
Evidently, similar plots can be obtained for other values of <se> as well.
This is  an important evidence supporting ATSM.
Figure 4. Variation of track radii Re with the melting temperature Tm in insulators  irradiated by low (o) (E<2 MeV/nucleon) and high velocity (x) (E>8 MeV/nucleon) ions at  <se>/3k=Se/3Nk=3.42x105 nm2 K and 7.5 ×105 nm2 K, respectively, for track data see [27] (N  – number density of atoms, k –Boltzmann constant, Tir – irradiation temperature).
In the figure,  the solids are listed in the order of decreasing melting temperatures Tm.
The enveloping curve  (r)=Tpexp{-r2/w2} is a fit with w=(4.5 ± 0.3) nm and Tp=2020 ± 60 K [28].
Figure 4 is an unambiguous evidence confirming the validity of the thermal mechanism  of track formation since Tm is the unique controlling parameter of the process.
Actually, it is in  agreement with the assumption of the thermal spike models that amorphous tracks are formed  at T=Tm by the fast cooling and solidification of the melted cylindrical volume along the  trajectory of the projectiles.13      It is emphasized that the original experimental data have a primary significance for any  theory.
In this respect it is highly important that the message of Figure 4 is not modified by any  individual adjustable parameter and other MPs with unreliable values under spike conditions.
It is a remarkably important experimental evidence shown by this plot that MPs apart  Tm (including the heat of fusion) have no effect on the track size.
In the opposite case high  deviations from the enveloping curve would appear.
This is a serious restriction for any  mechanism proposed for the ion induced track formation.
The plot in Figure 4 is a basic element for the understanding of the mechanism of VE.
In this respect, it is important, that the widths of the Gaussian curves are identical for LO and  HI irradiations and only the thermal energy of the spike varies with E.
The common behavior demonstrated in Figures 2-4 is exhibited by about 20 insulators  including Gd2Ti2O5.
This is a rather high number as these solids have not been specially selected  in the original experiments.
Taking into consideration the high complexity of the processes  (extremely high local charges, temperatures, stresses induced in a narrow space within a very  short time) the uniform behavior in Figures 3,4 is highly unexpected.
We note that, previously, track evolution has been already analyzed in Gd2Ti2O7  applying the i-TS model [14] requiring an individual adjustable parameter and the knowledge  of a considerable number of MPs under spike conditions and assuming a superheating scenario [29].
The advantage of the description given by ATSM seems to be without doubt as it is valid  in a broader range of Se with applying only a single MP without any individual fitting parameter. 4. Discussion  4.1.
The role materials parameters  According to the thermal spike philosophy, the most important information is the  accurate description of the ion-induced temperature.
ATSM offers a common solution for  insulators, while it ignores the heat of fusion L and other MPs.
Otherwise, the contribution of  L might affect considerably the temperatures.
In a recent paper [28] this problem was discussed  in details and most of the available systematic experimental track data were analyzed.
The  results confirmed that L might have only a minor effect on track formation.
The present analysis  of track evolution in Gd2Ti2O7 also refutes the usual argument according to which the good  agreement with the experimental track sizes is a sufficient evidence for the validity of a model.
In this case it would not be possible that several models could lead to equally good agreement  with a given set of data, while only one of the proposed models may be valid.
The correct model14      must provide a complete description of the irradiation effect and explain beyond the track sizes  the existing relations between track formation in different solids (e.g. Figures 2-4).
In this paper, the theoretical lines in Figure 1 are drawn in agreement with Equation (1)  which does not contain any contribution of L. As L/ET varies in a broad range in insulators, this  large variation ought to lead to considerable shifts of <set> (crossing of the lines with the X- axis) to higher values in Figure 4.
However, no such deviations can be observed in the figure.
On the other hand, the good agreement with the experiments in a broad range of Se in Figure 1  would not be possible if ignoring L were not correct.
The smooth curve in Figure 3 is also a  strong evidence supporting this conclusion.
The above result concerning L has general consequences but, actually, it leads to  important conclusions for Gd2Ti2O7, as well.
In Ref.[5] Set=11.7 keV/nm is derived for HI  tracks that corresponds to 4.8 in the X-axis in Figure 4.
In the i-TS model, the threshold Set  =11.7 keV/nm contains the energy for heating to Tm and the contribution of the latent heat as  well [30].
Thus, Tm ought to be reached already at about Se≈7.7 keV/nm which corresponds to  7.7x0.408=3.14 on the X-axis in Figure 4.
This is about 50% deviation from the value which is derived based on the common  behavior of insulators demonstrated in Figures 2-4.
The difference is even higher for LO  irradiation as only Set≈3 keV/nm is estimated in Ref.[16].
Thus, the induced temperature would  reach Tm at about Se=2 keV/nm, that is even a much lower value.
Consequently, the ion-induced  temperatures are much overestimated for Gd2Ti2O7 in Ref.[5].
While the experimental data  show a close relationship between Set and Tm in Figure 2, Set is related to a much higher  superheating temperature, Tps>Tm in Ref.[5].
This is the reason that the temperature is supposed  to be raised to Tm at a much lower value of Se in that model.
A possible origin of the discrepancy might be that the estimates for superheating were  made for solids without taking into account the ion-induced transient processes and the highly  damaged structure of the targets.
These specific features may affect considerably the proceeding  of various processes including phase transition.
As the reliable knowledge of the temperature is the basis for any calculation in the spike,  therefore, various estimates made for the irradiated Gd2Ti2O7 are problematic in Ref.[5].
The  same is valid for all those solids whose data are included in Figures 3-4 and similar plots.
It is  important in this respect that while Y3Fe5O12 is an emblematic insulator for i-TS, the most  popular model denying scaling properties of ion-induced tracks [30], nevertheless, its  experimental data fit well to other ones in all those figures which demonstrate the  interdependence of tracks.
This means that the Re2-Se track evolution curve can be calculated15      easily for Y3Fe5O12 and other solids in Figures 3,4 using track data of any other insulator in  these figures.
To do that only Tm values must be known, other MPs are indifferent.
This has  been demonstrated in Ref.[7] and agreement between the calculated and measured values was  found within experimental error.
In the same time, up to 10 MPs are required for the description  of the same tracks in Y3Fe5O12 [30] and Gd2Ti2O7 [5].
However, it remains an open question  whether solutions in Refs.[5,30] can be considered as a complete solution of the problem when  the interdependence of these tracks is not even mentioned.
The possibility of the above quite different two solutions is provided by the fact that the  width of ΔT(r,0) can be checked by track measurements only at a single temperature, T=Tm.
The shape of ΔT(r,0) cannot be controlled at any other temperature.
Thus a great number of  various distributions with the same width at T=Tm satisfy this simple condition and any  deviation from the real distribution at T≠Tm is indifferent for the agreement with experiments.
However, when a quantitative relationship is valid between track radii in different solids, then  the width of ΔT(r,0) is also determined at several temperatures (see Figure 3) thus its shape can  be checked in several points.
These considerations may be useful for a correct understanding  of an agreement between measured and calculated values.
The above results indicate that the correct estimation of the temperature is highly  important and indispensable in cases when a quantitative comparison is possible with  experiments.
The plots in Figures 2-4 and the accurate prediction of the Re2-Se track evolution  curve of Gd2Ti2O7 are sound evidences confirming the validity of Equation (1).
Up to now, the  meaning of these figures have not been discussed and explained during the last 15 years using  any other model.
Thus the readers have no information how the various models comply with  the new experimental limitations.
We see that some important features of track formation can be obtained directly from  Equation (1) and Figures 2-4.
Evidently, the specific features of the amorphous track core +  disordered shell with defect-fluorite structure in Gd2Ti2O7 cannot be derived from Equation (1).
This is a very complex nanostructural problem [5].
Its discussion is beyond the scope of this  paper. 5.
Conclusions  When initial track radii are known in insulators, common scaling features show up and  Tm is the only MP which controls the track size.
These scaling features include i./ <set>(Tm- Tir) in Figure 2 for the threshold atomic stopping power; ii./ common Re2-<se>/(Tm-Tir) track16      evolution curves in Figure 3; iii./ common Re - Tm-Tir Gaussian curve controlled by Tm in Figure  4 connecting track data measured in various solids for <se>=constant.
The validity of the above relations is supported by experimental data on ion-induced  tracks measured in various insulators including Y3Fe5O12.
This is a serious contradiction as this  solid is an emblematic prototype for the i-TS model.
The scaling features are also demonstrated  in Gd2Ti2O7 where the measured Re total track radii with amorphous core+defect-fluorite shell  structure are close to the initial radii.
The experimental Re2 – Se values satisfy the equations of  ATSM for a very broad spectrum of Se (5-54 keV/nm) and E (0.04-11 MeV/nucleon) without  applying any individual fitting parameter and without MPs except Tm. LO and HI tracks in  Gd2Ti2O7 are included in Figure 4 that demonstrates the interdependence of tracks induced in  different insulators when <se>=constant.
The results on Gd2Ti2O7 confirm the validity of Equation (1) claiming that the ion- induced temperature distributions agree quantitatively in numerous insulators for identical  values of <se>.
The estimates of the thresholds for Gd2Ti2O7 are Set=6.13 and 14.4 keV/nm for  LO and HI projectiles, respectively, in agreement with the values derived from the scaling  properties.
The heat of fusion L may have only minor if any effect on the track size.
Thus, the  assumption of the superheating mechanism is not justified by the experiments.
It is a source of  a systematic error in the calculation of the ion-induced temperatures that may exceed even 50%.
