"To obtain sharp spot patterns for nanoscale crystallography studies, we want to suppress the diffraction information between the pri- mary beam and the diffraction beam, and therefore the spread of the diffraction spots should be far smaller than the separation, giving the condition z ≫t. In addition, a homogeneously thin, ﬂat sample without tilt/bending is desirable in order to position a region of interest at the same defocus z.","In addition, a homogeneously thin, ﬂat sample without tilt/bending is desirable in order to position a region of interest at the same defocus z.",36/10.1038/s41467-022-30413-5,"

This aligns with the high-energy shoulder (grey arrow) on the broad EL feature at about 1.670  eV.

"I. INTRODUCTION The introduction of SiGe heterostructures into main-stream Si technology has been identified as a  possible solution to overcome the physical limitations of Si by opening new degrees of freedom via  band structure engineering.1,2 Much work has also been devoted to find the best deposition/fabrication  strategy to apply tensile strain to pure Ge structures in order to reduce the energy difference, ∆   =         −          = 140 meV, between the direct          and indirect            band-gaps,3,4,5 thus favoring  population inversion and eventually lasing.6 A large tensile strain is necessary for enhanced gap  shrinkage and, for the same lattice deformation, biaxial strain is more effective than uniaxial strain,7  possibly due to the larger hydrostatic component which significantly affects the shift of the valence and  conduction band states. According to recent k·p calculations,7 Ge grown along the [001] direction  acquires a direct band gap (i.e. ∆   = 0) at around 1.7 % biaxial strain (hydrostatic strain,    ~ 0.73 %)  or around 4.6 % uniaxial strain (   ~ 0.74 %).","According to recent k·p calculations,7 Ge grown along the [001] direction  acquires a direct band gap (i.e. ∆   = 0) at around 1.7 % biaxial strain (hydrostatic strain,    ~ 0.73 %)  or around 4.6 % uniaxial strain (   ~ 0.74 %).",22/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.115309,"

"The OM method is mainly divided into two categories:[45]  one is based on the apparent color of the samples[24, 30-33] and the other is based on  optical contrast.[34-40] The color-based OM approach requires complex calculations  and depends sensitively on the light source and the substrate.[33] The optical contrast  based approach uses either the optical contrast between the 2D material and the  substrate measured from the images’ RGB channels[38-40] or the wavelength dependent  optical contrast spectra.[34-37] The RGB method faces challenges in determining  precise thickness variations, especially in regions with infinitesimal contrast variation  due to the low spectral resolution provided by the RGB filters.[46] Contrarily, with the  help of the grating, the spectroscopy technique can provide complete information on  the spectral dependence of optical contrast in the visible light band. It is worth noting  that in addition to determining the thickness, the optical contrast spectra can also be  used to study the optical properties of 2D materials, such as the band gap, excitonic  effects, dielectric function and absorption spectra.[47-50] It can further be extended to  detecting strain, interlayer charge transfer, stacking order, and twisted angle of 2D  materials as these factors can affect the electronic band structure.[51-54]  In this work, we introduce a novel method that can successfully combine the  advantages of existing optical techniques to accurately determine the thickness of  TMDCs nanofilms.","It is worth noting  that in addition to determining the thickness, the optical contrast spectra can also be  used to study the optical properties of 2D materials, such as the band gap, excitonic  effects, dielectric function and absorption spectra.[47-50] It can further be extended to  detecting strain, interlayer charge transfer, stacking order, and twisted angle of 2D  materials as these factors can affect the electronic band structure.[51-54]  In this work, we introduce a novel method that can successfully combine the  advantages of existing optical techniques to accurately determine the thickness of  TMDCs nanofilms.",57/10.1007/s12274-022-4418-z,"

"CHIRAL FERMIONS AT HIGH-SYMMETRY MOMENTA AND LARGE FERMI ARCS All the MSGs of the table with point group C4 (i.e. the type IV AFM MSG75.4-MSG81.36, and the type I FM15 MSG75.1-MSG80.29) have only proper symmetries, a consequence of which is that any crystal structure that explicitly breaks all symmetries not included in their MSG must be chiral, i.e. enantiomorphic (the SGs 75-76- 77-78-79-80 are all among the 65 Sohncke space groups with no inversion, no mirror, nor roto-inversion symme- tries [100]).

"Among them, the nonet of J = 4 is split into four groups as Γ1 singlet with E0 −5E2 −100800B6, Γ3 doublet with E0 −5E2 + 80640B6, Γ4 triplet with E0 −5E2 + 5040B6, and Γ5 triplet with E0 −5E2 −25200B6. Note that they are equal to the CEF energies of f 2 states for the case of B0 4 = 0.",Note that they are equal to the CEF energies of f 2 states for the case of B0 4 = 0.,77/10.1016/j.physb.2017.07.064,"
