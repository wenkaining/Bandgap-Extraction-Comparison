3.3 Effect of External Electric Field: On applying perpendicular electric field in the range ± 1 V/Å, the semiconducting heterostructures  show reduction in band gap, however, change in band gap depends strongly on the polarity of the field  e.g positive field reduces the bandgap sharply leading to a transition from semiconductor to metal at  E⊥ = 0.5 V/Å in α-P / H-MoSe2 while negative field firstly increases the band gap to a maximum value  at E⊥ = 0.2 V/Å and then decreases continuously to minimum (Figure 4)."

Particularly, on the application of positive electric field in α-P / ZT- MoSe2   and α-P / SO-MoSe2, the semiconductor-metal contact remains ohmic but the Dirac cone  moves energetically below the valence band edge of α-P making the SHB negative while for negative  fields, the Dirac cone remains at the Fermi level but the Schottky barrier changes from p-type to n- type (Figure 5 and Figure S4 of ESI)."

In case of β-P / T-MoSe2, however, positive field turns the barrier  from n-type to p-type as the valence band edge of β-P becomes closer to the Fermi level while negative  fields of  around  – 1.0 V/Å reduces the barrier height to zero rendering the given heterostructure to  possess ohmic contact."

STM images of α-P containing heterostructures are simulated at  ± 0.5 V  while for β-P  based heterostructures images are obtained at higher bias i.e. ± 1.5 V due to higher  energy gap in the constituent monolayer of phosphorene, so as to  get a better understanding of the  electronic states near the Fermi level."

I. Klimov1 1Chemistry Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545 and 2National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545 (Dated: June 27, 2018) We measure the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, τ, of excitons in colloidal PbSe nanocrystals (NCs) at low temperatures to 270 mK and in high magnetic ﬁelds to 15 T. For all NCs (1.3-2.3 nm radii), τ increases sharply below 10 K but saturates by 500 mK. In contrast to the usual picture of well-separated “bright” and “dark” exciton states (found, e.g., in CdSe NCs), these dynamics ﬁt remarkably well to a system having two exciton states with comparable - but small - oscillator strengths that are separated by only 300-900 µeV. Importantly, magnetic ﬁelds reduce τ below 10 K, consistent with ﬁeld-induced mixing between the two states."

Despite the presence of signiﬁcant anisotropy, these systems show interesting spin dynamics.13 There is another kind of anisotropic Kagome lattice in Rb2Cu3SnF12,14 where the Kagome layer is formed by four exchange couplings and has a spin-gap of 20 K. The pinwheel valence bond solid (VBS) excitations are realized in this anisotropic KHAF system.15 Theoretical predictions also suggest that when the Kagome layer is perturbed with additional exchange couplings such as next-nearest neighbor nnn and diagonal couplings, the system is driven to a novel ordered state from the disordered state of isotropic Kagome layer.16 These predictions prompted us to look for newer S = 1/2, KHAF systems to explore interesting physics associated with the presence of anisotropy and additional couplings."

In pure RS-ZnO, the prominent  peaks are at 12.4 eV and 16 eV. When we replace Zn by Mg in the RS-ZnO crystal, the positions  of the peaks shifts towards higher energy values until all the Zn are replaced by Mg and it is  noted that (for RS-MgO)  the prominent peaks are at 14.2 eV, 16.4 eV and 19.9 eV. It is further  noted that the maximum peak in RS-ZnO is at 16.06 eV, while in RS-MgO it occurs at 19.87 eV.So by increasing Mg concentration in the RS-ZnO crystal, the overall response of the material to  the applied energy field shifts towards higher energy in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum."

In WZ phase, the same trend is observed for the peak values of the extinction coefficient  parallel to the c-axis from 14.84 eV to 17.62 eV while in the perpendicular part it decreases with  the increase in the Mg concentration, from 13.67 eV to 12.20 eV. The anisotropy found in the  parallel and perpendicular parts of the extinction coefficient for WZ-ZnO is in the range 6.8 eV  to 17.5 eV and in WZ-MgO 6.89 eV to 29 eV, while the ternary alloys are isotropic for most of  the energies."
