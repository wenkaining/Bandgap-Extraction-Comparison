"Low Pressures (0-50 GPa) As shown in the previous section, phosphorous has an extremely rich phase diagram of unique complexity; at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature its three most common polymorphs, black-P, red-P and white-P are semiconducting or insulating. While black-P and red-P achieve metalization within a few GPa (estimating the exact value would require calculating corrections to the band-gap beyond DFT), white-P is still insulating at 7 GPa with a band gap of about 1.4 eV. Considering that DFT typically underestimates band gaps in insulators, this implies that white-P cannot be considered a candidate for the superconducting phase, and therefore will not be included in further investigations.","While black-P and red-P achieve metalization within a few GPa (estimating the exact value would require calculating corrections to the band-gap beyond DFT), white-P is still insulating at 7 GPa with a band gap of about 1.4 eV.

"In particular, the idea of practical application of the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect con- sisting in the appearance of a photocurrent or very high photovoltages upon illumination of homogeneous crystals without an inversion center (including ferroelectrics)1 has been discussed since 1970s.2 However, since the quantum yield of this eﬀect was low, the idea was not used in prac- tice. In recent years, the interest to ferroelectric oxides was revitalized due to the appearance of new ideas how to increase the eﬃciency of solar energy converters based on the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect.3,4 The main disadvantage of ferroelectric oxides is their comparatively wide energy gap (∼3 eV), as a result of which they absorb only a small part of solar radiation.","In recent years, the interest to ferroelectric oxides was revitalized due to the appearance of new ideas how to increase the eﬃciency of solar energy converters based on the bulk photovoltaic eﬀect.3,4 The main disadvantage of ferroelectric oxides is their comparatively wide energy gap (∼3 eV), as a result of which they absorb only a small part of solar radiation.",193/10.1134/S106378341708025X,ferroelectric oxides,3,eV,1,1,1
