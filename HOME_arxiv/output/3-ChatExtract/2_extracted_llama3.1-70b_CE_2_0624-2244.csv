The dominant feature in the PL at Vg < 0 is due to  X+. This aligns with the high-energy shoulder (grey arrow) on the broad EL feature at about 1.670  eV. There is also a band of emission from impurity-bound excitons (XI) in the PL which matches  the lower-energy EL feature centered at 1.59 eV.  The finding that X- dominates the EL in Fig. 4a is consistent with the observation that X- has  much stronger PL than the other exciton species (Fig. 4b).,This aligns with the high-energy shoulder (grey arrow) on the broad EL feature at about 1.670  eV.
