switching [435, 438\u2013 440].115 The wide band gaps of many perovskite-inspired materials leads to a low dark resistance, which  is advantageous for achieving a high resistance in the off state.", "The  bromide vacancies have a low activation energy barrier to migration (0.22\u20130.57 eV), and these  vacancies can form a conductive channel bridging the two electrodes, resulting in the

of practical interest for these applications.", "In radiation detectors, the wide band gap of PIMs results in low dark current, which  is important for them to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio,
