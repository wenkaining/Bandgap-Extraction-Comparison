Thermoelectric devices can directly convert waste heat into electricity, which makes them an
important clean energy technology. The underlying materials performance can be evaluated by the
dimensionless ﬁgure of merit ZT. Metal halides are attractive candidates due to their chemical
ﬂexibility and ease of processing; however, the maximum ZT realized (ZT = 0.15) falls far below
the level needed for commercialization (ZT > 1). Using a ﬁrst-principles procedure we assess the
thermoelectric potential of copper halide CsCu2I3, which features 1D Cu–I connectivity. The n-type
crystal is predicted to exhibit a maximum ZT of 2.2 at 600 K along the b-axis. The strong phonon
anharmonicity of this system is shown by locally stable non-centrosymmetric Amm2 structures that
are averaged to form the observed centrosymmetric Cmcm space group. Our work provides insights
into the structure–property relations in metal halide thermoelectrics and suggests a path forward
to engineer higher-performance heat-to-electricity conversion.

INTRODUCTION
Thermoelectric materials – which enable the direct
conversion of waste heat to electricity – have received
great attention as one of the most promising renewable
energy technologies [1]. The performance of thermoelec-
tric materials is evaluated by the dimensionless ﬁgure of
merit, ZT:
ZT =
S2σT
κelec + κlatt
(1)
where S is the Seebeck coeﬃcient, σ is the electrical con-
ductivity, T is the temperature, κelec is the electronic
thermal conductivity, and κlatt is the lattice thermal con-
ductivity (power factor, PF, is deﬁned as S2σ). Due to
the recent progress in calculation methods for electron
(hole) and phonon transport in solid crystals, compu-
tational studies have been made to discover novel com-
pounds that possess a high ZT [2–5].
Although the
trade-oﬀeﬀect between the parameters that control ZT
makes the optimization challenging, search for an in-
trinsically low κlatt material is still crucial to maximize
performance[6]. In other words, high thermoelectric per-
formance requires the phonons to be disrupted like in a
glass but the electrons to have a high mobility like in
crystalline semiconductors (i.e.
phonon-glass electron-
crystal) [7].
A.
Metal halide thermoelectrics
Metal halides have been studied for their uses in vari-
ous applications including solar cells [8, 9], light-emitting
∗yj359@cam.ac.uk; a.walsh@imperial.ac.uk
diodes [10, 11], and memristors [12, 13]. These materials
are also known to have an intrinsically ‘ultra-low’ κlatt
(< 1 W/m·K) [14–16], and several reports have started
to suggest their potential for thermoelectric applications
(Table I).
However, the highest maximum ZT of 0.15 achieved
from a halide perovskite CsSnI3 [18] is far to compete
with top thermoelectric materials such as SnSe whose
maximum ZT is > 2.6 [29]. In addition, studies were
mainly conducted on conventional halide perovskites,
while emerging low-dimensional metal halides have yet
to be explored.
Recently, we reported a high thermo-
electric potential in metal halide Cs3Cu2I5 for the ﬁrst
time where asymmetric heat and charge transport in the
material enables a high maximum ZT of 2.6 at 600 K
[28].
In this article, we present CsCu2I3 as a candidate for
thermoelectric applications on the basis of ﬁrst-principles
predictions.
CsCu2I3 is one of the copper-based low-
dimensional halide compounds where 1D [Cu2I3]– an-
ionic chains are separated by Cs+ cations. By performing
lattice dynamics simulations, we found that heat trans-
port in the material is highly anisotropic where the κlatt
in the ab-plane (perpendicular to the chains) is about
2 times lower than that along the c-axis (chain direc-
tion).
We also conﬁrmed that the experimentally re-
ported Cmcm structure of the material is not dynam-
ically stable but an average of Amm2 structures during
our phonon analysis. Interestingly, electron transport in
the material shows an opposite anisotropy compared to
the phonon transport; electron mobility in the ab-plane
is 1.5 times higher than that along the c-axis. Due to
this unique anisotropy of heat and electron transport in
a single material, we predict that the CsCu2I3 in Amm2
structure reaches a ZT of 2.2 at 600 K along the b-axis,
having potential as a next-generation thermoelectric ma-
terial.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
First-principles thermoelectrics workﬂow
The workﬂow to predict ZT from ﬁrst principles is
shown in Fig. 1.
In principle, this only requires prior
knowledge of a crystal structure and all other properties
can be directly calculated in turn. As the ﬁrst step, the
crystal structure of a compound of interest should be op-
timized to a local minimum in the potential energy sur-
face. If the compound shows imaginary phonon modes,
additional crystal structure optimization and/or anhar-
monic corrections should be applied to obtain dynami-
cally stable structure, so that reliable thermal properties
can be calculated [30]. With the dynamically stable crys-
tal structure, bulk properties can be assessed. Results
from steps 2–4 are given as inputs for calculating carrier
lifetimes and transport properties – S, σ, and κelec (step
5), while lattice thermal conductivity, κlatt is obtained
from anharmonic phonon calculations (steps 6 and 7).
Finally, thermoelectric properties such as ZT and ther-
modynamic eﬃciency (η) are predicted by combining the
outputs from steps 5 and 7. Computational details are
provided in section IV.
B.
Structural analysis
CsCu2I3 has been reported in a Cmcm space group,[31,
32] where 1D [Cu2I3]– anionic chains are separated by
Cs+ cations as shown in Fig. 2. When the experimen-
tally known structure was adopted and optimized, we
found that imaginary phonon modes are persistent across
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (see Fig. 3(a)), which conﬁrms
dynamic structural instability of the Cmcm structure.
(This will be further discussed in section II C). To obtain
a dynamically stable crystal structure, we deformed the
Cmcm structure along the eigenvector of its imaginary
Γ phonon mode, which results in a structural transition
to new lower-symmetry Amm2 phase.
The structural
transition from Cmcm to Amm2 occurs with atomic po-
sitions shifted along the directions indicated by the ar-
rows in Fig. 2(a), (c). Cs and I atoms move within the
b-axis and ab-plane, respectively, while Cu atoms move
along the c-axis. The Cu–I–Cu bond angle for Cmcm
is alternately 71.54 ◦and 71.16 ◦, while polyhedra dis-
tortion in Amm2 results in a bond angle of 61.39 ◦and
81.42 ◦, as shown in Fig. 2(e). In Cmcm, the Cu–I bond
lengths in the [CuI4]3−tetrahedron are of a similar value
(2.62 and 2.61 ˚A, two each), as opposed to the bonds
in Amm2 all having a diﬀerent value (2.66, 2.65, 2.58,
and 2.61 ˚A). Thus, while the crystal system is main-
tained as orthorhombic, the crystal symmetry is lowered
from centrosymmetric Cmcm to non-centrosymmetric
Amm2.
Comparison of the calculated lattice parame-
ters of Cmcm and Amm2, as well as experimental value
from X-ray diﬀraction measurement are provided in Ta-
ble II. The structural transition results in a0 decreasing
0.30 % while b0 increasing 0.84 %, both changes due to the
movement of Cs and I atoms. In contrast, c0 is equiv-
alent in both structures, as the shift of Cu atoms even
out macroscopically. Amm2 has an expanded volume of
0.70 % compared to Cmcm. The elastic and dielectric
tensors calculated from Cmcm and Amm2 phases are
provided in Table S1.3

Dynamic structural instability
The phonon dispersion of Cmcm and Amm2 is illus-
trated together with the atom-projected phonon den-
sity of states (PDOS) in Fig. 3(a), (b), respectively.
While the Materials Project [34] repository, as well
as computational[35] and experimental[33] reports, in-
dicate CsCu2I3 as a Cmcm structure, dynamic struc-
tural instability of Cmcm is evident by the numerous
imaginary modes shown in Fig. 3(a).
The eigenvector
components for the imaginary mode at the Γ-point of
Cmcm are shown by arrows in Fig. 2(a), (c).

plotted on the right side of the phonon dispersion.
ModeMap[36], the corresponding energy as a function
of the distortion amplitude along the eigenvectors illus-
trated in Fig. 2(a), (c) is shown in Fig. 4. A character-
istic double-well potential-energy curve is shown.
The
saddle point corresponds to the Cmcm structure, while
the two wells indicate the lower symmetry Amm2 struc-
ture as a local minimum. Thus, the energy-lowering dis-
tortion causes a structural transition to a ground-state
polymorph, Amm2, with an energy 2.84 meV/atom lower
than Cmcm. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the absence of imag-
inary phonon modes indicates the dynamic stability of
Amm2. Hence, we propose that the previously reported
centrosymmetric Cmcm structure is a macroscopic aver-
age over locally non-centrosymmetric Amm2 structures.
In addition, in the Amm2 structure, a lack of inversion
symmetry causes a spontaneous electric polarization. As
shown in Fig. 2(a), (c), polarization mainly occurs within
the ab-plane by the shift of Cs and I atoms, while minute
polarization along the c-axis corresponds to the move-
ment of Cu atoms. The corresponding piezoelectric ten-
sor of the Amm2 structure is provided in Table S1.
D.
Ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity
Fig. 5 shows the κlatt of Amm2 CsCu2I3, as a func-
tion of temperature along diﬀerent crystallographic di-
rections.
Because CsCu2I3 is experimentally reported
to have a melting point at ∼644 K [33, 37], the tem-
perature range for calculating κlatt as well as transport
and thermoelectric properties discussed later is set up to
600 K. Amm2 shows an unexpectedly low κlatt (i.e. ultra-
low κlatt) of a value under 0.1 W/m·K for all directions
even at 300 K; 0.05, 0.03, and 0.08 W/m·K for the a-, b-,
and c-axes, respectively. The isotropically averaged κlatt

(κavg) at 300 K is 0.05 W/m·K, which is lower than one
of the top thermoelectric materials, SnSe (0.2 W/m·K
at 300 K [38]).
The value is slightly higher compared
to Cs3Cu2I5 (κavg = 0.02 W/m·K at room temperature
(RT) [28]), which was calculated at a similar level of the-
ory. At 600 K, the κlatt values are 0.02 W/m·K along the
a- and b-axes, and 0.04 W/m·K along the c-axis (κavg be-
ing 0.03 W/m·K). The anisotropy of CsCu2I3, having a
higher κlatt along the c-axis, can be ascribed to a weaker
chemical bonding towards the c-axis of the unit cell [39].
It is noteworthy that the c-axis is parallel to the [Cu2I3]−
chains.5

Acoustic
phonon
modes
and
low-frequency
optic
modes act as the primary heat carriers in crystals, mainly
contributing to κlatt. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the low-lying
optic modes of Amm2 are relatively ﬂat, which leads to
low group velocities (vλ), one of the reasons for its ultra-
low κlatt. In addition, the high density of the low-lying
optic modes produces a large number of scattering chan-
nels at this frequency range, causing short phonon life-
times (τλ). Fig. S1 shows avoided crossings of the acous-
tic and low-frequency optic modes at the Γ–Y direction.
Avoided crossing is a characteristic feature shown when
a ‘rattler’ is present in the material [40]. PDOS shown
in Fig. 3(b) indicates that lower-frequency phonon modes
mostly comprise motions of Cs atoms. Thus, we can infer
that Cs atoms behave as the rattler, rattling within the
space between [Cu2I3]−chains. Fig. S2 shows the Cs–I
bonds (total 10), and the broad range of bond lengths be-
ing from 3.81 to 4.21 ˚A contributes to the anharmonicity
of CsCu2I3. This is similar to the origin of anharmonicity
of SnSe [41]. We note that ﬂuctuations between Cmcm
and Amm2 could also contribute to the scattering of the
heat transport, but such higher-order anharmonicity is
not considered here.
To further understand the origins of the ultra-low κlatt
of CsCu2I3, we analyzed the modal contributions to the
net transport (Fig. 6). The net transport, κlatt, is a sum
of the individual phonon modes (λ):
κlatt =
1
NV0
X
λ
κλ =
1
NV0
X
λ
Cλvλ ⊗vλτλ
(2)
where N is the number of unit cells in the crystal (equiv-
alent to the number of wavevectors included in the Bril-
louin zone summation), V0 is the volume of the crystallo-
graphic unit cell, and Cλ is the modal heat capacity. The
frequency spectra of vλ, τλ, and phonon mean free path
(Λλ = vλ ×τλ) at 300 K is shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c), respec-
tively [42]. In the entire frequency range, the majority
of vλ fall within the range between 1 and 103 m/s, and
the fastest modes are seen at the 0–0.2 THz frequency
range.
The fastest modes correspond to the acoustic
phonon bands that are relatively dispersive compared
to the optic modes. The overall spectra is comparable
to (CH3NH3)PbI3 (MAPbI3) [43], a 3D perovskite re-
ported to have a ultra-low κlatt of 0.05 W/m·K at 300 K,
while the fastest modes have a lower vλ in CsCu2I3. In
addition, a number of modes have a very low vλ, from
10−12 to 10−10 m/s, unseen in the vλ spectra of MAPbI3
[43] and Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. These modes correspond to the
low-lying optic modes at the 0.2–2.4 THz frequency range
that are relatively ﬂat. The low vλ attribute to the heavy
elements that constitute CsCu2I3.
τλ mostly falls into the range of 10−1 to 101 ps, while
a number of phonon modes within the 0–0.2 THz fre-
quency range (acoustic phonon modes) have a τλ longer
than 10 ps.
The overall spectra is similar to MAPbI3
[43] and Cs3Cu2I5 [28], while the longest τλ of CsCu2I3
are longer compared to Cs3Cu2I5 (longest being 11 ps).
The combination of a low vλ and τλ leads to the major-
ity of the modes having Λλ shorter than 100 nm, which is
why CsCu2I3 shows an ultra-low κlatt. The low-frequency
modes (acoustic and low-lying optic modes) have a rel-
atively faster vλ and longer τλ resulting in a longer Λλ
compared to the high-frequency modes.
This matches
with the fact that acoustic and low-lying optic modes
are the primary heat carriers.
E.
Electronic structure and transport properties
The electronic band structure of Cmcm and Amm2 is
illustrated in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. Both Cmcm
and Amm2 phases have a direct band gap (Eg) at the
Γ-point, with a Eg value of 3.23 eV and 3.08 eV, respec-
tively. The calculated Eg is similar to the experimental
value estimated from the optical absorption spectrum,
3.49 eV [37]. As shown in Fig. S3, upper valence bands
are dominated by Cu 3d and I 5p orbitals, while lower
conduction bands arise from the hybridization of Cu 4s
and I 5p orbitals. For the conduction band minimum, I
5s contributes more compared to I 5p. Calculation of the
orbitals that comprise band edges are in good agreement
with previous reports [33, 37]. The contribution of Cs or-
bitals on those band edges is negligible, which is the well-
known feature of low dimensional metal halides[44, 45].
The corresponding orbitals are also equivalent to the elec-
tronic band structure of Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. The upper va-
lence band is relatively ﬂat, having a hole eﬀective mass
of 0.83 me at the valence band maximum, while the lower
conduction band is relatively dispersive with an electron
eﬀective mass of 0.31 me at the conduction band mini-
mum.
Conduction band has multiple valleys (Γ-point,
Z-point, and along the S–R and Y–T direction), and the
energy diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and second conduction
band edge is 0.57 eV for Amm2. The dispersive nature6

and multiple valleys lead to a high σ and S, respectively,
suggesting the possibility of CsCu2I3 as a promising n-
type thermoelectric material.
Fig. 8 shows the calculated electron mobility, µ, of
Amm2 as a function of temperature along diﬀerent crys-
tallographic directions at the optimal electron concentra-
tion, ne, (6 × 1018 cm−3) at which thermoelectric prop-
erties are maximized (ne will be further discussed in
Fig. 10(a)). Similar to κlatt, µ is anisotropic, with µ be-
ing lower along the c-axis. The isotropically averaged µ
is 21.4 cm2/V·s at 300 K, which is slightly higher than
the µ of Cs3Cu2I5 [28] (18.2 cm2/V·s at RT). Fig. S4
shows µ of Cmcm and Amm2 by the individual scatter-
ing mechanisms. Acoustic deformation potential (ADP),
ionized impurity (IMP), and polar optical phonon (POP)
scattering mechanisms were considered for both struc-
tures, and for Amm2 (non-centrosymmetric), piezoelec-
tric (PIE) scattering mechanism was considered as well.
µ is limited by POP scattering for both structures, fol-
lowed by IMP and ADP scattering. POP scattering is
dominant in many of the top thermoelectric materials
including SnSe [46] and Cs3Cu2I5 [28]. In Amm2, PIE
scattering has the smallest contribution to the total µ, as
its polarization is minute.
The electronic transport properties – σ, S, PF, and
κelec – of Amm2 as a function of temperature and ne
are shown in Fig. S5. σ and κelec are proportional to ne,
but have an inverse relationship with temperature. On
the other hand, |S| is disproportionate with ne, and in-
creases with temperature. Fig. 9 shows σ, S, PF, and
κelec as a function of temperature along diﬀerent crystal-
lographic directions (ne = 6 × 1018 cm−3). σ, κelec, and
PF is higher along the a- and b-axes, which reﬂects the
anisotropy of µ. |S| is almost equivalent along all axes.
Along the b-axis, the PF goes up to 109.66 µW/m·K2 at
470 K.7

F.
Thermoelectric properties
By combining the phonon and electron transport prop-
erties using Eq. (1), ZT for CsCu2I3 as a function of tem-
perature along diﬀerent crystallographic axes is predicted
(Fig. 9(e)). Due to the anisotropy of σ, κlatt, and κelec,
ZT is also anisotropic, showing a lower value along the
c-axis. At 600 K, it reaches a value of 2.2 along the b-axis,
while the a- and c-axes has a ZT of 1.7 and 0.8, respec-
tively. Notably, a high ZT is obtained at a lower tem-
perature compared to the state-of-the-art thermoelectric
material, n-type SnSe, which has a ZT of 2.0 above 700 K
[47]. The origin of a high ZT is a combination of ultra-
low κlatt and high PF. Fig. 10(a) shows the isotropically
averaged ZT of CsCu2I3 as a function of temperature
and ne. ZT is maximized at ne of 6 × 1018 cm−3, and
the maximum ZT achievable at this condition is 1.5 at
600 K. As mentioned above, the highest ZT from a con-
ventional halide perovskite was only 0.15, so this work
may derive more attention towards CsCu2I3 and other
low-dimensional metal halides.
Thermodynamic eﬃciency, η, of thermoelectric gener-
ators can be calculated by the following equation:
η = TH −TC
TH
p
1 + ZT −1
p
1 + ZT + TC
TH
(3)
where TH and TC are the hot side and cold side tempera-
ture of the generator, respectively. The average ZT (ZT)
is deﬁned as follows:
ZT =
1
(TH −TC)
Z TH
TC
ZTdT
(4)
Using these equations, we plotted η as a function of TH,
while TC is ﬁxed to 200 K (Fig. 10(b)). Maximum η of
13.1 % is achieved when the temperature diﬀerence is
400 K (TH = 400 K), and ZT being 0.8.
The main concern when fabricating CsCu2I3 for ther-
moelectric applications would be whether the optimal
ne could be achieved by doping.
Currently, doping of
perovskite derivatives is underexplored, but below we
address some of the doping strategies that can be im-
plemented.
Similar to the doping approaches of 3D
perovskites, doping in perovskite derivatives could be
achieved either by (1) adding dopant sources to the
precursor solution; (2) post-synthesis solution doping;
and (3) post-synthesis vapor doping [48].
The speciﬁc
methods could be adding atomic dopants, and molecular
dopants by surface doping. In general, the B-site met-
als (Cu for CsCu2I3) mainly contribute to the edge of
the band structure [48] (c.f. Fig. S3). Thus, substituting
Cu+ with +2 charged ions is more likely to produce the
necessary states to tune ne, compared to the doping of
Cs and I.
ZT of CsCu2I3 is relatively low compared to Cs3Cu2I5.
However, it is reported that CsCu2I3 is more stable than
Cs3Cu2I5 when dopants are added, and the unstable
Cs3Cu2I5 decompose and form into CsCu2I3 [49]. Thus,
although a higher optimal ne is required for CsCu2I3
(6×1018 cm−3, compared to 4×1018 cm−3 for Cs3Cu2I5),
it may be achieved more easily.
In addition, whether
this high thermoelectric performance is shown only for
CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5, or from perovskite derivatives
in general requires further investigation.
Through our
initial calculations, copper-based metal halides K2CuX3
and CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br) are also expected to have
a high potential as an n-type thermoelectric material.
Changing the A-site or X-site elements to the ones in
the same group of the periodic table is also worth a try.
Thus, investigating Cs3Cu2X5 and Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl,
Br) as well as RbCu2Y3 (Y = Br, I) could be possible.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we report a new direction for metal
halide thermoelectrics with a predictive study on the
structure, properties, and performance of CsCu2I3.

known Cmcm structure of CsCu2I3 was investigated. We
report a new, ground-state Amm2 structure of CsCu2I3,
and compared its basic bulk properties with Cmcm. The
ultra-low κlatt of Amm2 and its origins were studied in
detail. Additionally, the electronic transport properties
as well as ZT were ﬁrst reported in this work. We pre-
dict that CsCu2I3 is a new promising n-type thermoelec-
tric material, and require further investigations in low-
dimensional metal halides.
The centrosymmetric Cmcm structure is a macro-
scopic average over locally non-centrosymmetric Amm2
structures. The octahedra distortion leads to an energy-
lowering structural transition from Cmcm to Amm2, and
the energy being 2.84 meV/atom lower. The lack of in-8

version symmetry in Amm2 results in a spontaneous lat-
tice polarization mainly within the ab-plane.
Amm2 shows an ultra-low κlatt with κavg at 300 K
being 0.05 W/m·K, and the values being higher along
the c-axis (i.e. anisotropic). The low vλ is due to the
low-frequency optic modes being relatively ﬂat. Avoided
crossings of the acoustic and low-lying optic modes are
shown from the dispersion, which is the cause of short
τλ. Cs atoms between the [Cu2I3]−chains behave as rat-
tlers, and the inequivalent Cs–I bond lengths give rise
to a strong anharmonicity. The structural transition be-
tween Cmcm and Amm2 could also contribute to the
phonon scattering.
The conduction bands of CsCu2I3 is relatively disper-
sive and has multiple valleys, which is the reason for its
high σ and S, respectively, characteristics of a novel n-
type thermoelectric material. POP is the dominant scat-
tering mechanism for both Cmcm and Amm2, and PIE
scattering is also considered in Amm2 because of its lack
of inversion symmetry.
Similar to κlatt, the electronic
properties are also anisotropic (superior along the a- and
b-axes).
The predicted ZT of CsCu2I3 reaches 2.2 at 600 K
along the b-axis (ne = 6 × 1018 cm−3), comparable to
the ZT of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. The
origin of high ZT is a combination of ultra-low κlatt and
high PF. η of 13.1 % is achievable when CsCu2I3 is used
in a thermoelectric generator (TH = 600 K, TC = 200 K).

METHODS
A.
Density functional theory calculations
Calculations of the total energy, electronic band struc-
ture, and inputs for the AMSET package such as the
dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric constants were per-
formed using density functional theory (DFT) within
periodic boundary conditions through the Vienna Ab
Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [50, 51].
Projector
Augmented-Wave (PAW) [52, 53] method was employed
to explicitly treat the valence state of Cs, Cu, and I atoms9

as 9 (5s25p66s1), 17 (2p63d104s1), and 7 (5s25p5) elec-
trons, respectively.
For
structure
optimization,
the
Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof exchange-correlation (xc) functional revised
for solids (PBEsol) [54] was used with a 6 × 6 × 8
Γ-centered k-mesh, a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoﬀ
of 700 eV, and the convergence criteria set to 10−8 eV
and 10−4 eV/˚A for the total energy and atomic forces,
respectively.
The elastic and dielectric constant was
calculated using the ﬁnite-displacement (FD) method
and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT),
respectively. The bulk modulus was calculated using the
Phonopy [55] code by ﬁtting the energy-volume to the
third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [56].
Calculations of the electronic band structure and elec-
tron transport were done using the hybrid DFT func-
tional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06) [57].
Compared to the structure optimization, a denser k-mesh
of 12 × 12 × 16 was used, while the kinetic energy cut-
oﬀwas lowered to 400 eV. The hole and electron eﬀective
mass, m∗, was calculated using the sumo [58] code, which
uses parabolic ﬁtting by the following equation:
1
m∗= ∂2E(k)
∂k2
1
ℏ2
(5)
where E(k) is the band energy as a function of the elec-
tron wavevector k, and ℏis the reduced Plank’s constant.
The electronic band structure calculated above was used
as the input.
B.
Structure distortion
Harmonic level phonon calculations were performed us-
ing the Phonopy [55] code with VASP as the force calcula-
tor. The second-order interatomic force constants (IFCs)
were computed using the supercell FD approach with a
3 × 3 × 3 k-mesh, step size of 0.01 ˚A. A total of 11 dis-
placements for Cmcm and 22 displacements for Amm2
were calculated. A 2 × 2 × 3 supercell of the 12 -atom
unit cell (144 atoms), was employed for both structures.
The ModeMap [36] code was used to compute the dis-
placement of the atoms, uj,l (jth atom in the lth unit
cell), along an imaginary-mode eigenvector, Wλ,j (λ is
the phonon mode), at the Γ-point:
uj,l =
1
√namj
Re
"X
λ
QλWλ,je−iq·rj,l
#
(6)
where mj is the atomic mass, na is the number of atoms
in the supercell used to model the displacement, Qλ is
the distortion amplitude, q is the phonon wavevector,
and rj,l is the atomic position. Post processing was also
performed using the code to map the energy, ∆U(Q), as
a function of Qλ along the given Wλ,j (c.f. Fig. 4). The
ground-state structure, Amm2, was then obtained using
the structure at the energy minimum.
C.
Phonon and electron transport
κlatt calculations were carried out using the Phono3py
[59] code, solving the linearized Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) using the single-mode relaxation-time10
approximation (RTA) (Eq. (2)). The third-order IFCs
were calculated with a FD step size of 0.03 ˚A, and a to-
tal of 5568 displacements were considered in a 48 -atom
unit cell. A q-mesh of 12×12×16 was employed to com-
pute the lattice thermal conductivity.
Graphical anal-
ysis of the modal properties were performed using the
Phonopy-power-tool [42] code. Convergence tests for the
lattice thermal conductivity over q-mesh, and distribu-
tion of force norms for the force sets can be found in
Fig. S6.
Unlike the BoltzTraP [60] code, the AMSET [61] pack-
age uses DFT band structures to solve the BTE without
the constant RTA. The characteristic scattering rate, τe,
is calculated using the Matthiessen’s rule:
1
τe
=
1
τ ADP +
1
τ IMP +

τ POP +
1
τ PIE
(7)
The mode dependent scattering rates, from state |nk⟩to
state |mk + q⟩, is calculated using Fermi’s golden rule:
˜τ −1
nk→mk+q = 2π
ℏ|gnm(k, q)|2δ(εnk −εmk+q)
(8)
where ε is the electron energy, δ is the Dirac delta func-
tion and g is the coupling matrix element. The electron
transport properties were computed by the generalized
transport coeﬃcients:

where α and β denotes Cartesian coordinates, Σαβ(ε) is
the spectral conductivity, εF is the fermi level at a cer-
tain doping concentration and temperature, and f 0 is the
Fermi-Dirac distribution. The properties are obtained as

As mentioned above, the required material parameters
such as the dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric constants,
phonon frequencies, and deformation potential were de-
termined by DFT calculations (Table S1).
As the va-
lence bands are relatively ﬂat, calculations were only
conducted under n-type doping conditions, in the dop-
ing range from 1016 to 1021, and the temperature range
from 200 K to 600 K. The interpolation factor was set to
10 for all AMSET calculations.
Convergence tests for
the electron transport calculations over k-mesh and the
interpolation factor can be found in Fig. S5.
