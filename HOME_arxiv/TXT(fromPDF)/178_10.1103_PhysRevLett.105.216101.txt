When a slightly defective rutile TiO2(110) surface is exposed to O2 at elevated temperatures, the
molecule dissociates at defects, ﬁlling O vacancies (VO) and creating O adatoms (Oad) on Ti5c rows.
The adsorption of molecular O2 at low temperatures has remained controversial. Low-Temperature
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (LT-STM) of O2, dosed on TiO2(110) at a sample temperature of
≈100 K and imaged at 17 K, shows a molecular precursor at VO as a faint change in contrast. The
adsorbed O2 easily dissociates during the STM measurements, and formation of Oad’s at both sides
of the original VO is observed.

The adsorption of oxygen on TiO2 is a fascinating topic
from both an applied and fundamental point of view. Ad-
sorbed oxygen plays a key role in photocatalysis, both
as an electron scavenger and as the oxidative species.
It is important in low-temperature oxidation processes
in heterogeneous catalysis and its eﬀect on conductiv-
ity is central to semiconductor-based gas-sensing. Thus,
much eﬀort has been devoted to understand this inter-
action in detail [1–20], using the rutile TiO2(110) sur-
face [21, 22] as a model system.
On a stoichiometric
TiO2(110) surface O2 only physisorbs and desorbs below
≈75 K [15]. This is in agreement with density functional
theory (DFT)-based calculations that predict that excess
charge, i.e., O-deﬁcient TiO2, is essential for chemisorp-
tion [12, 16, 23]. A slightly-reduced TiO2 sample exhibits
two main kinds of defects in the near-surface region:
O vacancies (VO) at two-fold coordinated, “bridging”
atoms (Obr) and subsurface Ti interstitials (Tiint). How
oxygen adsorbs at room temperature is well-understood
[1, 2, 16]: the molecule dissociates at a VO, ﬁlling the va-
cancy and resulting in an O adatom (Oad) that is singly-
coordinated to a ﬁve-fold coordinated Ti surface atom
(Ti5c).
Recently it has been pointed out that O2 can
also dissociate at subsurface Tiint’s, which results in two
Oad’s located closely to each other at the same Ti5c row
[2]. Oxygen exposure at slightly elevated temperature,
where the Tiint’s are more mobile and can migrate to the
surface, results in re-growth of excess TiOx in various
conﬁgurations [18–20]. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
(STM) has been very helpful in unraveling these details
of the interaction between O2 and defects on TiO2.
What happens at low temperature is less clear, how-
ever.
When O2 is dosed on a cold sample, typi-
cally at a temperature around 100 K, various desorption
techniques—thermal desorption (TPD) as well as stimu-
lated desorption by electrons (ESD) or photons (PSD)—
consistently show the formation of a chemisorbed, molec-
ular precursor [3–7].
The O2 molecule is negatively
charged, likely resembling a peroxide O2−
2
ion, and stim-
ulated desorption is hole-mediated [6–9]. One interest-
ing, and somewhat mysterious aspect of these experi-
ments, however, is the fact that some of this molecu-
lar O2 desorbs at temperatures well above room tem-
perature, ≈400 K [3, 4]. Based on TPD/ESD measure-
ments, Kimmel and Petrik [3] postulated the formation
of a stable O2−
4
species (“tetraoxygen”) that survives up
to these high temperatures without dissociating. To test
this prediction and clarify the situation, STM measure-
ments could be quite useful. So far, however, molecular
oxygen on TiO2 was never directly observed with STM.
Here we report low-temperature (17 K) STM results
of slightly-reduced TiO2(110) surfaces exposed to O2 at
100 K. We provide evidence that O2 is indeed located
at VO’s, and that it is visible in STM as a rather faint
change of the contrast.
The O2 molecule is dissoci-
ated by the STM during the measurements even at the
smallest tunneling currents applied (4 pA). We were also
able to observe the intermediates of O2 dissociation on
TiO2(110).
The experiments were performed on two diﬀerent ru-
tile TiO2(110) crystals, one from CrysTec and the other
one from MTI Corp. Both were cleaned by repeated cy-
cles of sputtering (2 keV Ar+, ﬂuence of 4 × 1016 Ar+
ions per cm2) and annealing (at 1123 and 923 K, re-
spectively), resulting in a surface VO concentration of
≈0.17 ML. Constant current STM measurements have
been performed in a two-chamber Omicron UHV system
with a base pressure below 2 × 10−11 mbar, at sample
temperatures of 17 K (liquid He cooled) or 78 K (liquid
nitrogen cooled). Temperatures of less than 17 K resulted
in unstable tunneling. Positive sample bias voltages be-
tween 1.3 and 2.4 V were used, and tunneling currents
were varied between 0.004 and 0.4 nA. Oxygen dosing
was done by backﬁlling the preparation chamber with a
pressure of 1 × 10−9 mbar.
A series of STM images after dosing 0.045 Langmuirs
(L; 1 L = 10−6 torr s) O2 at 100 K is shown in Fig. 1. It is
well-established that the bright and dark lines in empty-
states STM images correspond to the rows of Ti5c and
bridging oxygen (Obr) atoms, respectively [24], and that2

with a white box. Reference measurements before O2 ad-
sorption showed that an image of that size should contain
120 ± 20 VO’s. In addition to VO’s, bright, round spots
are visible on the Ti5c rows that are clearly identiﬁable
as O adatoms; one of these is marked with a circle in Fig.
1a. Since (almost) each isolated Oad is representative of
an O2 molecule that has dissociated and quenched a VO
[2], the numbers of Oad’s and VO’s should add up to 120,
the initial vacancy concentration (0.17 ML). Even when
counting the Oad’s partly visible in the image, the actual
number, 85, is clearly much less.
The STM image in Fig. 1a is streaky in a few places.
This is seen more clearly in the zoom-in (a1), taken at
the position of the black box. The streaks—emphasized
by arrows in panel a1 of Fig. 1—are associated with the
creation of additional Oad’s, which appear during scan-
ning. Indeed, the number of Oad’s increases in consec-
utive STM scans (Fig. 1b,c). Further inspection of Fig.
1a shows an additional feature: at some positions, two
neighboring bright Ti5c rows appear smeared out and
the Obr row between them appears slightly brighter than
usual [yellow (bright) arrows]. Fig. 2a also shows such an
area; it seems that an additional, but very faint species
sits on the dark Obr rows. The apparent height of these
features is about ≈25 pm as shown by the line proﬁle
(Fig. 1, panel a2), averaged over a few such sites such
as the one marked by the black arrows in Fig. 1a. For
comparison, the Ti5c rows appear 55 pm higher than the
Obr rows.
We will now show that these smeared out features are
indicative of an O2 at a VO. In Fig. 1 they are marked
with yellow (bright) arrows.
Their number decreases
during consecutive scans, while the number of Oad’s in-
creases. There is a clear correlation between the position
of the faint O2 features and the freshly formed Oad’s (dot-
ted circles), each new Oad is located at a Ti5c site next
to an O2 in a previous image.
The STM images in Figs. 1 and 2 show yet another new3
feature: Pairs of bright spots, located at adjacent Ti5c
rows. In Fig. 1, these are marked by ovals. Such pairs of
bean-shaped adatoms, which form occasionally when we
dose the sample to O2 at 100 K, have not been reported
before. (Note that the pairs of Oad’s [2] that form when
O2 reacts with a Tiint at room temperature are located
at the same Ti5c row.) Fig. 2 shows the creation of such
a new adatom pair and its destruction during scanning
with the STM. In Fig. 2a, the smeared out feature (ar-
row) corresponding to an O2 adsorbed at a vacancy site
is still present while the tip scans across it. [The slow
scan direction is +y (up) in all STM images.] When the
tip arrives at the scan line marked at the left edge of Fig.
2a, the Obr row suddently appears much darker and an
adatom materializes on the upper Ti5c row. Fig. 2b also
shows a second, bean-shaped adatom at the opposite side
of the original O2. The upper O adatom disappears in
the next frame in Fig. 2c (arrow at the edge). Adatom
mobility is negligible at 17 K, and inspection of the fur-
ther surroundings shows that this Oad has not jumped
to another location. As soon as the ﬁrst adatom disap-
pears, the remaining one changes from the original bean
shape to the “normal”, symmetric and round shape. A
few similar cases are marked by ovals and half-ovals in
Fig. 1.
DFT-based studies of O2 adsorbed on TiO2(110) con-
sistently predict that an O2−
2
preferentially sits at an VO,
and that the molecule lies ﬂat with its axis perpendicu-
lar to the rows. Ref. [13] reports Tersoﬀ-Hamann plots
of a clean, stoichiometric surface and one with an O2−
2
in a VO. These two plots are remarkably similar to each
other, consistent with the claim that the faint, smeared
out features in our STM images are indeed indicative of
an O2 in such a conﬁguration. If this ﬂat-lying O2 sud-
denly explodes [25], it is conceivable that the resulting
two O’s will land on the Ti5c atoms adjacent to the VO.
This is a metastable situation, however, a ﬁlled VO and
one Oad will be energetically favored. So one of the Oad’s
will migrate back into the now empty VO and ﬁll it up
as shown in the schematics in Fig. 2f. This process can
be induced by the STM tip, as evidenced by the frequent
occurrence of partially imaged bean-shaped Oad’s (e.g.,
Fig. 1a, bottom, and Fig. 2c).
With the STM we can easily distinguish between
an across-the-row, bean-shaped adatom pair that stems
from one O2 molecule and a “pair” of two adatoms that
have formed independently and sit at adjacent positions
on neighboring Ti rows by pure coincidence. For exam-
ple, the pairs pointed out in panels b1 and b2 of Fig.
1, have a marked diﬀerence in shape and brightness. In
the ﬁrst case, the two adatoms are separated by an VO
and in the second case by an Obr. This aﬀects the ap-
parent height (brightness) of the adatoms. Interestingly,
the image contrast of the VO between the two Oad’s is
also altered. The gap between the two Oad’s in Fig. 2b
and panel b1 of Fig. 1, at the location where we ex-
pect the VO, is quite dark. This is in contrast to the
typical appearance of an isolated VO, which is normally
observed as a bright spot on a (dark) Obr row.
The
dark VO in between the newly-formed Oad pair leads
to the bean-shaped appearance alluded to above. The
STM contrast on TiO2 is dominated by electronic eﬀects,
and the appearance of this conﬁguration points towards
a re-arrangement of charge in the vacancy. Based on the
extensive theoretical work of the role of excess charge
in oxygen adsorption it seems also conceivable that the
adatoms in these two cases—either with or without a VO
between them—do not have the same charge.
The experimental results in Figs. 1 and 2 provide ev-
idence that adsorbed molecular O2 is indeed observable
with STM, but they also point to the fact that the species
is very unstable, and that the STM measurement itself is
the trigger for most of the dissociation that is observed.
The results shown here have been taken at 17 K. Addi-
tional STM measurements at 78 K show essentially the
same features, i.e., O2 at VO’s, single Oad’s that sud-
denly appear during scanning, and Oad pairs resulting
from the same O2.
STM-induced dissociation at 78 K
is even more facile than at 17 K, however, and in many
instances most of the dissociation ocurs during the ﬁrst
scan of the image. At either temperature, scanning with
“harsh” conditions (Vsample ≥+2.4 V, I ≥0.35 nA) dis-
sociates all O2’s within one single scan, and the density
of Oad’s and VO’s approximately equates the number of
the original VO’s prior to O2 adsorption. The eﬀect of
the tip is rather localized: when re-scanning a slightly-
shifted area with “milder” conditions, we ﬁnd that the
dissociation occurs within a range of less than ≈1 nm
from the location of the tip.
What causes the facile dissociation of adsorbed oxygen
molecules during the STM scanning? The various mech-
anisms for tip-induced dynamics are discussed in ref. [26].
If an antibonding orbital can be accessed by the tunnel-
ing electrons, then the rate of dissociation should scale
linearly with the tunneling current I. If local heating is
responsible, the rate should scale as In with a higher
value of n.
We ran extensive tests, where we varied
the tunneling current over more than an order of mag-
nitude (0.004 nA to 0.05 nA), but kept all other experi-
mental parameters constant. We chose a tunneling volt-
age of 1.3 V, the lowest value where reproducible images
could be obtained. While we found a large scatter of the
adatom creation range (0.0077 ML/scan, standard devia-
tion 0.0035 ML/scan), the adatom creation rate shows no
correlation with the tunneling current. This clearly rules
out an electron-induced process for the oxygen dissocia-
tion. As we observe at most a weak dependence on the
tunneling current, ignoring van-der-Waals interactions,
the interaction between tip and adsorbed O2 must be due
to the electric ﬁeld, which varies with the distance, and,
hence, the logarithm of the current. As the change of the
shape and composition of the STM tip is not under our4
control, the local ﬁeld under the STM tip also changes,
even when we use the same tunneling voltage, explaining
the scatter of adatom creation rate observed. Hence we
propose that the ﬁeld is the decisive factor in how readily
an adsorbed O2 dissociates. Possibly, the STM tip pushes
the O2 molecule into a conﬁguration that allows an easy
dissociation. Exactly what this conﬁguration might be is
unclear at this point, but we consider it likely that a po-
sition closer to a Ti atom in the substrate will facilitate
dissociation. It should be emphasized, however, that the
product of any tip-induced process can be observed only
when it is (meta)stable on the surface. In other words,
the tip helps overcoming a barrier. We consider it likely
that this process also happens spontaneously at higher
temperatures, and, thus, the observed Oad pairs should
be considered the reaction intermediate of O2 dissocia-
tion at TiO2(110).
Desorption measurements have shown that the disso-
ciation probability of Oad
2 ’s is coverage-dependent, and
that small amounts of O2 (the coverage regime of the
STM measurements shown here) dissociate more easily
than larger coverages [4]. We have varied the O2 expo-
sure in our measurements as well, but we did not ob-
serve any new features or any signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
adatom creation.
Very recent PSD/TPD work [4] has
shown that irradiation with above-band-gap photons not
only desorbs O2 (through hole capture) but also disso-
ciates O2 through an electron-mediated process. In ad-
dition, photon exposure was also reported to create a
“photo-blind”, thermally stable molecular O2 species [4],
which was again attributed to tetraoxygen.
We have
searched for such species by dosing higher amounts of
O2 and irradiating the sample with a UV-light emitting
diode (365 nm, ≈1015 photons cm−2 s−1), but, again, no
evidence could be found for such a species.
To summarize, we have unequivocally observed molec-
ular O2 adsorbed at oxygen vacancies on TiO2 with LT-
STM. Our measurements also show the diﬃculty of using
STM as an analytical tool for learning more about this
species: the STM measurement invariably dissociates the
molecule even at the smallest tunneling currents, albeit
with a probability that is highly tip-dependent. While
it is fascinating to directly observe this dissociation, it is
a nuisance when one wants to learn more about the ad-
sorbed O2 molecule itself. The STM contrast of an O2 in
a VO is so faint that it is easily overlooked in a somewhat
noisier instrument. On the other hand, the creation prob-
ability of the O adatoms is tip-dependent, thus a mere
counting of the adatoms needs to be conducted carefully
to avoid erroneous conclusions.
