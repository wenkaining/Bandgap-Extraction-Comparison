Abstract 
The high strength of structural aluminium alloys depends strongly on the controlled 
precipitation of specific intermetallic phases, whose identity and crystal structure can be 
difficult to predict. Here, we investigate the Al-Pt system, which shows some similarity 
to the Al-Cu system as one of their main intermetallic phases, Al2Pt, is nearly isostructural 
with θ′(Al2Cu), the metastable phase responsible for the high-strength of Al-Cu alloys. 
However, phases in Al-Pt alloys are complex and have not been studied in detail. Using 
a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and classical nucleation 
theory (CNT) applied to the Al-Pt system, we design a workflow to predict the 
thermodynamics of solid solution, intermediate phases such as GP zones, stable and 
metastable precipitates, and their precipitation sequence. This workflow can be applied 
to an arbitrary binary alloying system. We confirm the known stable phases Al4Pt, Al21Pt8, 
Al2Pt, Al3Pt2, AlPt (α & β ), Al3Pt5, AlPt2 (α & β ) and AlPt3 (α & β ). We also reveal the 
possible existence of two phases of chemical formulae Al5Pt and Al3Pt. This large number 
of intermetallic phases is due to the strong bonding between Al and Pt, which also leads 
to significant favourable Pt solute formation energy in the Al matrix. Our findings are 
compared with the known precipitation characteristics of the binary Al-Cu and Al-Au 
systems. We find that the θ′-like Al2Pt precipitate phase has a lower coherent interfacial 
energy than θ′. Our calculations strongly suggest that Al2Pt will precipitate first in Al-
rich Al-Pt alloys and will form bulk-like interfaces similar to η (Al2Au) rather than like 
θ′ (Al2Cu).

Introduction 
Controlled solid-state precipitation is commonly used for achieving significant 
strengthening in light structural alloys. This is because precipitates of appropriate shape, 
distribution, number density and crystallography can constitute effective barriers to the 
movement of dislocations. In general, high-strength alloys require uniformly and densely 
distributed precipitates with high aspect ratios and a rational crystallographic orientation 
[1]. A well-known alloy system containing such precipitates is the Al-Cu system, which 
forms the basis of an important class of engineering alloys for aircraft and aerospace 
applications [2]. In Al-Cu alloys, a fine and uniform precipitation of θ′′ (Al3Cu) and θ′ 
(Al2Cu) precipitates with aspect ratios greater than 50:1 can lead to tensile strength of up 
to 500 MPa [2]. The θ′  phase is metastable and its crystal structure bears little 
resemblance to known bulk phases in the Al-Cu system [3].  More generally, precipitates 
forming in the early stages of precipitation are commonly metastable phases not expected 
to form based on the bulk phase diagram (e.g., η′ (AlCu) in Al-Cu alloys [4]) or they 
exhibit distorted structures of known bulk phases (e.g. Ω phase in Al-Cu alloys [5]). 
Consequently, predicting the early stages of precipitation in a given alloy system through 
atomic-scale modelling rather than in ad-hoc and empirical way, is a very challenging 
task. Yet this endeavour is of great importance for discovering and enhancing the 
properties of structural Al alloys. This challenge has motivated us to investigate the solid-
state precipitation in the Al-rich part of the Al-Pt alloy system using advanced atomistic 
simulation methods. 
In the periodic table, Pt sits next to the column of Cu and Au, and shares their 
cubic close-packed structure. The Al-Pt system exhibits several features that should make3 
it interesting to compare with better known Al-Cu and Al-Au binary alloys containing 
plate-shaped precipitates. Firstly, among all Al binary alloys, the Al2Pt phase is the only 
stable θ′-like intermetallic phase besides η  (Al2Au) [6]. Secondly, several gaps remain 
in our knowledge of the precipitation characteristics of Pt-containing aluminium alloys. 
The latest research on the Al-Pt system indicates the following phases to be stable: Al4Pt, 
Al21Pt8, Al2Pt, Al3Pt2, AlPt (α & β ), Al3Pt5, AlPt2 (α & β ) and AlPt3 (α & β ) [7-9]. Here, 
α is the low-temperature polymorph and β is the high-temperature one—see Table 1 for 
details. Al2Pt has a cubic CaF2-type structure with 𝑎𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡= 5.91 Å [10], which is similar 
to the crystal structure of  θ′ (Al2Cu) [3] when viewed along <110> as shown in Figure 
1. There remain many unknowns regarding the Al-Pt alloy system: recent experimental 
and computational studies have focused on the determination of bulk intermetallic phases 
[7, 8, 11-13] and their applications [14, 15], but have not addressed the thermodynamics 
of solid solution, precipitate interfacial structures and precipitation sequences. One 
particularly intriguing feature of the Al-Pt binary system is the existence of several stable 
and metastable phases of lower Pt concentration than Al2Pt [9], which is contrary to the 
Al-Cu [16] and Al-Au [17] systems where no stable Al-rich phases exist before the θ′ and 
η phases. However, there is hitherto no consensus on the precipitation sequences in the 
Al-Pt system. For instance, it remains unclear as to which phase will form after quenching 
an Al-Pt alloy, and which one will precipitate first [18-20].  
In this work, we used first-principles calculations based on density-functional 
theory (DFT) combined with classical nucleation theory (CNT) to determine the 
thermodynamical stabilities of different phases, precipitate interfacial energies, and 
precipitation sequences in the Al-Pt binary system. We reveal the possible existence of 
two new phases, Al5Pt and Al3Pt[7-9]. Among all phases, only θ′-like Al2Pt is predicted4 
to form thermodynamically stable coherent interfaces along the {001}𝐴𝑙 planes and is 
likely to precipitate first directly from the supersaturated solid solution, thereby bypassing 
phases with higher Al content which could be expected to form first based on chemical 
potential alone. We illustrate that solute clusters, GP zones, and non-bulk like interfaces 
are unlikely to form due to the significant low solute formation energy of Pt in the Al 
matrix. Our study thus fills knowledge gaps in the Al-Pt alloy system and more generally, 
provides a workflow to determine precipitate phases and precipitation in an arbitrary 
binary alloying system.

Methods 
We first calculate the relaxed lattice parameters, thermodynamic characteristics, elastic 
properties, and interfacial energies of phases in the binary Al-Pt system using density-
functional theory (DFT). These DFT results are then adopted as input parameters for the 
classical nucleation theory (CNT) calculations to examine the precipitation sequences. 
All DFT calculations were carried out using Vienna ab initio simulation package 
(VASP) [21-24]. The plane-wave basis set was described by the projector augmented 
wave method (PAW) [25, 26]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation 
functional for the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) were used [27]. For Al, Pt, 
Cu, Au and Ag, 3s23p1, 5d96s1, 3d104s1, 5d106s1, and 4d105s1 were treated as valence 
electrons respectively. The cut-off energy of 500 eV and the grid spacing of 0.08 /Å were 
used to generate a gamma-centred Monkhorst-Pack grid for sampling the Brillouin-zone 
to achieve sufficient accuracy for all calculations. To achieve a sufficient accuracy, 
energies and forces were converged within  1 × 10−6 eV and f 0.01 eV/Å t, respectively.  
For calculations of phonons, we used a tighter energy tolerance criterion of 1 × 10−8 eV. 
We applied the CNT formalism to calculate the thermodynamics of precipitate 
nucleation: 
∆𝐺𝑡𝑜𝑡= 𝑉∆𝐺𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚+ 𝑉∆𝐺𝑒𝑙+ 𝐴𝛾,                                                                                      ( 1 ) 
where 𝑉 is the volume of the nucleus, ∆𝐺𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚 is the chemical energy, ∆𝐺𝑒𝑙 is the elastic 
strain energy, 𝛾 is the average interfacial energy, and 𝐴 is the area of the interfaces 
between the precipitated phases and matrix. Further details of CNT calculations are 
presented in the Supplementary Information 1.6

Results  
We first present the thermodynamic characteristics of various phases in Al-Pt binary 
system as calculated by DFT methods (see Sec. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3).  Based on the obtained 
thermodynamic characteristics, we propose phases that can possibly precipitate from the 
supersaturated solid solution of Pt in Al matrix. Next we investigate interfacial structure, 
interfacial energies and elastic properties of possible precipitated phases in Sec. 3.4, 3.5, 
and 3.6 respectively. Finally, we estimate the critical nucleation radii and nucleation 
barriers based on computed energies via CNT (see Sec. 3.7). 
 
3.1 
Stable and Metastable Phases 
We first investigate intermetallic phases between Al and Pt to provide a preliminary 
understanding of the binary Al-Pt system. Here we investigated the crystal structure and 
stability of the well accepted as well as controversial phases in this alloy system. Our 
results and data reported in literature are summarised in Table 1. A challenge in 
determining thermodynamic characteristics of Al-rich Al-Pt alloy system is that the full 
crystal structures of some reported phases, such as Al5Pt [18] and Al3Pt [7, 19, 20], are 
still unknown. We thus modelled these phases based on known intermetallic phases of 
the same chemical formula in binary systems with elements in the same group of Al and 
Pt. Among all possible crystal structures, those with the lowest formation energy are 
selected. Al5Pt is modelled from Ga5Pd and Al3Pt is modelled from Tl3Pt. Further details 
for these calculations are provided in Supplementary Information 2. We assess the 
stability or metastability of different Al-Pt phases by the formation energy per atom (𝐸𝑓

calculated as7

and 𝐸𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘
𝑃𝑡 are the per atom energies of bulk Al and Pt, respectively. A more negative 
formation energy represents a higher stability of the concerned phase. Since the 
precipitation in binary Al alloys occurs at temperatures in the range of 100-300 °C, we 
have also calculated the Helmholtz free energy of formation per atom (𝐹𝑓
𝑎𝑡.), similarly to  
LLorca et al.’s definition [28]

The corresponding Helmholtz free energy (𝐹) for each case is calculated as 
𝐹= 𝐸−𝑇𝑆,                                                                                                                       ( 4 ) 
where 𝐸 is the energy calculated at 0 K and 𝑆 is the vibrational entropy contribution as a 
function of temperature. Again, a more negative free energy of formation represents 
greater stability. Here we have only considered vibrational contributions to the total 
entropy, since the configurational entropy can be neglected due to the low content of Pt, 
and the electronic entropy is small compared to vibrational entropy even for transition 
metals [29].  
Figure 2 shows the calculated formation energies of intermetallic phases in the 
binary Al-Pt alloy system. These agree well with experimental measurements [9], except 
for an outlier at a concentration of 74.7 at. % Pt. The Al5Pt phase possesses a formation 
energy close to the convex hull, which is in agreement with a previous DFT calculation 
[11]. Therefore, Al5Pt is a possible stable phase. Figure 3 shows changes in the Helmholtz8 
free energy of formation per atom from 0 K to 1000 K of selected Al-rich phases in the 
Al-Pt binary system. Whereas most phases become less stable at high temperatures, Al3Pt 
shows the opposite behaviour because it is stabilised by entropy at high temperatures. 
Therefore, Al3Pt is a possible stable phase at high temperatures. The Al5Pt phase has a 
small energy increment with temperature, supporting the previous argument about its 
stability.

3.2 
The Pt Solid Solution 
Since we are interested in predicting precipitation behaviour of Al-rich precipitate phases 
from a supersaturated solid solution of Pt in Al matrix, the natural starting point is the 
determination of Pt solute formation energies and its solubility. To interpret the results, 
we also examine the nature of the electronic interactions between solute and matrix. The 
solute formation energy per solute (𝐸𝑓
𝑠.) can be calculated by

Here, a more negative value indicates a more stable state of solute X in Al matrix. We 
use a 4 × 4 × 4 supercell to avoid any interactions between solute atoms, and N is the 
number of atoms in the supercell. Because Pt shows certain similarities to Cu and Au in 
the Al matrix as mentioned, we compare the solute formation energy of Pt to that of group 
11 elements including Cu, Ag and Au (see Table 2). To our knowledge, no previous work 
exists for Pt. Our calculated results for other elements compare well with previous DFT 
calculations [31], and the minor discrepancies may be due to the smaller supercell size 
used in previous work.  
We find that Pt has the most negative formation energy among all selected solutes, 
indicating Pt solute should be stable in Al matrix. However, the solute formation energy 
is not directly correlated to the experimental solubility limit (see Table 2). This is because 
ordered phases will form beyond the solubility limit, and these phases are easier to form 
when two elements bind strongly according to the Hume-Rothery rules [32]. In addition, 
the formation energy is calculated at 0K and misses the contribution from the entropy at 
finite temperatures. Therefore, to evaluate the solubility of Pt in Al matrix, we calculate 
its solubility limit (𝑐𝑠) as [33]11 
𝑐𝑠= exp (

),                                                                                                                                         ( 6 )

𝐴𝑙𝑥𝑃𝑡𝑦 is the Helmholtz free energy of the first 
ordered phase, and 𝑘𝐵 is the Boltzmann constant. Since the solubility limit depends on 
the first ordered phase, we have chosen both Al4Pt and Al5Pt as they are the 2 possible 
first ordered phases in the phase diagram as discussed in the previous section. 
Figure 4 shows the calculated solubility limit for Pt in Al matrix, with and without 
the entropy contribution. It can be observed that the calculated solubility limit is close to 
the experimental value at the temperature slightly higher than the eutectic temperature 
when considering Al5Pt as the first stable Al-rich phase (see Figure 4) [9]. This also 
suggests that Al5Pt could be the first ordered phase in the Al-Pt system as indicated in the 
previous section. 
To quantitatively analyse the solute formation energies and the electronic 
interactions between Pt and Al, we calculate the bonding electron density as 
∆𝜌= 𝜌−𝜌𝐼𝐴𝑀,                                                                                                            ( 8 ) 
where 𝜌 is the electron density determined by a self-consistent calculation after full 
relaxation, and 𝜌𝐼𝐴𝑀 is the electron density based on the independent atom model. Figure 
5 presents the bonding electron density in the (110) plane since the bonding electrons are 
located in the tetrahedral holes in Al [34]. We also compare electron densities along 3 
directions with largest magnitude of bonding electron densities (see Figure 5 (b)). It is 
evident that Pt forms the strongest and Ag forms the weakest bond to Al among all 412 
alloying elements, in the same order as their solute formation energies:  𝐸𝑓.

Pt in Al matrix.

Pt Clusters and GP Zone like Structures in Al Matrix 
Having investigated the thermodynamics of Pt solute in Al matrix, the next step is to 
determine whether clusters or GP zones will form in the early stages of precipitation, as 
these will affect the subsequent formation of precipitate phases [2]. To this aim, we model 
various cluster configurations by considering 3 substitutional Pt/Cu atoms in a large 
4 × 4 × 4 Al supercell. In the Al-Cu system, a GP zone is a single Cu layer in Al matrix 
and θ′′ (GP-II zone) is formed by two Cu layers separated by 3 Al layers in Al matrix. 
Given the similarity between the Al2X phases in Al-Pt and Al-Cu systems, GP zone like 
structures in the Al-Pt system are modelled as one or two infinitely large and 
monoatomically thin Pt layers on the {002} planes and separated by several {002}𝐴𝑙 
layers. The supercell is sufficiently large to represent both GP zone-like structures and 
θ′′ like structures. For all configurations, we calculate the excess energy per solute atom 
relative to Pt solute as

We also include the data for Cu solute atoms for a comparison with Pt solute atoms. The 
calculated excess energies for all configurations are shown in Figure 6. We find that the 
energetically most favourable cluster configurations consist of three nearest neighbour Pt 
atoms located on (001) or (111) planes (see Figure 6 (a)). These planes are the most 
common precipitate habit planes in Al alloys [2]. Whereas three coplanar Pt atoms can 
exhibit a negative excess energy, a single Pt layer in Al matrix shows positive excess 
energies both on (001) and (111) planes (0.07 eV and 0.36 eV, respectively). The excess 
energies are positive for all configurations of GP zone like structure for Pt (see Figure 6 
(b)). Two Pt layers on (001) planes separated by 7 layers of Al is more favourable than15 
other configurations. In contrast, two Cu layers on (001) separated by 3 layers of Al is 
more favourable than other configurations (i.e., identical to θ′′ phase). When compared 
with Pt, Cu has negative excess energies in all configurations of clusters (Figure 6 (a)), 
GP zones, and θ′′ [36].  
Based on these results, we conclude that coherent precipitates such as GP zones 
and θ′′ are unlikely form in the Al-Pt binary alloy system. Large solute clusters of Pt are 
also unlikely to form since only a limited number of stable configurations exist. It should 
be noted that although entropy is not considered here, the overall conclusion about 
clusters, GP zones and θ′′ in Al-Pt systems will not change as the entropy have a positive 
contribution to the excess energy for all configurations.

Precipitate Shape and Crystallographic Relationship with Matrix 
Precipitate shape and their crystallographic orientation in the matrix have a strong 
influence on mechanical properties of the binary alloy—high-aspect-ratio precipitates on 
low-index planes such as {001} or {111} tend to be most efficient at blocking stress-
induced dislocations and thus imparting high strength to the alloy [2]. Such precipitates 
are usually coherent with the matrix in one or two dimensions [2], which means some of 
their interfaces or edges match well with the matrix. It is therefore critical to determine 
the possible crystallographic relationship(s) between precipitates and matrix, which will 
determine the precipitate shape and interfaces. To do so, we adopt Kelly et al.’s method 
[37, 38] whereby low-index crystallographic planes in Al and precipitate structures are 
compared. The search was limited to the three most densely packed planes for each crystal 
structure, as they are more likely to result in a good match and hence low-energy 
interfaces. More specifically, we looked for cases where both interplanar and interatomic 
spacings have less than 10% misfit [37], and consequently, a greater likelihood for the 
formation of a coherent interface.  Only Al2Pt, Al3Pt and Al5Pt were found to satisfy these 
matching conditions. Figure 7 shows the matched planes and corresponding interfaces 
between Al2Pt and Al matrix. The best match for Al2Pt in Al is for the following 
crystallographic relationship: (002)𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡||(002)𝐴𝑙 and (220)𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡||(200)𝐴𝑙, leading to 
a coherent interface, (002)𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡||(002)𝐴𝑙, and 2 sets of semicoherent interfaces, 
perpendicular to the coherent interface. The coherent interface is likely to be much larger 
than the semicoherent interfaces. This is analogous to the case of θ′ (Al2Cu) and η (Al2Au) 
precipitates in Al [3, 39].  
Based on the orientation relationship determined above, we constructed supercells 
representing an Al2Pt precipitate embedded in Al matrix to examine the stability of17 
different interfaces using DFT calculations. When lattice parameters 𝑎 and 𝑏 of Al2Pt 
embedded in Al matrix are fixed to 𝑎𝐴𝑙= 4.04 Å to model the coherent interface, the 
lattice parameter 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡/𝐴𝑙 is found to increase from 5.94 Å in bulk to 6.27 Å in the Al 
matrix. As shown in Table 3, the formation energy per atom and excess energy per solute 
are both negative, suggesting a supersaturated solid solution of Pt in Al can be expected 
to decompose into stable Al2Pt precipitates in the above orientation relationships. Because 
non-bulk like interfaces have been observed within the θ′ (Al2Cu) structure as a result of 
Cu solute segregation, the segregation of Pt into the interfaces of Al2Pt is considered [40]. 
Segregation of a Pt atom increases the formation energy by 0.70 eV, indicating the Al2Pt 
will displays a bulk like interface similar to η (Al2Au) rather than θ′ [40, 41]. This is 
mainly due to the significantly lower solute formation energy of Pt in Al compared to that 
of Cu. The entropy is not considered when examining interfaces as the embedded 
precipitate in our model is small compared to the Al matrix.

The matching of Al3Pt and Al5Pt crystal structures with the Al matrix was 
analysed with the same method. We found that Al3Pt and Al5Pt precipitates are unlikely 
to form coherent interfaces because of the positive excess energies (see Supplementary 
Information 3). In summary, Al2Pt precipitates are likely to have a plate shape because of 
its 2-dimensional matching to the Al matrix. This is structurally analogous to η (as 
already mentioned) and to the θ′ phase [3]. Al3Pt and Al5Pt are likely to have equiaxed 
shapes since no low-energy interface is found, which is also the case for Al4Pt and Al21Pt8 
[42].

Interfacial Energies for Al2Pt Precipitate in Al Matrix 
Interfacial energy is a key parameter controlling the shape and thermodynamics of 
precipitation. To calculate the interfacial energy, we first calculate the formation energies 
of Al2Pt precipitate supercells with different size (see Figure 8). Then, the interfacial 
energies between a Al2Pt precipitate and the Al matrix can be obtained from the slope of 
the change in formation energy as a function of  supercell size [43, 44]. We use the bulk-
like interfaces for θ′ (Al2Cu) analogous to that of Al2Pt for an equivalent comparison. It 
can be seen that Al2Pt has a significantly smaller interfacial energy of 129 mJ/m2 of the 
coherent interfaces, but a similar interfacial energy of the semicoherent interfaces when 
compared to θ′ precipitate in Al matrix. Therefore, Al2Pt precipitates may have a higher 
equilibrium aspect ratio than θ′ precipitate in Al matrix.

is only a half of that of θ′.20 
3.6 
Elastic Properties 
The strain energy associated with the misfit of all precipitate phases with Al matrix is the 
last parameter required as input into our CNT calculations. The elastic properties for all 
Al-Pt binary phases considered here are calculated based on DFT [45].  Strains within the 
range of ±1.5% with an increment of 0.5% were applied in all effective directions 
according to the crystal symmetry of the binary phase. Our results, presented in Table 4, 
are in good agreement with published values [46], but display appreciable differences 
with calculations reported in [11], especially for the shear modulus and Young’s modulus 
of Al4Pt and Al2Pt. The validity of our results is supported by the fact that elastic 
properties calculated for pure Al are closer to the experimental measurements in our work 
than in [9].

3.7 
Thermodynamics of Precipitate Nucleation 
Having calculated the interfacial energies and strain energies, we can now predict the 
energy change during nucleation, which measures the likelihood of precipitation of 
various phases in the Al-Pt binary system. We have assumed a plate-like shape for the 
Al2Pt precipitate and a spherical shape for the remaining binary phases with incoherent 
interfaces. By assuming homogeneous nucleation directly from a supersaturated solid 
solution, and 𝛾= 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑖
𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡 for all incoherent spherical phases, we calculate the 
thermodynamics of precipitate nucleation based on the CNT formalism.  
Figure 9 shows the change in Gibb’s free energy for nucleation of phases in Al-
Pt binary system. Among all phases considered here, Al2Pt has the lowest nucleation 
energy barrier and critical radius, indicating it will be the first phase to precipitate, in 
agreement with the experimental observation [19]. Among the three smallest thicknesses 
of Al2Pt nuclei that we considered,  1 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 is the most favoured thickness according 
to our calculations. This is because the large, favourable chemical potential for Al2Pt to 
nucleate outweighs the unfavourable contribution of misfit strain energy due to a greater 
thickness (see Supplementary Information 4). Also worth noting is the much smaller 
critical radius and barrier to nucleation for Al2Pt compared to θ′  (Al2Cu) (see 
Supplementary Information 4). Again, this is mainly due to the significantly larger 
chemical potential for Al2Pt to nucleate compare with that of  θ′. As displayed in Table 
5, the nucleation temperature has a negligible effect on the ranking of the nucleation 
related parameters. Based on these calculations, the phases can be ranked in terms of ease 
of nucleation as: Al2Pt > Al21Pt8 > Al4Pt > Al5Pt > Al3Pt, with Al2Pt being the easiest 
phase to nucleate from the solid solution.22

Discussion 
4.1 
Phases in the binary Al-Pt System 
Intermetallic phases with higher Al content than the precipitate phase (i.e., Al2Pt) are also 
of interest here because they may form in Al-rich Al-Pt alloys. As reflected by studies 
published to date [7-9, 12, 13, 18, 19, 48], it hitherto remains unclear which Al-Pt phases 
are stable or metastable. The full crystal structure of these phases is also not known. For 
example, the stable phase with the highest Al concentration is believed to be Al21Pt5  [9, 
12, 13], even though its full crystal structure is yet to be determined. In disagreement 
with this report, a recent experimental work claimed that the equilibrium phase with the 
highest Al content might be Al4Pt [7, 8]. Our work supports this view—Al4Pt is found to 
have a more negative formation energy per atom (-0.54 eV) compared to Al21Pt5 (-0.36 
eV), and sits close to the convex hull (see Figure 2). Therefore, our work strongly suggest 
Al4Pt is the most likely equilibrium phase with highest Al content.  
When exploring the Al-rich part of the Al-Pt phase diagram, we considered the 
possible phase Al5Pt (see Section 3.1), as it may compete with Al4Pt for precipitation. A 
metastable phase 𝜖 with a composition of Al5Pt was reported to precipitate first in rapidly 
quenched Al-Pt alloys. This phase (𝜖) was determined to have an atomic volume of 17.05 
Å3 [18]. As shown in Section 3.1, we proposed a crystal structure for Al5Pt (I4/mcm) 
and calculated its formation energy, which was found to be negative and to be slightly 
above the convex hull similar to previous calculation [11]. Our proposed crystal structure 
results in an atomic volume of 17.09 Å3, which is very close to the experimental value 
[18]. Therefore, Al5Pt can be considered a plausible candidate for precipitation.24 
A metastable phase of composition Al3Pt has also been suggested as a possible 
precipitate phase at room temperature [19, 20]. More recently, a high-temperature stable 
phase denoted 𝜉 and of the same composition Al3Pt was reported to be stable [7]. Based 
on DFT calculations for several possible archetypal structures, we proposed a crystal 
structure for Al3Pt with space group Pm3̅n (see Section 3.1). For Al3Pt in our work, we 
used the most stable structure (i.e. Pm3̅n) because the full crystal structure of 𝜉 is still 
unknown [7]. However, the calculated XRD powder pattern for Al3Pt (Pm3̅n) (see 
Supplementary Information 1) does not match the XRD pattern of 𝜉, indicating that the 
phase characterised in Ref. [7] does not have our proposed structure. Metastable Al6Pt 
was also reported in quenched Al-Pt samples [19]. The only crystallographic information 
available is that Al6Pt is isostructural with the Ga6Pt structure with lattice parameters 
𝑎𝐴𝑙6𝑃𝑡= 15.762 Å,𝑏𝐴𝑙6𝑃𝑡= 12.103 Å  and 𝑐𝐴𝑙6𝑃𝑡= 8.318 Å  [19], but their detailed 
atomic positions remain unknown [48]. In summary, our work confirms the equilibrium 
phase is Al4Pt rather than Al21Pt5. We also suggest possible crystal structures for Al5Pt 
and Al3Pt. 
 
4.2 
Precipitation Sequence in Al-Pt 
Several studies have examined precipitation in Al-Pt alloys [7, 8, 18-20]; however, all but 
one [19] deal with precipitation from the melt rather than solid solution. In this section, 
we focus on solid-state precipitation, which is important for high-strength properties. First, 
no GP zones have been reported to form in Al-Pt alloys, and our DFT results presented 
in Section 3.3 also suggests that large clusters and GP zones of Pt are thermodynamically 
unstable in Al.25 
We predict the Al2Pt precipitate phase to adopt an orientation relationship similar 
to that of θ′ and η phase in Al-Cu and Al-Au binary systems respectively. This is different 
from what was proposed in [19] based on electron diffraction methods. We found that the 
orientation relationship in [19] provides poor matching between DFT relaxed Al2Pt and 
Al matrix, in contrast to our proposed orientation relationship. As shown in Section 3.7, 
Al2Pt appears to be the strongest candidate to precipitate first from the solute solution. 
This agrees with early studies of solid-state precipitation in Al-Pt alloys by 
Chattopadhyay et al. [19, 49]. This may seem surprising at first, because Al2Pt is in 
competition with as many as four phases with much greater Al content, namely: Al6Pt, 
Al5Pt, Al4Pt and Al3Pt. These phases have been observed after rapidly quenching Al-(2-
3)at.% Pt alloys from the melt [18-20]. Indeed, the Al6Pt phase was reported to precipitate 
from the solute solution, but after Al2Pt [19]. Given the full crystal structure of Al6Pt is 
still not known, it is difficult to accurately calculate the thermodynamic parameters for 
its nucleation such as nucleation energy barrier and critical radius.  Nevertheless, using 
crude approximations, we find that Al6Pt is likely not to precipitate prior to Al2Pt (see 
Supplementary Information 5). This is in agreement with Ref. [19]. 
Regarding the Al5Pt and Al3Pt phases, they contain lattice planes that match Al 
matrix planes well. However, the interfaces that were considered based on matching these 
planes were found to be unstable by DFT. Although no thermodynamically stable 
interfaces were found in this work, a more systematic search may reveal low energy 
interfaces. In this case, Al5Pt and Al3Pt may form prior to Al2Pt (see details in 
Supplementary Information 6). However, this situation would contradict the experimental 
evidence available to date [18, 20].26 
4.3 
Effect of Bonding Electron Density on Solute Formation Energy 
Our DFT calculation indicated that Pt has a significant negative solute formation energy 
in Al. The large bonding electron density between Al and Pt as shown in Figure 5 may 
explain the unfavourable segregation of Pt into the interfaces of Al2Pt precipitates 
compared to that of Cu, and the low coherent interfacial energy of Al2Pt compared to θ′ 
(Al2Cu). Compared to Pt and Cu, the bonding between Al and Ag is weaker than that 
between Al atoms, which is consistent with the positive solute formation energy of Ag in 
the Al matrix. The distribution of bonding electron density is different for different solute 
atoms (Cu, Au, Pt, Ag) — in the case of Pt and Au, bonding is stronger in the <110> 
directions compared with Cu and Ag. This can be correlated with the solute formation 
energy which is most negative for Pt and Au. 
 
4.4 
Workflow to predict solid-state precipitation in an arbitrary binary alloy 
system 
Finally, to predict solid-state precipitation in an arbitrary binary alloy system M-X, where 
M is the matrix element and X is the solute, we propose the following systematic 
workflow. The first step is to identify all stable and metastable intermetallic phases known 
between two chemical elements based on the equilibrium phase diagram and databases 
of crystal structures [6]. A precipitate phase is likely to be structurally related to known 
bulk intermetallic phases, but not always, as is the case for θ′ (Al2Cu). The full crystal 
structure of each phase must be known in order to carry out thermodynamics calculations 
using DFT methods. Because some phases are only stable in a certain temperature range, 
we need to consider the temperature effect on their stability by estimating the entropy27 
contribution. A major challenge here is that some intermetallic phases are either unknown 
or have not had their crystal structure solved. In this case, one approach is to adopt crystal 
structures of phases in similar systems, such as systems between elements in the same 
group on the periodic table. 
The second step is to determine the solute behaviour of X in M. This allows us to 
determine properties such as solubility, segregation energy and chemical potential. These 
properties are required in the subsequent steps. 
The third step is investigating the interaction of solute atoms, including the 
possible formation of clusters and GP zone-like structures. The main challenge here is to 
consider all possible configurations of solute aggregates. Currently, accurate DFT 
calculations are limited to hundreds of atoms, and therefore only up to a handful of solute 
atoms. Nevertheless, these methods allow one to explore whether fully coherent 
precipitates might exist. 
The fourth step is predicting the shape and interfacial structure of precipitate 
phases, which is a great challenge. This requires the orientation relationship(s) between a 
given precipitate phase and matrix to be determined. One approach is to match the crystal 
structure of the precipitate phase with the matrix [37, 38]. Based on the matched planes, 
we can then propose possible low energy interfaces, calculate their interfacial energies 
and misfit strain energies, and suggest the possible shape of each precipitate phase.  
Finally, the last step is to predict the nucleation barrier and critical size of each 
precipitate phase, thus allowing the precipitation sequence to be proposed. One approach, 
as used here, involves CNT calculations using DFT calculated quantities. Our CNT 
calculations are rather crude with many assumptions especially for the interfacial energies28 
of incoherent precipitates. However, it allows a qualitatively convincing investigation of 
precipitation in the unexplored Al-Pt alloy system.

Conclusion 
In this work, we propose a workflow to predict the solid-state precipitation behaviour in 
the binary Al-Pt system, based on a combination of atomistic first principles methods 
using density-functional theory and classical nucleation theory calculations. The bulk 
intermetallic phases Al4Pt, Al21Pt8, Al2Pt, Al3Pt2, AlPt (α & β), Al3Pt5, AlPt2 (α & β) and 
AlPt3 (α & β) are confirmed to be thermodynamically stable. Our calculations also support 
the possible existence of Al5Pt and Al3Pt. A significantly low formation energy of Pt in 
Al is found. This results in a high energy barrier for Pt to form clusters, GP zones, and 
non-bulk interfaces. When considering precipitate phases, our calculations strongly 
suggest that Al2Pt will adopt a similar orientation relationship and shape to the θ′ (Al2Cu) 
phase, and will precipitate first. Similarly to θ′, Al2Pt precipitates are expected to exhibit 
plate-like shapes with high aspect ratios. Our results are in partial agreement with 
previous inconclusive experimental work [19, 49], and motivate further experimental 
validation through a detailed microscopic characterisation of solid-state precipitation in 
Al-Pt alloys. Our work constitutes an initial step towards predicting solid-state 
precipitation in an arbitrary Al alloy system, and ultimately, towards the discovery of 
high-performance Al alloys.29

S1. Details of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) Calculations 
To predict the precipitation sequences, the energy change during nucleation of different 
precipitate phases is calculated according to the classical nucleation theory (CNT) as 
∆𝐺𝑡𝑜𝑡= 𝑉∆𝐺𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚+ 𝑉∆𝐺𝑒𝑙+ 𝐴𝛾,                                                                                                          ( S1 ) 
where 𝑉 is the volume of the nucleus, ∆𝐺𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚 is the chemical energy, ∆𝐺𝑒𝑙 is the elastic 
strain energy, 𝛾 is the interfacial energy, and 𝐴 is the area of the interfaces between the 
precipitate phase and matrix. ∆𝐺𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚 for a precipitate phase can be estimated by its 
excess Helmholtz free energy per atom, ∆𝐹𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠

 is the entropy contribution per atom at a certain temperature. Calculations 
at 300K and 500K are carried out to represent precipitation at the room temperature and 
the aging temperature. Because all precipitates are embedded in the Al matrix, 𝑉𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚 is 
calculated by the atomic volume of Al as 
𝑉𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚= (𝑎𝐴𝑙)3 4

For plate-like Al2Pt, the elastic energy can be calculated based on the Christian’s 
approximation [1, 2]:

where 𝜇 is the shear modulus, 𝜈 is the Poisson’s ratio, and 𝜀 is the tensile strain normal 
to habit planes. Since Al and Al2Pt have very similar shear modulus, 𝜇 is assumed to be34
the same for matrix and precipitates (25 GPa). The strain along the coherent direction can 
also be ignored as it has little effect compared to the strain along the semicoherent 
direction. The tensile strain can then be evaluated as  [2] 
𝜀= 2

𝑛𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑡.+𝑚𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥.                                                                                                                             ( S6 ) 
For spherical phases that are incoherent with the matrix, there is no constraint to 
match the lattices and lattice sites between the precipitates and matrix. Therefore, 
Nabarro’s approximation can be used to calculate the elastic strain energy of a spherical 
inclusion of the unstrained radius volume as [3]

where 𝐸 is Young’s modulus of the matrix, 𝐾 is the bulk modulus of the precipitates, and 
𝜀 is the strain. Assuming at least one unit cell of the precipitate phase needs to nucleate 
to represent such phase, a minimum 𝜀 can be calculated as 
𝜀= 1 −Min(|

where 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)𝑝𝑝𝑡. is the maximum of lattice parameters of the precipitates, and 𝑚 
is an integer from 1. The required number of Pt atoms are also calculated in terms of the 
critical size of the nucleus

where 𝑉𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 is the critical volume of the precipitates calculated based on the critical radius,

S2. Crystallographic Information and Thermodynamics of Metastable Phases 
Here we investigate phases Al5Pt, Al21Pt5 and Al3Pt, whose crystal structures are not fully 
known. For these phases, crystal structures are proposed based on intermetallic phases 
between elements in the same group of Al and Pt.  
Table S1 lists the calculated formation energies of different phases. The crystal 
structures of these phases are adopted from intermetallic phases between elements in the 
same group of Al and Pt based on the Materials Project database [4]. Amongst two 
possibilities, the I4/mcm structure is found to be the most stable one for Al5Pt and is 
selected for further calculations. For Al3Pt phase, the Pm3̅n structure is found to have the 
lowest energy. Because Al3Pt (Pm3̅n) is stabilised by entropy at high temperatures, 
entropy contributions are considered for all possible crystal structures of Al3Pt, see Figure 
S1. It can be observed that the Pm3̅n structure remains to be the most stable one. A high-
temperature stable phase denoted 𝜉 and of a composition close to Al3Pt was reported to 
be stable above 801 ℃ [5]. Our newly proposed Al3Pt (Pm3̅n) phase is also stable at high 
temperatures. Therefore, we calculate the XRD powder patterns of all possible structures 
of Al3Pt. As shown in Figure S2, compared to the experimental measurements [5], Al3Pt 
(Pnma) shows a similar noisy pattern to the 𝜉 phase. However, small peaks between 30° 
and 40° suggests Al3Pt (Pnma) have a different crystal structure to 𝜉. Al3Pt (Pm3̅n) also 
shows distinct peaks compared to 𝜉. Therefore, 𝜉 phase may differ from any possible 
structure of Al3Pt considered in this work, or it could possibly contain more than one 
phase. Because the Pm3̅n structure is the most stable one for Al3Pt, and the full crystal 
structure of 𝜉 has not been solved [5], Al3Pt (Pm3̅n) is used for further calculations in 
this work.36

S3. Interface Matching of Al3Pt and Al5Pt 
We adopted Kelly et al.’s method [6, 7] to determine the interfacial structures between a 
give precipitate phase, Al3Pt and Al5Pt, and Al matrix. Both Al3Pt (Pm3̅n)  and  Al5Pt 
(I4/mcm) possess certain planes that can match Al matrix (see Figure S3, S4). For Al3Pt, 
its (200) planes can match the (111) planes of Al. For Al5Pt, its pure Al layers on (002) 
planes can match the (001) planes of Al. The best matches for these two precipitate phases 
results in the following crystallographic relationships: (200)𝐴𝑙3𝑃𝑡||(111)𝐴𝑙 and 
(002)𝐴𝑙5𝑃𝑡||(001)𝐴𝑙,
 leading 
to 
interfaces,
(200)𝐴𝑙3𝑃𝑡||(111)𝐴𝑙
 and 
(002)𝐴𝑙5𝑃𝑡||(001)𝐴𝑙. We then constructed supercells representing Al3Pt and Al5Pt 
precipitate phases embedded in Al based on the above orientation relationship in order to 
examine the stability of their interfaces using DFT calculations. The interfaces between 
Al3Pt/Al5Pt and the Al matrix are not thermodynamically stable due to their positive 
excess energy 𝐸𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠
𝑠.
 (see Table S2, S3). Therefore, a spherical shape is assumed for 
Al3Pt and Al5Pt because there is no stable coherent interface found for these phases.

S4. Comparing the nucleation behaviour of Al2Pt to 𝛉′ (Al2Cu) 
Because Al2Pt shows certain similarities to θ′ (Al2Cu), we compared their nucleation 
behaviour. In Figure S5, dark blue curves and light blue curves are references that show 
the energy change during nucleation of θ′ and Al2Pt respectively. The phase Al2Pt has 
much smaller nucleation energy barrier and critical radius compared to θ′. The medium 
blue curves indicate the contribution of a certain parameter. The large difference in 
chemical potential  is the major effects on nucleation, and the interfacial energy also have 
noticeable effect. In contrast, the influence of the misfit strain is neglectable. 
The thickness of Al2Pt affects precipitation as it leads to different strains: 𝜀=
 −0.25,+0.15,+0.03 for 𝑡= 1 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑,1.5 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑, 2 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑, respectively. A 
thickness of 2 𝑐θ′−𝐴𝑙2𝐶𝑢
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 is most desired for θ′ . However, 1 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 is more 
favourable than 1.5 or 2 𝑐𝐴𝑙2𝑃𝑡
𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 for Al2Pt for its lowest nucleation energy barrier and 
critical number of Pt atoms. This is also because of the large chemical potential for Al2Pt 
to nucleate outweighs the influence of elastic strain energy.41

and critical radius at 500 K. Dark and light blue represent the references of θ′ (Al2Cu) 
and Al2Pt. In (a), (b), and (c), a single parameter (chemical potential, interfacial energy, 
strain) of θ′ is changed to the according value of Al2Pt.42
S5. Comparing the nucleation behaviour of Al2Pt to Al6Pt 
The Al6Pt phase was reported to precipitate from the solid solution after Al2Pt [8]. 
Because the full crystal structure of Al6Pt is still unknown, we use crude approximations 
to estimate its nucleation behaviour. Assuming Al6Pt has the same formation energy per 
solute atom compared to Al2Pt (i.e., Al6Pt sits on the convex hull), an interfacial energy 
of 296 mJ/m2 is required to allow Al6Pt has a same nucleation energy barrier to Al2Pt (see 
Figure S6). This is a small interfacial energy considering the semicoherent interfacial 
energies of Al2Pt and θ′ (Al2Cu) are around 500 mJ/m2. Because no stable phase has been 
reported with a stoichiometric of Al6Pt, and an interface with low interfacial energy is 
undermined, Al6Pt is unlikely to precipitate prior to Al2Pt. 
 
Figure S6. Comparing energy change between Al6Pt and Al2Pt during nucleation. The 
blue curves are spherical Al6Pt with different interfacial energies.43
S6. Comparing the nucleation behaviour of Al2Pt to Al5Pt and Al3Pt 
For phases Al5Pt and Al3Pt that contain lattice planes that match Al matrix planes well, 
possible, yet unrevealed, low energy interfaces may facilitate their precipitation. 
Following the similar process as in Sec. S5, interfacial energies of 302 mJ/m3 and 196 
mJ/m3 are required for Al5Pt and Al3Pt respectively to obtain a same nucleation energy 
barrier compared to Al2Pt (see Figure S7). These interfacial energies are reasonable when 
considering their good interface matching. A noticeable obstacle is the larger critical 
radius of Al5Pt and Al3Pt than that of Al2Pt, which may impede their precipitation from 
the Pt solid solution.
