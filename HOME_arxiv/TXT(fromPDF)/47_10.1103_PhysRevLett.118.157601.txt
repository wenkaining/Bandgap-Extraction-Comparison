Abstract.  
We present the evidence of lattice rotation vortices having an average radius of ~7 nm at the 
monoclinic ferroelectric domain boundary of (1-x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PZN-xPT, x=0.08). 
Maps of crystal orientations, domain configurations, symmetry breaking are obtained using 
scanning convergent beam electron diffraction (SCBED). Such measurements suggest the merging 
of 2D and 1D topological defects, with implications for domain-switching mechanisms in relaxor 
ferroelectric crystals, and the possibility of a new form of nanoscale ferroelectric devices.

Ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) are topological defects that involve changes in the 
polarization direction accompanied by small lattice distortions. Having a large density of mobile 
DWs facilitates domain switching and therefore dramatically enhances the susceptibility of 
ferroelectrics and piezoelectric coupling coefficients [1]. DWs also exhibit emergent physical 
properties.  For example, charged DWs of BiFeO3 [2] and Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 [3] exhibit a significant 
conductivity increase compared to bulk materials, which can be advantageous for device 
applications [4]. The structural determination of DWs requires 1) identifying two neighboring 
polarization domains, 2) determining the transition structure between the domains, and 3) 
identifying the nature of the polarization in the transition region.    
The ferroelectric domains can be identified by optical microscopy [5], scanning probe 
microscopy [6], x-ray diffraction [7-10], neutron diffraction [11-15], or electron diffraction 
techniques [16-18]. Ferroelectric DWs can be categorized by the dipole transition behaviors across 
the boundary, which are non-chiral DWs (Ising-like), chiral DWs (Bloch- or Neel-like), or mixtures 
of both [19]. The structural determination of DWs was demonstrated by Nelson et al. and Jia et al. 
using atomic resolution electron imaging for tetragonal Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 [20, 21] and rhombohedral 
BiFeO3 [22] crystals by quantifying the displacements of atomic columns. However, such 
techniques have yet to be applied to relaxor ferroelectric crystals with monoclinic symmetry.

PMN-PT), exceptional piezoelectric properties [23] are obtained at the morphotropic phase 
boundary (MPB), where nanometer-sized monoclinic domains have been reported by X-ray 
diffraction [5, 24], neutron diffraction [11-15], and electron microscopy [16, 18, 25]. However, we 
know very little about the structure of DWs in relaxor ferroelectric crystals and the properties of 
DWs, because of the experimental challenge of determining monoclinic, and nanometer-sized,3 
 
domains. Moreover, Houchmandzadeh and coworkers showed that the coupling between two order 
parameters, such as electric dipoles and strain, can induce chirality at the DWs [26].  
Here, we describe a scanning convergent beam electron diffraction (SCBED) study of the 
DWs in the relaxor-based ferroelectric crystal of PZN-8%PT. Using energy-filtered (EF) SCBED. 
We have identified nm-sized domains having monoclinic (M) Pm symmetry in single crystal PZN-
8%PT. A careful examination of the DWs revealed the presence of lattice rotation vortices near 
DWs. These vortices involve continuous lattice rotation across length scales of ~15nm in diameter.  
 
Single crystal PZN-8%PT (unpoled flux-grown single crystal, Microfine Materials 
Technologies Pte. Ltd., Singapore) was selected for study. Thin crystals were prepared along 
pseudocubic axes of ሾ100ሿ௉஼, ሾ001ሿ௉஼and ሾ111ሿ௉஼ using the method described previously [27]. 
The same sample preparation procedure was applied successfully for the determination of 
symmetry in single crystal BaTiO3 [28].  
The principle of domain identification is based on CBED determination of crystal 
symmetry, which has the spatial resolution ranging from few to hundreds of nanometer [29-31]. By 
scanning over a region of the crystal, ferroelectric domains can be identified by the change of 
CBED pattern symmetry (Fig. 1). For example, the mirror direction can be used to determine the 
60° domains in PMN-31%PT with the aid of dynamic diffraction simulation using the Bloch wave 
method [25, 32]. To quantify the symmetries of the CBED patterns, normalized cross-correlation 
(γm) values of a pair of diffraction discs related by mirror symmetry are computed using the 
algorithm previously proposed by Kim et al. [33]. For convenience of having just one γm value for 
one CBED pattern, the γm values of three pairs of discs with the highest intensity were averaged, 
noted as γm,average shown in Fig. 1(a). Spatial distribution of different CBED patterns are indicated 
by different colors in Fig. 1(d), which are used to represent the measured γm,average [25]. The BF disk 
(transmitted beam) of CBED possesses the center of symmetry belonging to the Laue diffraction4 
 
group according to Buxton et al. [29]. The location of the center of symmetry changes when crystal 
rotates as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and (c). 
 
Figure 1. Principles of using CBED for determining mirror symmetry and crystal rotation. 
Figure (a) shows an example for the mirror symmetry quantification, while crystal rotation along 
the x- and y-axes leads to a shift in the center of the CBED (000) pattern as shown in (b) and (c). 
The average of the cross-correlation coefficients of three pairs of discs in (a) is taken as γm,average,  
whose values are shown in (d) for a scan of 15x15 points or 225 CBED patterns. Here each color 
represents a different CBED pattern, whereas similar CBED patterns are shown in the same color. 
The SCBED experiments were carried out using a JEOL 2010F FEG TEM operated at 200kV 
with a convergent beam of 2.6nm in FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Energy-filtering, which 
improves the contrast of CBED patterns, was performed using a Gatan imaging filter (GIF). EF-
SCBED was performed by scanning the focused electron probe over a selected area on a 15 x 15 
grid, step size of 2nm, and through a post-column GIF energy window of 10eV. The shift and tilt 
of diffraction patterns during beam scanning were minimized and calibrated using a silicon single5 
 
crystal [34]. Following the procedures described in [32], the symmetry of PZN-8%PT was 
determined as monoclinic Pm, which agrees with the X-ray diffraction result [12].  
 
Figure 2. Distribution of two nanodomains using SCBED. (a), (b) and (c) map out the γm,average 
variations across two types of domains. The red dashed line indicates the domain boundary. 
Nanodomains are observed using EF-SCBED. Symmetry variations across these domains in three 
EF-SCBED datasets from three different sample areas are shown in Figs. 2(a), (b), and (c). The 
scan consists of 15 by 15 points, with a step size of 2 nm. The γm,average of the representative CBED 
patterns in each region are shown in greyscale. We identified type-1 and type-2 nanodomains with 
different mirror symmetry. The boundaries between these two domains are indicated as dashed 
lines in the figures.6 
 
 
Figure 3. Maps of distribution of two nanodomains and lattice rotation vortices. Figs. (a), (b), 
and (c) show the crystal rotation at each pixel, superimposed with the domain walls indicated by 
the blue dashed lines. Figs. (d), (e), and (f) illustrates how the crystal rotates across the domain 
boundaries schematically. 
We noticed that the center-of-mass of the intensity distribution within the BF disc of each 
pattern in the EF-SCBED dataset is not always located at the exact center. This observation could 
have two possible explanations: microscope optics and local crystal tilting. First, the hysteresis in 
the scanning coils or the lens in the microscope could lead to imperfect optical alignment while 
scanning the beam, which results in an effective beam-tilt and a consequent intensity redistribution 
in the BF disc. We excluded this effect by performing EF-SCBED on a Si single crystal. This 
measurement defines the maximum electron beam tilt and the lattice rotation measurement 
precision at േ0.012 degrees. Second, if the crystal is not oriented on the exact zone axis, this small 
angular deviation could also lead to an intensity redistribution in the BF disc. This is shown7 
 
schematically in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). In an effort to quantify how much the crystal is deviated from 
the exact zone axis, we calculated the displacements (in pixels) of the center-of-mass of each BF 
disc and converted these displacements into crystal rotations (in degrees).  
By measuring the shift in the BF disc of a CBED pattern using this method, we determined 
the nanoscale rotation of the crystal and represented this rotation as a vector. The vector at each 
data point indicates the crystal rotation averaged over a volume of ~280nm3. Figs. 3(a), (b), and (c) 
show the crystal rotation map derived from the same EF-SCBED datasets as Figs. 2(a), (b), and (c), 
respectively. Figure 3(a) shows a vortex-like pattern with the vortex center near the domain 
boundary, and a radius of curvature of ~7nm calculated from the discrete points. On the other hand, 
the vortex feature is not as distinct in Figs. 3(b) and (c). The continuous crystal rotation is shown 
schematically in Figs. 3(d), (e), and (f). 
The type-1 and type-2 domains identified in Fig. 2 are associated with two distinguishable 
CBED patterns that were observed along the ሾ100ሿ௉஼ incident direction (Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)). Figs. 
2(a), (b), and (c) show the symmetry maps where these two patterns were detected. The highest γm 
values of type-1 and type-2 patterns are detected along two different directions (A and B) as shown 
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The A and B directions are rotated by 45° along the ሾ100ሿ௉஼ zone axis. The 
corresponding simulated patterns for type-1 and type-2 domains are along monoclinic Pm zone axis 
ሾ100ሿ௉௠ and ሾ010ሿ௉௠, as shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), respectively. In the Pm structure model, 
the polarization direction is ܲሬറௌൌሾݑ, 0, ݒሿ௉௠ൌሾ3,0,4ሿ௉௠, which lies in the mirror plane of Pm 
symmetry [12]. Along the ሾ100ሿ௉௠ incident direction, the ሺ001ሻ/ሺ001തሻ reflections are related by 
the mirror, which is parallel to the A direction in Fig. 4(a). This mirror is not observed along the 
ሾ010ሿ௉௠ incident direction. The projection of the polarization lies approximately on the 
ሺ101ሻ/ሺ1ത01തሻ reflections, which is parallel to the B direction in Fig. 4(b). The highest mirror 
symmetry in this case is detected along direction B in the simulated pattern (Fig. 4(d)) with

34%, respectively (The superscript indicates the domain type, and the subscript denotes the mirror 
plane direction). This shows that the mirror plane of type-1 domains is along the A direction. For 
the type-2 domains, a good match is obtained with ሾ010ሿ௉௠. The γm value along the B direction of 
the recorded patterns roughly agrees with the simulated value, with ߛ௠,௘௫௣௘௥௜௠௘௡௧௔௟ൌ54% .

of MC (Pm) using the Bloch wave method and corresponding to the experimental (a) & (b) patterns, 
respectively. The indexing is based on simulated diffraction patterns. 
Based on the best matching structural model of Pm, the orientation relationship between 
the type-1 and 2 nanodomains with respect to the pseudocubic axes is shown schematically in9 
 
Figure 5. For type-1 domains, which belong to the ሾ100ሿ௉௠ zone axis, the monoclinic axes of ܽ௉௠ 
and ܾ௉௠ are along ሾ100ሿ௉஼ and ሾ010ሿ௉஼, respectively. The ܿ௉௠ is slightly deviated away from the 
ሾ001ሿ௉஼ direction with an angle ሺ90° െߚሻ in the ܽ௉௠െܿ௉௠ plane. Type-2 domains belong to the 
ሾ010ሿ௉௠ zone axis, for which the monoclinic axes of ܽ௉௠ and ܾ௉௠ are rotated by 90° with respect 
to the cubic c-axis. If converting the two polarization directions ሾ3,0,4ሿ௉௠ and ሾ0,3,4ሿ௉௠ from 
fractional coordinates into Cartesian coordinates, the polarization directions in Cartesian 
coordinates would be [3.03, 0.02, 4.05] and [0.02, 3.01, 4.05], respectively. The angle between the 
two vectors is 50°. The presence of 50° polarization domains is also evidence which excludes the 
T- or R-symmetries, since this type of domain is only permitted in crystals with orthorhombic or 
lower symmetries [35, 36].

Flux-closure domain patterns associated with continuous dipole rotations have been 
reported in ferroelectric thin films [21, 22, 37-39] or ferroelectric nanodots [40-42] involving 
crystal systems with R or T symmetry. These patterns involve continuous dipole rotations near the 
vertices of triangular domain boundaries. The lattice rotation vortices or half-vortices observed near10 
 
the boundary of two adjacent monoclinic domains involves small rotation of the crystal lattice 
having an average value of ~0.035 degrees.   
The rotation we observed is part of the lattice deformation matrix with displacement vector

డ௫ೕ. For relaxor ferroelectric crystals with monoclinic 
symmetry, disinclination exists between two domains with an angular mismatch determined by unit 
cell parameters [36, 43].  Strain accompanies the polarization rotation due to the strong 
electromechanical coupling [9, 10, 23]. We speculate that the crystal rotation vortex can be a result 
of accommodating disinclination strain and charge discontinuity. First, the disinclination strain can 
be estimated by calculating Lagrangian finite strain tensors [44]. Lattice parameters of two 
neighboring monoclinic Pm unit cells, distorted along two directions as depicted in Figure 5, are 
input parameters for calculating the strain tensors. The maximum strain at the domain wall is 1.3%, 
which is comparable to the 1.5% strain at the vertex core of rhombohedral BiFeO3 [37]. Second, 
the charge discontinuity can be simplified by considering the surface charge density of a type-1 
domain, a type-2 domain, and at the DW, denoted ߪଵ, ߪଶ, and ߪ஽ௐ, respectively. The imbalance of 
ߪଵ, ߪଶ, and ߪ஽ௐ causes the dipoles to align with the electric field; however, the aligned dipoles 
change the surface charge and hence the electric field which causes further dipole alignment. The 
lattice rotation vortex can be the equilibrium state of the feedback process.  
In conclusion, we observed local crystal rotation vortex at the 50° monoclinic domain 
boundary. The crystal rotation vortex is attributed to disinclination strain and depolarization field 
due to charge discontinuity across the domain walls. The above observation raises important 
questions about the roles of the lattice rotation vortex in domain switching in ferroelectric systems. 
Previously, first-principles calculations have predicted an intermediate state having a coexisting 
toroidal moment and out-of-plane-polarization in ferroelectric nanoparticles [45, 46]. The11 
 
occurrence of lattice rotation vortices at the ferroelectric domain walls suggest the merging of 2D 
and 1D topological defects. An analogy can be made with the presence of magnetic vortices, known 
as skyrmions. The interplay between spin, orbital, charge, and strain degrees of freedom associated 
with skyrmions suggests a complex landscape of topological defects in ferroelectrics that may be 
explored for new applications and functionalities.
