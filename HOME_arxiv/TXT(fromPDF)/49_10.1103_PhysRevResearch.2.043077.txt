We present a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid state, quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL),
in a hydrogen-bonded electron system, by combining a quantum proton ice and Anderson’s
resonating valence bond spin liquid theory, motivated by the recent experimental discovery
of a quantum spin liquid with proton ﬂuctuations in κ-H3(Cat-EDT-TTF)2 (a.k.a.
H-Cat).
In our theory, an electron spin liquid and a proton dipole liquid are realized simultaneously
in the ground state called quantum valence bond ice.
In this state, neither of them can be
established independently of the other.
Analytical and numerical calculations reveal that this
state has a large entanglement entropy between spins and dipoles, which is far beyond the
(crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We also examine the stability of QSDL with respect
to perturbations and discuss implications for experiments in H-Cat and its deuterated analog D-Cat.

INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen bonds occupy a unique position in con-
densed matter physics, where we can expect a huge
quantum paraelectricity due to its lightness.
Most
hydrogen-bonded systems so far were treated within the
(crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where we ig-
nore quantum entanglement between atomic motion and
electronic states.
However, recently it was recognized
that in many hydrogen-bonded materials quantum na-
ture of protons plays an essential role and even aﬀects
basic properties of the system1–6. Indeed, protons can
tunnel quantum mechanically between two stable posi-
tions of the O–H· · · O bonding and furthermore the hy-
drogen bonds are subject to the ice rule due to the frus-
tration in a wide range of systems, including ferroelectric
KH2PO44,7, hexagonal water ice5,8, and molecular crys-
tals6,9,10.
Recently, a new member of hydrogen-bonded mate-
rials, purely organic κ-H3(Cat-EDT-TTF)2 (called H-
Cat), was synthesized11–19.
H-Cat has a quasi-two-
dimensional (2D) triangular lattice structure of dimers
with moderate interlayer coupling, and each layer is con-
nected by hydrogen bonds which also form a triangular
lattice. Experimentally, protons are unfrozen down to the
lowest temperature and the observed quantum paraelec-
tricity can be attributed to proton tunneling16. In stark
contrast to the other hydrogen-bonded materials, H-Cat
is shown to be a dimer Mott insulator, where we can
expect strong electron correlation. Moreover, in H-Cat,
spins delocalized over the π-conjugated orbital are also
ﬂuctuating without any magnetic order below a temper-
ature scale close to that of the quantum proton motion.
This implies that a quantum liquid state of unknown type
is realized in H-Cat, where both protons and electrons are
quantum mechanically disordered simultaneously and are
strongly entangled with each other, which makes this ma-
terial far beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approx-
imation. On the other hand, the deuterated counterpart
D-Cat exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below
185 K, where protons and electrons together show a cou-
pled charge order, indicating strong Coulomb interaction
between them11,13,16. Thus, such a large isotope eﬀect
strongly suggests that the proton tunneling is responsi-
ble for the possible hybrid quantum liquid state in H-Cat.
However, it is unclear why proton and spin ﬂuctuations
can coexist in a quantum liquid state.
The triangular lattice of H-Cat is a prototypical ex-
ample of frustrated lattices and such a frustrated lattice
can impose constraints on proton and spin conﬁgurations,
leading to macroscopic degeneracy at a classical level.
Quantum ﬂuctuations could potentially realize a quan-
tum liquid state out of the degenerate classical states as
originally proposed in Anderson’s theory of the resonat-
ing valence bond (RVB) state20–22. The basic mechanism
of realizing a quantum liquid was later employed in the
theory of quantum spin/water ice where the RVB state is
exactly realized by tuning a system into the exactly solv-
able Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point21–26. This observation
would imply that both the electron spin liquid and the
proton dipole liquid can be treated in a uniﬁed manner
to describe a spin-dipole coupled quantum liquid.
In this paper, motivated by the experimental discovery
of H-Cat, we present a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid
state, quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL), in hydrogen-
bonded electron systems by combining the concepts of
Anderson’s RVB state of electron spins and a quantum
ice of protons. Although a hybrid quantum spin liquid
itself is discussed in the literature27–33, including spin-
charge coupled purely electron systems without hydrogen
bonds34–38, its entangled nature has never been discussed
in detail. In our theory, the RVB state is extended to de-
scribe the entanglement between spins and dipoles. We
give a simple concrete description of the QSDL based on
a minimal model which incorporates three key features of
the QSDL, i.e. macroscopic classical degeneracy, quan-

tum proton tunneling, and electron correlations.
The
resulting QSDL is named quantum valence bond ice, and
the property of this state will be discussed in detail from
analytical and numerical perspectives. Though this uni-
ﬁed theory does not explain everything observed in H-
Cat, especially the absence of a spin gap16, we can un-
derstand some basic diﬀerence between H-Cat and D-Cat
based on a universal nature of a quantum liquid. Thus,
while the model itself is idealized to some extent, it can
give a clear physical picture of the state of the state ob-
served in H-Cat.

MODEL
Since the primary purpose of the present study is to
present a ﬁrm basis for hybrid spin liquids, it is desirable
to introduce an appropriate model which is inspired by
the candidate material H/D-Cat. First, we focus on the
electron sector of H/D-Cat where there are two inequiva-
lent dimers (four sites) in the unit cell, and thus consider
an idealized model where tetramers are introduced as a
fundamental unit of the system.
The tetramer would
be regarded as a pair of dimers, and therefore the model
can describe not only QSDL relevant to an H-bonded sys-
tem but also a CDW state corresponding to a D-bonded
system on an equal footing, as seen in H/D-Cat. Our
Hamiltonian contains both holes and protons, and is de-
ﬁned by

The holes are described by the t–J model where dou-

action39: a real tel is a hole hopping parameter inside a
tetrahedron denoted by ⊠, and Jel > 0 is a spin-spin ex-

the hole and the proton. We will later extend the model
Eq. (1) and discuss eﬀects of an additional proton-proton
interaction and intertetrahedron hole hopping.
To be concrete, we consider a range of model parame-
ters by referring to H/D-Cat. Since the dimer Mott in-
sulator H-Cat is a one-hole-ﬁlled system11,13,16,18,19, we
consider two-hole ﬁlling for each tetrahedron which is a
counterpart with the same ﬁlling in our model. Essen-
tially the same argument can also be applied for a two-
electron ﬁlling system. While Hel has a form of the t–J
model, Hpro is a transverse-ﬁeld Ising model on the frus-
trated pyrochlore lattice, and related models have been
investigated as a model for quantum spin liquids21–26. g
is supposed to be very large, i.e. g ∼O(103–4) K, because
it comes from strong Coulomb repulsion.
Jpro is also
large enough, i.e. Jpro ∼O(100) K, which is taken from
the antiferroelectric transition temperature in D-Cat. In
addition, we suppose |tpro| ≪Jpro and |tel| ≪g by re-
ferring to the parameters in H-Cat where tpro ∼1–10 K
and tel ∼10–100 K11,16,18,19,40, which allows a perturba-
tion theory with respect to tpro. The magnetic coupling
is assumed to be Jel ∼10–100 K taken from the value for
H-Cat, and one can focus only on the singlet sector of a
tetrahedron when the temperature is well below Jel. This
means that we consider a spin gapped state for simplic-
ity, but our theory is applicable even to the triplet sector
just by replacing singlets by triplets, and thus our theory
can be extended to the case where a spin gap is zero. In
addition, a gauge mean-ﬁeld theory is known to describe
a fermionic excitation from an ice state41, which would
potentially describe the observed exotic excitations16.3
III.
ANALYSIS OF GROUND STATE
A.
QSDL as a U(1) quantum liquid
In this section, the ground state of the Hamiltonian
Eq. (1) is discussed by mapping it to a quantum ver-
tex model based on a perturbation theory. In the case
of tpro = 0, the Hamiltonian is exactly solvable and the
ground states are degenerate for all proton conﬁgurations
obeying the ice rule. In the limit of tel/g →0, the proton
conﬁguration completely couples to the valence bonds of
hole pairs, and the position of the valence bond is ﬁxed
inside each tetrahedron in the ground states. Since the
valence bonds also form an ice conﬁguration, this state
may be called classical valence bond ice. This basically
holds true even for a nonzero tel where one can diagonal-
ize the electron Hamiltonian of each tetrahedron in the
valence bond basis and the ground state of a tetrahedron
will be a dressed valence bond state with a ﬁnite excita-
tion gap ∼g. Thus, every degenerate ground state of the
total system at tel ̸= 0 is adiabatically connected from
that at tel = 0.
We now introduce a quantum tunneling of protons
tpro ̸= 0, which will lift the macroscopic degeneracy of the
classical ground states in the same way as in the quan-
tum spin ice21–26. We can treat the eﬀects of tpro when
|tpro|/Jpro ≪1 by using the degenerate perturbation the-
ory. Though essentially the same argument is true for a
moderate tel, we assume the condition |tel|/g ≪1, which
makes a physical picture clear. Then, if a proton moves
from its ground state position to break the ice rule, a
hole in the nearby tetrahedron will be pushed away from
the proton because of the repulsive interaction g between
them. In this way, the proton motion is always accom-
panied by the hole hopping inside a tetrahedron and vice
versa.
We note that such a charge-correlated hopping
leads to eﬀective coupling between spins and protons de-
spite the absence of an explicit spin-orbit interaction. In
this sense, spin ﬂuctuations and proton ﬂuctuations are
tightly connected with each other, which will eventually
lead to the QSDL state. A nontrivial contribution ap-
pears from the 6th-order perturbation in tpro/Jpro. This
process results in the following eﬀective Hamiltonian in
addition to a constant energy shift of the degenerate
ground states,

tions are also shown. All arrows obey the ice rule.
for details).
The eﬀective Hamiltonian Eq. (5) is formally equiv-
alent to the quantum ice model, which has been exten-
sively studied in the context of the quantum spin ice21–26.
We stress, however, that the physical constituents of the
low energy degrees of freedom |⟲⟩, |⟳⟩are very diﬀer-
ent from those in the quantum spin ice; they are spin-
dipole coupled degrees of freedom in the former, while
solely spins in the latter.
The ground state of the ef-
fective Hamiltonian is known to be the quantum liquid
state, which is described by an emergent compact U(1)
electromagnetic ﬁeld which is deconﬁned in 3 + 1 di-
mensions. Thus, we have theoretically established that
the quantum proton motion can indeed drive the system
into a QSDL, namely the quantum valence bond ice, and
form a stable three-dimensional (3D) phase. It is stressed
that both spins and protons are unfrozen simultaneously,
forming a hybrid liquid state.
The coupled spins and
dipoles behave as gapless “photons” of the emergent U(1)
gauge theory, while local proton excitations which break
the ice rule with an energy gap ∼Jpro are regarded as
“monopoles”21–26.
One of the most characteristic features of the QSDL
is a large entanglement between protons and holes. The
corresponding entanglement entropy deﬁned by SEE =
−Trel ρel log ρel with ρel = Trpro |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| for the ground
state |Ψ⟩can provide essential information of its entan-
glement structure. Now one can estimate that SEE ∼
log(the number of ﬂippable ice states) = O(Ntot), where
Ntot = Npro +Nel and Npro/el is the total number of pro-
ton bonds/electron sites. This is easily understood for
example based on the explicit calculation of SEE for the
Rokhsar-Kivelson state42 (see Appendix B). Therefore,
the QSDL has an entanglement entropy with a volume
law in contrast to the area law for a real space bipar-
tition43,44. Such a large entanglement between protons
and holes is an intrinsic nature of the QSDL, which is far
beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation.4

Stability of QSDL
Up to here, we have been based on the idealized model
Eq. (1) where a minimal number of terms are included
to describe the QSDL. However, we can consider addi-
tional terms in general, and considerations on such terms
are important to discuss the relevance of our model to
real materials. Here, we try to study the stability of the
QSDL by introducing two types of perturbations into the
model Eq. (1); (i) an additional interaction between pro-
tons which favors a classical order by lifting the macro-
scopic degeneracy of protons, and (ii) an intertetrahe-
dron hole hopping which may also lift the macroscopic
degeneracy of electrons. The following discussions will
be supplemented with numerical calculations later.
First, we examine eﬀects of additional proton inter-
actions such as J′
pro
P σz
ijσz
kl shown in Fig. 1(b), and
discuss implications for the qualitative diﬀerence in X-
Cat (X = H, D). The additional interaction lifts the
macroscopic degeneracy of the classical ground states,
and an inﬁnitesimal J′
pro will lead to an ordered state
when tpro = 0 by the order-by-disorder mechanism. In-
deed, classical (tpro = 0) spin ice models with additional
interactions have been extensively studied, where several
ordered states are stabilized depending on types of the
additional interactions45,46.
In the present system, we
consider J′
pro interaction which favors an antiferroelec-
tric (AFE) state of protons, but it competes with the
quantum tunneling tpro9,22,41. Based on these observa-
tions, one can draw a schematic phase diagram of the
perturbed model with both J′
pro and tpro as shown in
Fig. 3(a), where the QSDL with a large entanglement
entropy remains stable for J′
pro ≪K, while the AFE
state with a small entanglement is favored for J′
pro ≫K.
Note that, because g ≫|tel|, holes simultaneously show
a valence bond solid (VBS) state corresponding to the
proton AFE state when J′
pro ≫K. Experimentally, an H
bond will have a larger tpro and hence a larger K than
a D bond. Therefore, an H-bonded system can exhibits
a QSDL, while a D-bonded system shows a classically
ordered AFE/VBS state.
This is a generic feature of
proton-driven quantum liquids and therefore may be rel-
evant to the experimentally observed isotope eﬀect in X-
Cat, where H-Cat is a QSDL while D-Cat exhibits an
AFE CDW order11,13,16. The observed isotope eﬀect can
be attributed to this competition. Note that, according
to the previous studies of the pyrochlore spin liquids47,48,
a suﬃciently large tpro will lead to the trivial polarized
state of protons where they are simply aligned in the
direction of the “transverse ﬁeld”, which is nothing but
the proton tunneling tpro. In this state, the proton sector
will be decoupled from the electron sector, resulting in
vanishing entanglement between them. This state is not
a quantum liquid state, although the protons are ﬂuc-
tuating in the σz basis. We observed reduction of the
entanglement entropy for tpro/Jpro ≳1 in our numerical
calculations of the ﬁnite size system (not shown). How-
ever, the polarized proton state seems irrelevant to H-Cat
since tpro is estimated to be 1-10 K and tpro ≪Jpro is
easily satisﬁed16.
Next, we consider the intertetrahedron hole hopping
along the hydrogen bonds, t′
el
P
⟨ij⟩c†
iσcjσ as shown in
Fig. 1(b), within a perturbative regime |t′
el| ≪|tel|. The
intertetrahedron hole hopping will induce several possible
interactions between the valence bonds on neighboring
tetrahedra. To see this, we consider an extended Hub-
bard model of holes from which the t–J model in Eq. (1)
is derived. The Hubbard Hamiltonian for holes is

where t′
el is an intertetrahedron hopping along a hydrogen

an intersite interaction within each tetrahedron.
The 2nd order perturbation in Ht gives rise to several
terms,

The
ﬁrst term is an exchange interaction inside each tetrahe-
dron, which is included in Eq. (1), while the other two
terms are new intertetrahedron interactions. Suﬃciently
large U ≫|tel| and V ≫|t′
el| lead to constraints on
possible hole ﬁlling so that ni ≤1 for all sites i, and
P
i∈⊠ni = 2 for each tetrahedron assuming quarter
ﬁlling of holes. The resulting state can be considered as
a “tetramer Mott insulator”, as expected.5

In the following, we only consider a singlet-pair state of
holes on each tetrahedron since there is an energy gap
∼Jel ≫J′
el, J′′
el between singlet and triplet states. We
note that −(Jel/4) P
i,j∈⊠ninj terms do not matter in
the present system where the total fermion number inside
a tetrahedron ⊠is ﬁxed.
The J′
el term is nonzero only when both of the two sites
connected by the hydrogen bond ⟨i, j⟩are occupied, and
similarly the J′′
el term is nonzero only when one of the two
sites connected by the hydrogen bond is occupied. Eﬀects
of the J′
el term will be strongly suppressed by a large in-
teraction g ≫J′
el between holes and protons included in
the original model, because of the energy cost due to g
for a conﬁguration favored by J′
el. On the other hand, the
J′′
el term eﬀectively adds to the interaction g, because the
J′′
el-term also favors common local charge conﬁgurations
as the g term does. Therefore, these two potential in-
teractions between singlet pairs on the nearest-neighbor
tetrahedra could eﬀectively be absorbed into the interac-
tion g, or equivalently the intratetrahedron hopping tel.
Then, it is concluded that thanks to the stability of the
QSDL for a wide range of tel/g, the QSDL is also stable
with respect to the intertetrahedron hopping t′
el. This be-
havior is numerically conﬁrmed by exact diagonalization
in the next section.
C.
Numerical calculations
The above discussions on the stability can be supple-
mented by numerical calculations using exact diagonal-
ization for a ﬁnite-size system with perturbations, such
as the J′
pro term. To this end, we consider a 2D version of
our model Eq. (1) which consists of 8 proton bonds and
16 electron sites (8 holes) with a periodic boundary con-
dition. Although the system size is very small, this model
can reproduce much of the main results in the previous
sections and thus supports the above discussions. The
Hamiltonian used in the numerical exact diagonalization
is written as
Htot = H + Hpert,
(10)
where H is a two-dimensional (2D) version of Eq. (1),
in which tetrahedra are located on vertices of a square
lattice as shown in Fig. 4. Hpert describes perturbations,

18 ice states at tpro = J′
pro = J′
el = J′′
el = 0, and 16 are
connected by the 2nd order perturbation in tpro. The 2nd
order tunneling is possible because the linear system size
for one direction is 2 and the periodic boundary condi-
tion has been imposed. Furthermore, the conservation
of the total spin for each tetrahedron, [H, S⊠] = 0 for
S⊠= P
i∈⊠Si, greatly reduces the computational cost
for the unperturbed Hamiltonian H. Taking this advan-
tage, we focus only on the subspace where S⊠= 0 for ev-
ery tetrahedron also for the perturbed Hamiltonian Htot,
since there is an energy gap ∼Jel between the S⊠≡0
sector and other sectors in H. From now on, we omit Jel
because the triplet sectors of the original Hilbert space
are all projected out.
When J′
pro is moderately strong, the 2D model shows
an AFE state of the protons and the holes simultane-
ously form a VBS state for a large g. This state will have
a corresponding long range order in the thermodynamic
limit. On the other hand, for a small J′
pro, it can exhibit
a QSDL-like state which is a superposition of many ﬂip-
pable ice states. Indeed, we ﬁnd that out of the total
N = 18 ice states there are Nﬂip = 16 ice states, which6
are connected by the lowest order perturbation in tpro.
The QSDL-like state is essentially given by a superposi-
tion of these 16 reduced ice states. The AFE/VBS state
is clearly distinguished from the QSDL-like state even
in the present ﬁnite-size system, which is well-captured
by the entanglement entropy SEE(tpro, J′
pro) between pro-
tons and holes. The entanglement entropy is given by

The results are shown in Fig. 3(b) where the two ground
states, AFE/VBS and QSDL states, are well character-
ized by SEE. The saturated value SEE ≃log 16 for a large
tpro means that the ground state is essentially given by
the superposition of 16 ﬂippable ice states with a nearly
equal weight, and the ground state can be considered as
a QSDL in this sense.
Note that the QSDL is a sta-
ble phase extended in the parameter space, although it
is parametrically small as expected from other quantum
ice systems. In the limit of tpro →0, the ground state
is given by a superposition of simple AFE/VBS states
with fourfold degeneracy due to the translational and ro-
tational symmetries. Therefore, SEE(tpro →0) →log 4
for such a state, while SEE →log Nﬂip = log 16 deeply in-
side the QSDL region with a moderately large tpro. This
qualitatively reproduces the phase diagram in Fig. 3(a)
proposed to describe the diﬀerence between H-Cat and
D-Cat.
In the 3D thermodynamic system, Nﬂip, N ∼eNtot
and the present QSDL-like state will be replaced by a
true quantum liquid state where a macroscopic number
of ice states are involved, resulting in a large entangle-
ment entropy, SEE ∼Ntot. Note that similar crossover
behaviors in the ﬁnite size system can also be seen in cor-
relation functions, and those quantities will characterize
the corresponding phase transition in the thermodynamic
limit. We can also discuss the eﬀects of an intertetra-
hedron hopping t′
el, and numerical results suggest that
induced intertetrahedron valence bond interactions have
only small eﬀects on QSDL if |t′
el| ≪|tel|, and QSDL is
parametrically stable. Detailed studies on the stability of
QSDL would require more elaborate investigations, such
as cluster-based calculations49, and are left for a future
study.
Similar characterization is also possible by correlation
functions corresponding to the long-range order of the
AFE and VBS. We consider the following two order pa-
rameters,
OAFE =

where ηij = ±1 characterizes the proton AFE conﬁgura-
tion and |VBS⊠⟩is the VBS conﬁguration of the holes on
a tetrahedron corresponding to the proton AFE shown
in 4(b).
The calculation results are shown in Fig. 5.

The other parameters used are tpro = 0.2Jpro, J′
pro = 0.
SEE(g, J′
el) is only slightly decreased by the introduction
of J′
el, because it competes with g, but is negligible for a
large g. SEE(g, J′′
el) is a little enhanced by J′′
el, since it fa-
vors valence bond conﬁgurations including the ﬂippable
ice states. These behaviors are consistent with the qual-
itative discussion in the previous section. Therefore, the
QSDL is parametrically stable for a small intertetrahe-
dron hole hopping t′
el.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
We have developed a theory of a hybrid quantum liq-
uid, QSDL, by combining the quantum proton ice and
Anderson’s RVB state, motivated by the recent experi-
mental discovery of the quantum spin liquid with pro-
ton ﬂuctuations in H-Cat.
We proposed an idealized7

model and demonstrated that proton tunneling drives
the system into the quantum valence bond ice, a QSDL
described by an emergent U(1) gauge theory. Our theory
sheds light on the essential roles of protons in the realiza-
tion of QSDLs by proposing a coherent understanding of
spin-dipole coupled systems, and thus can provide a ba-
sis for future developments not only for X-Cat but also
for other QSDL candidate systems31,50. For example, a
hydrogen-assisted Kitaev spin liquid material H3LiIr2O6
was recently discovered31, and proton tunneling is sug-
gested to be important to stabilize the quantum spin liq-
uid51–54. In addition, although we have been based on
the idealized model Eq.(1) to elucidate the impacts of
H-bonds, such a model itself could be designed in metal-
organic frameworks (MOF). Indeed, there are a variety
of H-bonded MOFs and nature of the H-bonds have been
discussed extensively55,56. Realization of an ideal system
for a hybrid quantum liquid by utilizing the ﬂexibility of
MOFs would be an interesting future direction.
The large entanglement predicted by our theory char-
acterizes a QSDL in general, and it would lead to spin-
dipole coupled dynamics such as a magnetoelectric ef-
fect, which could provide an experimental signature of
the entangled spins and protons. Other experimentally
observable quantities characterizing a QSDL are dynam-
ical ones, which can be captured by neutron scattering or
nuclear magnetic resonance. Further investigation is nec-
essary to discover a smoking gun signature for the strong
entanglement between the two degrees of freedom.

Appendix A: Derivation of a quantum ice model
Here we derive the eﬀective low-energy Hamiltonian
Eq. (5) from the original Hamiltonian Eq. (1), based on
the degenerate perturbation theory with respect to tpro.
The 6th order perturbation in tpro gives
Heﬀ= PVt
1 −P
E0 −H0
Vt · · · Vt
1 −P
E0 −H0
VtP,
(A1)
where we decompose the original Hamiltonian H(tpro)
given by Eq. (1) into H(tpro) = H0 + Vt, and H0 =
H(tpro = 0). P is a projection operator onto the degen-
erate ice state manifold with an energy E0.
Though an intratetrahedron hole hopping tel has been
included in H0 and the perturbation itself is done for
a small tpro/Jpro, we concentrate on a principal con-
tribution coming from the lowest order of tel/g. To do
this, we take a basis set consisting of product states of
hole and proton sectors {|pro⟩⊗|el⟩}. Each hole state
|el⟩can be explicitly obtained by diagonalizing the hole
Hamiltonian of each tetrahedron for a given proton con-
ﬁguration |pro⟩. By inserting an identity operator, 11 =
P |pro⟩⊗|el⟩⟨pro| ⊗⟨el| , we ﬁnd for two ﬂippable ice
states |a⟩, |b⟩,
hab ≃−12t6
pro(21J3 + 118GJ2 + 214G2J + 120G3)
(J + G)3(J + 2G)2(J + 3G)(J + 4G)(J + 5G)
× ⟨ela|elb⟩
(A2)
where hab
= ⟨a|Heﬀ|b⟩, J
= 4Jpro, and G = 2g.
|ela(b)⟩is the hole wavefunction in the ice state a(b).
The overlap matrix element can be calculated numer-
ically and is O(t6
el/g6) for a small |tel| as shown in
Fig. 7. Amplitude of the overlap takes the same value
for any pair of electron states connected by the 6th or-
der perturbation of tpro, and therefore we simply de-
note K ≡−hab to obtain Eq. (5) in the main text as
Heﬀ= −K P |a⟩⟨b| . The eﬀective Hamiltonian can ex-
plicitly be expressed in terms of hole operators c(†)
is , and
|ela⟩⟨elb| = Q
plaquette c†
iscjs
(i, j ∈⊠) is simply a ring-
hopping operator for each hexagonal plaquette loop in
the leading order of the perturbation in tel/g.

Appendix B: Entanglement entropy for the
Rokhsar-Kivelson state
The entanglement entropy between protons and elec-
trons can be calculated explicitly for an extreme limit
of a quantum spin-dipole liquid (QSDL), the Rokhsar-
Kivelson (RK) state. The RK state is the exact ground
state of the ice model Eq. (5) in the main text with an
additional potential µ P[|⟲⟩⟨⟲| + |⟳⟩⟨⟳|] ﬁne-tuned to
µ = K. The RK state is a superposition of all possi-
ble ice states, |RK⟩= (1/
√
N) P
C |proC⟩⊗|elC⟩, where
C represents an ice conﬁguration and N is the dimen-
sion of the ice manifold.
|proC⟩and |elC⟩are proton
and electron wavefunctions for a ﬁxed ice conﬁguration
C. The entanglement entropy between protons and holes
is given by SEE = log N and it obeys a clear volume law
SEE = O(Ntot).
