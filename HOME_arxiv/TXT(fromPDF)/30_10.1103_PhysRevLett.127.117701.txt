We describe a tunneling spectroscopy technique in a double bilayer graphene heterostructure
where momentum-conserving tunneling between diﬀerent energy bands serves as an energy ﬁlter
for the tunneling carriers, and allows a measurement of the quasi-particle state broadening at well
deﬁned energies. The broadening increases linearly with the excited state energy with respect to
the Fermi level, and is weakly dependent on temperature.
In-plane magnetotunneling reveals a
high degree of rotational alignment between the graphene bilayers, and an absence of momentum
randomizing processes.
Energy resolved lifetime measurements provide unique
insight into the fundamental relaxation mechanisms of
quantum states in a material. The carrier lifetime, the
inverse of quasi-particle state broadening is however elu-
sive to transport, which probes primarily momentum re-
laxation. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [1–
3] has been generally used to been used to extract the
state carrier lifetime, and in certain conditions scanning
tunneling spectroscopy can probe the carrier lifetimes
for discrete states, such as Landau levels in graphene
[4]. The tunneling spectra between two closely spaced
two-dimensional (2D) layers oﬀers a unique tool to probe
lifetimes of carriers with continuously varying energies
above and below the Fermi surface. Quantum tunneling
is an energy conserving phenomenon, and in translation
invariant systems where momentum is a good quantum
number in both layers, momentum-conserving tunneling
leads to resonances in the interlayer tunneling conduc-
tance [5–7]. Studies in in GaAs double quantum wells
of electrons [8, 9] and holes [10, 11] shed light on Fermi
surface properties and carrier lifetime.
In this letter, we use momentum-conserving tunnel-
ing between two rotationally aligned graphene bilayers,
henceforth referred to as bilayers, to investigate quasi-
particle state broadening in the individual bilayers, as a
function of energy and temperature. We use magnetotun-
neling spectroscopy to conﬁrm the high degree rotational
alignment of the two bilayers, and determine the bilayer
spatial separation.
The data reveal the quasi-particle
state broadening increases linearly with the state energy
separation from the Fermi level, and is relatively insen-
sitive to temperature, which in turn suggests the quasi-

particle state broadening at the Fermi level is disorder
limited, and at excited states is dominated by carrier-
carrier interactions or phonon emission.
The two bilayers are deﬁned from a large-area single
crystal using electron-beam lithography (EBL) and O2
plasma etching, which ensures crystallographic alignment
from the outset of fabrication. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a
heterostructure consisting of double bilayers separated by
a few-layer thick WSe2 tunnel barrier is created by using
a polymer stamp to pick up and stack individual layers,
while maintaining the original rotational orientation of
the bilayers [12]. Multiple independent contacts to each
bilayer, and metal top and bottom gates are deﬁned using
EBL and metal evaporation.
The dual-gate geometry
allows for independent control of the charge densities in
each bilayer. We consider here two heterostructures, one
with a two-layer WSe2 (Device #1) and one with a three-
layer WSe2 (Device #2) tunnel barrier.
As we will show in this study, using a combination
of measurements and calculations, the carriers tunnel-
ing between the graphene bilayers conserve both energy
and momentum thanks to the accurate rotational align-
ment of the two bilayers.
To gain an insight into the
measured interlayer tunneling currents (IIL), we use a
single-particle tunneling model [8, 13, 14].

We compute the energy dispersion εk,s within each bi-
layer using a pz orbital-based tight-binding model [15],
with the parameters of Ref. [16], without including the
trigonal warping. We self-consistently model the band-
gaps within the bilayers in the presence of transverse
electric ﬁelds [17].

potentials of the top (φTL) and bottom (φBL) bilayers,
which control the relative alignment of the energy bands
are calculated using a capacitive model [14] (Table I).

Figure 1 (c) shows an example of the measured inter-
layer tunneling conductance gIL = ∂IIL/∂VIL as a func-
tion of VIL and VTG, at VBG = 25 V and a temperature
T = 1.5 K. The data reveal a set of resonances, marked
by gIL maxima, which form nearly linear contours in the
VIL-VTG plane.
The bilayers’ bands and chemical po-
tentials at six representative points labelled (i)-(vi) are
shown in Fig. 1 (d). The black-dotted line in Fig. 1 (c)
corresponds to the primary resonance, where the bands
of the two bilayers align [Fig. 1 (d)(i)]. For a general bi-
asing condition the bands of the top and bottom bilayers
are misaligned, and momentum-conserving tunneling is
suppressed except at particular a energy (ε) correspond-
ing to a ring of states formed by the intersection of the
electron band of one bilayer and hole band of the other,
as depicted in Fig. 1 (b).
We refer to this regime as
unlike-band tunneling, as opposed to the like-band tun-
neling which controls the primary resonance in Fig. 1 (c).
Unlike-band tunneling is possible only if ε lies between
µTL and µBL. Along the two white-dotted lines in Fig.
1 (c), the ring of intersection at ε crosses into the inter-
val between µTL and µBL [Fig. 1 (d) (ii)-(vi)], leading to
secondary resonances in the tunneling conductance. Par-
ticularly, ε = µBL along the (iii)-(iv) line, and ε = µTL
along the (v)-(vi) line. Figure 1 (e) shows εφ, namely the

neutrality of the bilayer whose chemical potential is not
aligned with ε [Fig. 1(b)], as a function of VTG along the
lines (iii)-(iv) and (v)-(vi). The εφ values along (iii)-(iv)
are almost constant, indicating that along the (iii)-(iv)
contour carriers are injected to the same set of states in
the top bilayer.

VTG = 1.7 V and VBG = 25 V, adjusted so that the
carrier densities in the top (nTL), and bottom (nBL) bi-
layers are nTL = nBL = 1.7×1012 cm−2 at VIL = 0 V, and3
the primary resonance condition occurs at VIL = 0 V. A
ﬁt using Eqs. (1-3) around the primary resonance yields
Γ = 1 meV and t = 30 µeV. However, the model of Eqs.
(1-3) using a ﬁxed Γ = 1 meV does not accurately capture
the secondary resonances at VIL ≈±0.12 V, correspond-
ing to points (iv) and (v) in Fig. 1(c). Indeed, the widths
(peak values) of the secondary resonances are underesti-
mated (overestimated), indicating that the quasi-particle
state broadening varies depending on the energy or rela-
tive position to the chemical potential. Additional data
supporting this conclusion are presented in Fig. S1 of the
Supplementary Material.
Quasi-particle states can be broadened by relaxation
mechanisms, such as static disorder, phonon emission,
and carrier-carrier interactions. Their relative contribu-
tions depend on the state energy, band structure, chem-
ical potential, and temperature. Ignoring trigonal warp-
ing, Γ reduces to a function of the energy separation from
the Fermi surface (εµ = ε −µ) and the energy referenced
to the charge neutrality level (εφ = ε −φ) [Fig. 1(b)],
Γ ≡Γ(εµ, εφ). When the primary resonance occurs at
VIL = 0 V, the tunneling is restricted to a narrow range
of energies at the Fermi surfaces of the two bilayers, and
the width of the primary resonance can be used to extract
Γ = Γ(0, εφ).
The secondary resonances are particularly interesting,
as momentum-conserving unlike band tunneling creates
a ﬁlter for carrier injection at a single energy ε. Along
the (iii)-(iv) contour in Fig. 1(c), ε = µBL, and the con-
tributing values of broadening to transmission rate in (2)
correspond to Γ(µBL −µTL, µBL −φTL) of the top bi-
layer and Γ(0, µBL −φBL) of the bottom bilayer. There-
fore, by performing a ﬁt to the experimental data at the
secondary resonances we can extract the broadening of
quantum states away from the Fermi surface. In this case,
the bottom bilayer is either injecting particles into empty
states [point (iii)], or vacancies into ﬁlled states of the top
bilayer [point (iv)]. Similarly, along the (v)-(vi) contour
in Fig. 1(c), ε = µTL, which allows the extraction of the
bottom bilayer quantum state broadening. The model
ﬁts in Fig. 1(f) with Γ = 1 meV and Γ = 12 meV used
for the primary and secondary resonances, respectively,
are in excellent agreement with the experimental data.
Figure 2(a) shows the top bilayer Γ vs.
εµ, ex-
tracted from parameter ﬁts along (iii)-(iv) contour, at
various VBG.
As established in Fig.
1(e), εφ is con-
stant along (iii)-(iv) at a ﬁxed VBG. Therefore, the back-
gate bias provides an independent handle to vary the
εφ, and VBG = −30 V, −15 V, and 25 V correspond
to εφ ≈35 meV, 17 meV and −24 meV respectively.
Remarkably, Fig. 2(a) data show that Γ does not vary
signiﬁcantly with εφ. For ε > µTL (ε < µTL), the bottom
bilayer injects particles (vacancies) into the top bilayer,
and the extracted Γ corresponds to the particle (vacancy)
state broadening. Similarly, Fig. 2(b) shows the bottom
bilayer Γ vs. εµ, from parameter ﬁts along the (v)-(vi)
contour, at various VBG. We note that unlike the (iii)-

1(e)], concomitantly with εµ. Nonetheless, Fig. 2(a) and
(b) data are in good agreement, and show that the Γ val-
ues are largely controlled by εµ, and scale almost linearly
with εµ.
To understand the mechanism controlling the quasi-
particle state broadening, we also consider the Γ vs. T
dependence shown in Fig.
2(c,d).
The primary reso-
nance at the Fermi surface (εµ = 0) with nTL = nBL =
1.5×1012 cm−2 (εφ = 60 meV) exhibits a weak tempera-
ture dependence up to T = 100 K [Fig. 2(c)], which indi-
cates that it is controlled primarily by disorder, as acous-
tic phonon scattering leads to a Γ ∝T or stronger depen-
dence [18, 19], and carrier-carrier interaction to a Γ ∝T 2
dependence [9, 11]. Figure 2(d) shows Γ vs. T away from
the Fermi surface, determined from the secondary reso-
nances at εµ = 80 meV. In both Fig. 2(c,d) data Γ is
nearly insensitive to T. Overall Fig. 2 data indicate that
Γ at the Fermi level is controlled by disorder in a wide
temperature range, and away from the Fermi level by
carrier-carrier interaction and phonon emission [20, 21].
We note that the relative contributions of carrier-carrier
interaction and phonon emission have yet to be clariﬁed
theoretically, and Fig. 2 data provide an experimental
point of comparison for such study.

ing measurements it is instructive to examine the role of
electron heating. Using a maximum dissipated power of 5
W/cm2 at the secondary resonances in our experiments,
we estimate the lattice temperature increase to be less
than 0.1 K [22, 23]. Following calculations similar to Ref.
[24] we ﬁnd that the diﬀerence between the electron and
lattice temperatures, controlled by the electron-phonon
coupling, to be less than 0.5 K in the range of biases used
to extract the Γ values. Since Γ is insensitive to temper-
atures up to 10 K, we conclude that Joule heating does
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the reported results.
A key ingredient in our analysis has been the assump-
tion of momentum-conserving tunneling enabled by the
rotational alignment of the two bilayers.
To validate
this hypothesis, we examine the tunneling characteris-
tics with an applied in-plane magnetic ﬁeld (B∥) [Fig.
3(a)], which adds a momentum to the tunneling carrier
[25, 26] [Fig. 3(b-c)]:
ℏ∆K = e tIL(ˆz × B∥),
(4)
and leads to a splitting of the primary resonance [Fig.
3(d-f)]; tIL is the tunneling distance, and ˆz the unit vector
perpendicular to the sample plane.
Figures 3(g) and 3(i) show the measured gIL vs. VIL for
Devices #1 and #2, respectively, at various B = |B∥|,
T = 1.5 K, and at biasing conditions such that the pri-
mary resonance is at VIL = 0 V. In both panels, the data
show a clear splitting of the resonance with increasing B,
with the two peaks occur at the band alignment condi-
tions of Figs. 3(d) and 3(f). Figures 3(h) and 3(j) show
the calculated gIL for the same set of VIL and B as in
Figs. 3(g) and 3(i), respectively. Figure S2 of the Sup-
plementary Material expands the comparison of the ex-
perimental and calculated gIL vs. VIL and VTG in Device
#1. The applied B∥enters Eq. (3) as a wave-vector shift
between the top and bottom bilayers kTL −kBL = ∆K.
While we account for the bilayers energy bandstructure
change in the presence of B∥according to Ref. [27], no
appreciable changes in the model results are observed in
the B-range experimentally explored. By matching the
calculated resonance splitting as a function of B we ex-
tract a tunneling distance tIL = 2.3 nm and tIL = 3.4 nm
for Devices #1 and #2, respectively. These values are
in good agreement with the tunnel barriers of two and
three WSe2 layers for Devices #1 and #2, respectively,
albeit larger than the expected tunnel barrier thickness.
We note that including the trigonal warping in the bi-
layer graphene bandstructure does not change the gIL
values at B = 0 T, but does lead to additional features
in the magnetotunneling characteristics (Fig. S3 of the
Supplementary Material).
Lastly, we address the impact of a small twist (θR)
between the top and bottom bilayers, which has a similar
eﬀect as applied B∥for small angles [28], and changes Eq.
(4) to: ℏ∆K = ˆz × (e tILB∥+ θRℏK). The momentum
shift is valley dependent in this case. Figure 3(l) shows
the calculated gIL vs. VIL for diﬀerent θR, corresponding
to the B = 0 T case of Fig. 3(j). We note here that even
a small, θR = 0.1◦twist between the top and bottom
layers is expected to introduce a signiﬁcant splitting of5
the resonance gIL peak. Because no splitting is observed
at B = 0 T in the experimental data of Fig. 3(g) and
Fig. 3(i), we conclude that both Device #1 and #2 have a
high degree of rotational alignment between the bilayers.
In summary, we describe a spectroscopy technique
where momentum-conserving tunneling between diﬀer-
ent bands in a double layer heterostructure acts as an
energy ﬁlter, and allows the extraction of quasi-particle
state broadening at a well deﬁned energy with respect
to the Fermi level. The technique leverages advances in
van der Waals heterostructures fabrication with exquisite
control of rotational alignment, as demonstrated by in-
plane magnetotunneling.

FIG. S1. gIL vs. VIL (red dots) measured in Device #1 at T = 1.5 K. The primary resonance is tuned
to occur at VIL = 0 V for top (nTL) and bottom (nBL) bilayer densities (a) nTL = nBL = −1 × 1012
cm−2 at VTG = −0.6 V and VBG = −15 V (b) nTL = nBL = −2 × 1012 cm−2 at VTG = −1.4 V and
VBG = −30 V. The secondary resonances are visible at (a) VIL ≈±0.06 V and (b) VIL ≈±0.12 V.
The green-dotted (black-solid) line represents calculations with a constant (variable) broadening.
The right axis shows gIL normalized to the overlap area (σIL).

FIG. S3. (a) gIL vs. VIL at B = 0 T calculated with (green) and without (black) the inclusion of
trigonal warping parameter γ3 [1,2]. (b) gIL vs. VIL at B = 14 T calculated without inclusion of γ3.
The experimental data (red dots) measured in Device #1 at T = 1.5 K is shown for comparison in
panels (a) and (b). (c) gIL vs. VIL at B = 14 T calculated with the inclusion of γ3. In the presence
of trigonal warping, the magnetotunneling characteristics are expected to vary with the direction
of in-plane magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the bilayer graphene crystal axes.
