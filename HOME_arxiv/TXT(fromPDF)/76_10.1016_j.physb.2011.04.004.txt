ABSTRACT 
Total and partial density of states, frequency dependent complex refractive index including 
extinction coefficient, optical conductivity and transmission of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in rocksalt 
and wurtzite phases are calculated using full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-
LAPW) method. The real part of refractive index decreases while the extinction coefficient, 
optical conductivity and transmission for rocksalt phase increases with the increase in Mg 
concentration. In wurtzite phase, ordinary and extraordinary indices decreases while extinction 
coefficient, optical conductivity and transmission increases in parallel as well as perpendicular to 
c-axis with the increase in the Mg concentration.Key Words: Optical properties; nonlinear optical properties; DFT; ZnO:Mg

1. Introduction 
ZnO is a key semiconductor compound with a wide bandgap, large binding energy and 
high chemical, mechanical and thermal stability [1]. It is intensively studied due to its numerous 
applications in sensors, transducers, catalysts, laser diodes, light emitting diodes, solar cells, heat 
mirrors, transparent electrodes, varistors, and surface acoustic wave devices [2-10]. While, MgO 
is another promising insulating metal oxide with various technological applications in different 
fields due to its very wide bandgap as well as thermal and chemical stability [11]. It is used as a 
substrate [12] and catalyst [13]. It is also used in superconductor products [14], thermal shock 
transducers, protecting layers for AC plasma display panels [15] and spintronics devices [16]. 
Mg doped ZnO is frequently used in optoelectronic and magneto-electronic devices [17-
22]. MgxZn1-xO in wurtzite and cubic rocksalt form has been grown experimentally using 
different experimental techniques [23-31]. Its structural, electronic, optical and thermal 
properties have been theoretically investigated by different ab-initio methods [22, 34-40]. But so 
far, no theoretical work has been reported on the refractive index optical conductivity and 
transmission of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys using density functional calculation. 
In the present work we extend the theoretical work of Amrani et al. [33] and Schleife et 
al.[40 ] to the ground state optical response of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in RS(B1) and WZ(B4) 
respectively, using Full- Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave Method with Perdew, 
Burke, Ernzerhof potential [41]  in the generalized gradient approximation. In optical responsewe discussed in details the optical properties; refractive index including extinction coefficient, 
optical conductivity and transmission of the alloy.  
 
2. Theory and calculations 
Optical properties provide useful information about the internal structure of a material. 
Wide range of physical properties of a ternary compound makes it more suitable than a binary 
compound for many technological applications. Keeping this in mind we investigate the 
refractive index, optical conductivity and transmission of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The refractive 
indices of ternary oxides are important optical design parameters, e.g. for distributed Bragg 
reflectors (DBRs) in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers [42].  
The complex refractive index is given by: 
                                               ̃             √

DFT has become an unchallenging “standard model” in material science due to its strong 
predictive power and successful results with wide applicability. We used DFT with the 
generalized gradient approximation [41] in the wien2k package to solve Kohan Sham equations 
using full potential linear augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) technique [46]. For the crystal 
potential, muffin-tin model was assumed. The unit cell was divided into two parts, within and 
outside the muffintin. The electrons density within the muffin-tin is core and outside is valance. 
The core electrons were treated relativistically, whereas the valence electrons were treated non-
relativistically. In both regions of the unit cell, different basis set were used to expand the wave 
function. A linear combination of radial solution of the Schrödinger equation times the spherical 
harmonics was used for the inside of the non-overlapping spheres of muffin-tin radius (RMT), 
around each atom. While plane wave basis set was used in the interstitial region. RMT was chosen 
in such a way that there was no charge leakage from the core and total energy convergence was 
ensured. RMT values of 1.87, 2.02, 1.79 a.u. were used for Mg, Zn and O. Inside the atomicspheres maximum value of angular momentum lmax = 10, was taken for the wave function 
expansion. For wave function in the interstitial region the plane wave cut-off value of  
Kmax = 7/ RMT   for binaries MgO and ZnO while 10 for ternaries Mg0.25Zn0.75O, Mg0.50Zn0.50O, 
Mg0.75Zn0.25O was used. A mesh of 4000 k-points for the MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in RS (B1) and 
550 for WZ (B4) were taken for the Brillouin zone integrations in the corresponding irreducible 
wedge to calculate optical properties.  
3. Results and Discussions: 
3.1. 
Density of states: 
Total and partial density of states for MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in RS and WZ phases are 
calculated and presented in Fig. 1. In the figure the density of states (DOS) for WZ phase are 
plotted, while due to the similar trend it is not shown for RS. In pure ZnO, the upper part of the 
valence band (VB) is mainly composed of Zn-3d states while the lower part of this band is 
occupied by O-2p states along with a noticeable contribution from the hybridization of Zn-3d 
and O-2p states. The mixing of valence states above the Fermi level forms the conduction band. 
For all the ternary alloys the distribution of the states are almost the same as of pure ZnO except 
Mg-3p states, which also contribute to CB. The figure also reveals that for pure MgO the major 
contribution to the VB and lower part of CB comes from O-2p states, while upper part of CB is 
mainly composed of Mg-3p states. The calculated DOS for the both phases of ZnO and MgO are 
in agreement with Ref. [35]. The trend in the DOS in the RS and the WZ is same however there 
are some small differences i.e. DOS in of the WZ are higher than the RS.  
3.2. 
Complex refractive index 
For accurate modeling and designing of optical materials for devices, knowledge of the 
dispersion of the refractive indices of the medium is necessary. Rocksalt (RS) materials havecubic symmetry and therefore have isotropic properties, while wurtzite structures (WZ) lack 
cubic symmetry and therefore have anisotropic optical properties. The anisotropy results in 
uniaxial birefringence in wurtzite compounds. The one in the parallel direction to the c-axis is 
called ordinary (no) while the perpendicular one is called extraordinary (ne) [5].  
The calculated frequency dependent refractive index for MgxZn1-xO, at x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 
0.75, and 1.0. is shown in Fig. 3. The critical points (zero frequency limits) of refractive indices 
at x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 are plotted against Mg concentration in Fig. 2 for rock salt (RS) 
and wurtzite (WZ) structures. It is clear from the figure that the refractive index for each 
structure decreases with the increase in magnesium concentration in the ZnO crystal. It is also 
clear from the plot that the refractive index for rock salt is higher than that for the wurtzite.  
In rock salt phase, the zero frequency limit of frequency dependent refractive index for 
pure ZnO is 1.95. It increases from 1.95 with the increase in energy and reaches to its maximum 
value (peak value) of 2.37 at 3.58 eV. On further increase in the incident photon energy beyond 
the peak value the refractive index of pure ZnO dissipates with somewhat oscillations. It falls 
below 1 in the range 16.31-47.58 eV except for 29.73-31.06 eV. For the wurtzite phase of ZnO, 
the refractive index remains isotropic except in the range 10-20 eV, with the zero frequency 
limits 1.797 for parallel and 1.808 for perpendicular to c-axis. The calculated refractive indexes 
at 0.4 eV are 1.80 and 1.81 corresponding to parallel and perpendicular to c-axis respectively 
which are closer to the experimental results 1.93 and 1.96 respectively [47]. Our calculated 
results for both, parallel and perpendicular parts of the refractive index are also in excellent 
agreement with the results of Yoshikawa and Adachi [48]. The refractive index for pure wurtzite 
ZnO falls below 1 in the range 14.92-47.52 eV for both axis. It is well established fact that, the 
group velocity of a wave packet in a medium travels faster than the speed of light (c) forrefractive index lesser than 1. Hence the group velocity is faster than c for rock salt ZnO in the 
range 16.31-47.58 eV except 29.73-31.06 eV and for wurtzite ZnO in the range 14.92-47.52 eV. 
In other words the group velocity shifts to negative domain and the material does not stay linear 
but becomes nonlinear for these energy ranges and hence becomes super luminous.  
By increasing the Mg concentration in ZnO for MgxZn1-xO, the peak value of the 
refractive index shifts towards higher energies for both the phases which is clear from Fig.2. 
When all the Zn atoms are replaced by Mg in the crystal, the peak value of the refractive index of 
the pure RS-MgO (1.89) occurs at 10.2 eV and WZ-MgO (1.67) at 6.1 eV. Our calculated 
ground state refractive index of RS-MgO, 1.55, is closer to the room temperature experimental 
refractive index, 1.72 [49].  Overall, by the change in the Mg concentration in the ZnO crystal, 
we can obtain different refractive indexes.  For zero frequency limits they range from 1.95 to 
1.55 in RS and, and for peak values they lie between 2.37 and 1.89, with the shift of energy from 
lower towards higher. Similarly, in WZ phase it varies from 1.797 to 1.428 parallel and 1.808 to 
1.438 perpendicular to the c-axis. 
Extinction coefficient against energy is also shown in Fig. 2 for both RS and WZ phases. 
Critical values for the extinction coefficient of MgxZn1-xO, at x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0 are; 1.6 
eV, 2.05 eV, 2.55 eV, 3.1 eV, 5.1 eV for RS phase while 1.2 eV, 1.7 eV, 2.06 eV, 2.8 eV, 5.8 eV 
for parallel as well as perpendicular to c-axis of the WZ phase. In pure RS-ZnO, the prominent 
peaks are at 12.4 eV and 16 eV. When we replace Zn by Mg in the RS-ZnO crystal, the positions 
of the peaks shifts towards higher energy values until all the Zn are replaced by Mg and it is 
noted that (for RS-MgO)  the prominent peaks are at 14.2 eV, 16.4 eV and 19.9 eV. It is further 
noted that the maximum peak in RS-ZnO is at 16.06 eV, while in RS-MgO it occurs at 19.87 eV.So by increasing Mg concentration in the RS-ZnO crystal, the overall response of the material to 
the applied energy field shifts towards higher energy in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.  
In WZ phase, the same trend is observed for the peak values of the extinction coefficient 
parallel to the c-axis from 14.84 eV to 17.62 eV while in the perpendicular part it decreases with 
the increase in the Mg concentration, from 13.67 eV to 12.20 eV. The anisotropy found in the 
parallel and perpendicular parts of the extinction coefficient for WZ-ZnO is in the range 6.8 eV 
to 17.5 eV and in WZ-MgO 6.89 eV to 29 eV, while the ternary alloys are isotropic for most of 
the energies. The calculated refractive index and extinction coefficient shows that MgxZn1-xO in 
both phases is suitable for optoelectronic applications in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.     
 
3.3.   Optical conductivity 
Optical conductivity, σ (ω), of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is shown in Fig. 4 for both phases. 
The critical points for MgxZn1-xO at x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0 are 2.6 eV, 3.05 eV, 3.5 eV, 4.12 
eV, 5.5 eV for RS phase and 1.3 eV, 2.06 eV, 2.65 eV, 3.68 eV, 5.80 eV for WZ phase. In pure 
RS-ZnO, there are three significant peaks at 12.6 eV, 15 eV and 31 eV with a maximum value of 
6882.79 (Ω. cm)-1 at 14.84 eV. The most interesting peak is the middle one, around 15 eV, which 
increases with the increase in the Mg concentration till 25 % and on further increase it starts 
decreasing. The peak around 20 eV is also appealing, as it increases with the increase in the Mg 
concentration and becomes prominent for pure RS-MgO. It is further noted that the maximum 
peak value of conductivity shifts from 14.84 eV to 19.6 eV.   
Similar trend are also observed for the optical conductivity parallel as well as 
perpendicular to c-axis. The maximum conductivity for WZ-ZnO is 6201.52 (Ω. cm)-1 at 13.18 
eV for parallel to c-axis and 6763 (Ω. cm)-1 at 13.59 eV for perpendicular to c-axis. While in theWZ-MgO, maximum conductivity parallel to c-axis is 4312.83 (Ω. cm)-1 at 16.37 eV and 
perpendicular to c-axis is 5188.04 (Ω. cm)-1 at 16.34 eV. Hence with the increase of Mg 
concentration, the peak value of the optical conductivity decreases and shifts towards higher 
energies for both parallel and perpendicular components to c-axis. The anisotropy observed in 
optical conductivity of WZ-ZnO is in the range 11.4 eV to 30 eV and WZ-MgO is 6.89 eV to 29 
eV, while the ternary compound MgxZn1-xO is almost isotropic.  
3.4.  Transmission 
Transmission spectra of MgxZn1-xO, for both phases, are calculated for the incident 
photon energies up to 7.0 eV using Eq. 6 and is plotted in Fig. 5. For RS-ZnO the transmission is 
almost 100% in the lower energies below 1 eV and then it starts decreasing exponentially and 
dies to zero near the absorption edge of the material. Similar trends are also observed for RS-
MgO as well as their ternary RS-Mg0.50Zn0.50O compounds.  For uniaxial WZ-MgxZn1-xO, the 
material remains isotropic in the range 0.0 eV – 7.0 eV for both transmissions parallel as well as 
perpendicular to c-axis. Transmission parallel to c-axis is plotted in Fig. 5. From plot it is clear 
that the exponential decrease in WZ-ZnO is faster than RS-ZnO but the transmission edge comes 
beyond RS-ZnO.  Similar trend is also observed for WZ-Mg0.50Zn0.50O. It is further noted from 
the figure that the transmission for both phases of MgO remains similar for most energies, while 
the transmission in WZ-MgO decays earlier than RS-MgO. For both phases the transmission 
increases with the Mg concentration in the ZnO crystal and the transmission edge shifts towards 
higher energies in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The results obtained from the present 
density functional calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured 
transmission of WZ-ZnO [31] and WZ-MgxZn1-xO [30] and are also in agreement with the 
experimental results of MgxZn1-xO in rocksalt and wurtzite [31].4. Conclusion 
Density of states, refraction, optical conductivity and transmission of MgxZn1-xO (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in 
rocksalt and wurtzite structures are theoretically investigated by FP-LAPW method. The 
calculated refractive index show that the material stays linear for energies lesser than 17eV in RS 
and 15 eV in WZ and becomes nonlinear beyond this. The increase of x in MgxZn1-xO crystal, 
suppresses the overall refraction and conductivity except for the sharp peak value around 19.90 
eV in RS and 16.3 eV in WZ, which enhances. Transmission of the alloy in both phases 
increases with the increase in Mg concentration. The high response of the compound in the 
energy range 10 eV to 20 eV confirms the importance of the material in the UV optoelectronic 
devices.
