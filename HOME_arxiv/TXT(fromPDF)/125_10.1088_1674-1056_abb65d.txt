We theoretically study the band structure and optical conductivity of twisted 
bilayer graphene (TBG) near the magic angle considering the effects of lattice 
relaxation. We show that the optical conductivity spectrum is characterized by a series 
of peaks associated with the van Hove singularities in the band structure, and the peak 
energies evolve systematically with the twist angle. Lattice relaxation effects in TBG 
modify its band structure, especially the flat bands, which lead to significant shifts of 
the peaks in optical conductivity. These results demonstrate that spectroscopic 
features in the optical conductivity can serve as fingerprints for exploring the band 
structure, band gap and lattice relaxation in magic angle TBG as well as identifying its 
rotation angle.

1.Introduction 
The various van der Waals heterostructures assembled from two-dimensional 
(2D) materials offer a unique platform combining many novel physical properties.[1-4] 
The high level of interest in 2D materials, combined with capabilities in device 
fabrication and experimental techniques, has led to an outburst of activity over the 
past few years. One of the simplest heterostructures is twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), 
which consists of two graphene layers rotationally stacked at an arbitrary angle θ to 
each other. In a small θ, a hexagonal long-period moiré interference pattern consisting 
of alternating AA- and AB-stacked regions emerges, owing to a slight difference in 
lattice orientation. When the twist angle θ is close to the ‘magic’ angle near 1.10°, [5] 
the electronic band structure becomes flat around the Dirac point at zero energy due to 
interlayer coupling.[6] The magic angle TBG has gained increased attention in theory 
and experiment in the last few years owing to its novel electronic properties. Recent 
studies on magic angle TBG have discovered correlated insulating phases with 
similarities to Mott insulator systems,[7] as well as strongly coupled superconducting 
states in ultra-flat bands close to half-filling.[8, 9] Furthermore, other intriguing 
quantum phenomena have been observed in magic angle TBG such as quantum 
anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). [10-14] These results make it possible to experimentally 
investigate both electronic correlations and topological phenomena in 2D van der 
Waals heterostructures. 
Spectroscopic studies of electronic phenomena are very important to explore the 
physical properties in graphene-based systems.[15, 16] Optical spectrum can provide 
critical information about the electronic band structure,[17, 
18] many-body 
interactions,[19, 20] quasiparticles[21] and collective excitations[22] in graphene systems. 
Moreover, graphene is very promising for applications in the field of optics[23] and 
optoelectronics[24] due to its unique mechanical, electric, magnetic and thermal 
properties. A multitude of exciting applications of graphene such as novel optical 
devices and photodetectors are being vigorously pursued by academia and industry. 
[25]  
Previously, the optical conductivity of TBG heterostructures has also been 
considered. Koshino et al. [26] systematically investigated the conductivity spectra of 
TBG with a variety of large rotation angle θ (from 1.47° to 30°). E. Bascones et al.[27] 
studied the effect of symmetry breaking states on the optical response, focusing on 
incident photon energy range below 50meV (corresponding wavelength λ≈25 um).Chinese Physics B 
Our results highlight the optical conductivity of magic angle TBG across a wider 
spectra range considering the effects of lattice relaxation, which is complementary to 
previous reports. In addition, another notable disagreement with previous results is 
that our results are more directly relevant to the experiment. At present, the area with 
uniform twist angle θ in TBG samples is only 3-5 um in size or even smaller, due to 
the constraints of device fabrication and experimental technology, which is about 10 
times smaller than the wavelength of incident photon (about 25 um) in Ref. [27]. 
Therefore, limited by the size of the TBG samples, it is difficult to compare the 
theoretical results of E. Bascones et al. with the experimental measurements in the 
short term. However, in this paper, we calculated the conductivity spectrum of TBG in 
the energy region from 0 to 1.0 eV and discussed in greater detail the very strong 
peaks in the frequency range from 0 to 0.4 eV (corresponding wavelength λ≈3 um) in 
the optical conductivity spectra. So our calculation results show the optical 
conductivity with higher incident energy (narrower incident wavelength), which can 
provide some reliable information for the experimental measurement of real TBG 
samples with small twist angle. 
Here, we study the low-energy band structure of TBGs at a series of small 
rotation angles θ around the magic angle based on an effective continuum model. The 
optical conductivity spectra are calculated based on the Kubo formula. At such small 
angles, the lattice structure of TBG spontaneously relaxes to minimize the energy of 
the structure, leading to significant modification in band structures. The dependence 
of different peaks in the optical conductivity spectrum on the rotation angle θ and 
lattice relaxation effect is fully explored. We study in detail how the van Hove 
singularities in DOS are related to different interband transitions. Our results show 
that optical measurements are very important for studying the band structure and 
lattice reconstruction in TBG. 
 
2. Theoretical model 
A TBG superlattice is illustrated in Fig. 1. When the relative twist angle θ of the 
two graphene monolayers is close to the magic angle, the period of moiré superlattice 
is much larger than the lattice constant of graphene a ≈ 0.246 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a, 
so an effective continuum model[26, 28, 29] can be used to describe the electronic band 
structure of TBG. Here we consider the TBG structure formed by the first and second 
layers of AA-stacked bilayer graphene, which rotate around the common B atom byChinese Physics B 
−θ/2 and +θ/2, respectively. Then, the lattice constant of the moiré superlattice is

The effective continuum model is constructed from a continuum electronic 
description of massless Dirac fermions in two graphene layers that are coupled by a 
slowly changing periodic inter-layer hopping.[6] The states near K  valley and those 
near

K  valley are far apart in the wave space when θ  is small, so the coupling 
between different valleys can be ignored. Near the K (

energy Hamiltonian includes the intra-layer Hamiltonian

the continuum model. In practice, however, in the small-twist regime the competition 
between the van der Waals interlayer interaction and the elastic energy at the interface 
can lead to significant relaxation of the lattice structure to reduce the area of AA 
region with high stacking energy.[31-37] The relaxed lattice forms an array of triangular 
domains with alternating AB- and BA-stacking regions.[38, 39] Moreover, lattice 
relaxation causes corrugation in the out-of-plane direction with increased vertical 
separation between the AA regions compared to that in AB regions.[31] The effects of 
lattice relaxation can be taken into account by using u  0.0797 eV and

3. Results and discussion 
Based on the effective continuum model described above, we calculate the 
electronic band structure of relaxed (black solid lines) and unrelaxed (red dashed lines) 
TBGs at three rotation angles θ (1.05°, 1.10° and 1.16°, respectively) close to the 
magic angle, as shown in Figure 2. Here, the path of band structures is along the line

 in the moiré Brillouin zone scheme, and the origin of the band 
energy axis (the band energy E = 0 eV) is set to the charge neutral point. Regardless 
of lattice reconstruction, a set of flat bands appears at the Dirac point due to the 
competition between the kinetic energy and the interlayer hybridization energy. For 
unreconstructed TBG, the flat bands are confined to less than about 15 meV, and theChinese Physics B 
bandwidth decreases with the increasement of twist angle θ. However, under the 
influence of lattice relaxation, the flat bands near the Dirac point are obviously 
gapped from the high energy bands in both the electron side and the hole side. The 
size of such gaps is dependent on the twist angle θ, which appears to be minimum 
(about 10 meV) at θ = 1.05° among the three rotation angels (Fig. 2a). In addition, the 
lattice reconstruction also has a great influence on band velocity in the flat bands. The 
lowest energy bands at the Dirac point in reconstructed TBGs are significantly 
flattened compared to the unrelaxed TBGs at the same angle.   
In Fig. 3, we plot the optical conductivity 
( )
 of TBGs at various rotation 
angels in a wide frequency range, when the temperature is close to 0 K. The red 
dashed line and black solid line represent the conductivity of unreconstructed and 
reconstruced TBGs, respectively. The conductivity is plotted in units of

, respectively.[40, 41] As shown in Fig. 3a-c, 
the conductivity spectrum exhibits a series of characteristic peaks, mainly including 
the first group of peaks around 0.1 eV and the second group of peaks in the frequency 
range from 0.2 eV to 0.4 eV. The peak structure almost systematically evolves with 
the rotation angle θ. When the effect of lattice relaxation is taken into account, the 
first group of peaks move to higher energies, and the peaks in the second group also 
shift significantly compared to the unreconstructed TBG system. The first peak in 
𝜎(𝜔) in reconstruced TBGs corresponds to the interband transition from the flat band 
to the higher band, which can provide an effective experimental way to determine the 
gap between the flat bands and other bands under lattice relaxation. These gaps are 
very important for understand novel transport properties of magic angle TBG. 
Therefore, experimental measurements of the optical conductivity of TBG can 
provide insights into the lattice relaxation effects in this system. 
Fig. 4 shows the band structure, DOS and the optical conductivity of relaxed 
TBG with θ = 1.05°. The black solid line (red dashed line) represents the energy 
bands of  K (
'
K ) valleys in Fig. 4a. In Fig. 4a and 4b, each characteristic saddle 
point of the band structure is corresponding to a van Hove singularity in the DOS. The 
sharp peaks in the optical conductivity spectrum (Fig. 4c) are associated with optical 
transitions involving the van Hove singularities in the DOS (Fig. 4b). For instance, aChinese Physics B 
peak numbered ① near E = 0.02 eV in Fig. 4c corresponds to the interband transition 
from the highest valence band to the second conduction band, as indicated by the 
magenta arrow in Fig. 4a. Moreover, the major peaks labeled ①-⑦ in the optical 
conductivity in Fig. 4c can be assigned to transitions between different bands labeled 
by arrows in Fig. 4a. There are also unmarked interband transitions from the other 
valence bands to the flat band in Fig. 4a, which are similar to transitions indicated by 
red arrows due to the electron-hole symmetry in the effecitive continuum model.  
Fig. 5a shows the optical conductivity of TBG with rotation angle θ = 1.05°, in 
the presence of lattice relaxation, for different values of the electronic filling. The 
lower panel (Fig. 5b) is the enlarged plot of the energy region from 0 to 0.1 eV in Fig. 
5a. The black solid line and red dashed line represent the conductivity for the Fermi 
energy level at the charge neutrality point (CNP) and full (or empty) flat bands, 
respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, at high energies, the peak energies are similar for 
different values of the electronic filling in the conductivity spectra. Remarkably, in 
Fig. 5b, the first group of peaks for full (or empty) flat bands move significantly 
towards lower energies, and at the same time, the Drude peak at zero frequency 
disappears compared to the chemical potential of the undoped system 𝜇𝐶𝑁𝑃. Next, to 
fully understand the dependence of optical conductivity on rotation angle θ, we 
additionally calculated the conductivity of relaxed TBG with rotation angle θ = 1.20° 
and 0.80° in Fig. 5c, and larger angles were described in detail in Ref. [26]. Fig. 5c 
shows that the peak energies evolve systematically with the twist angle θ, so they can 
be used as fingerprints to identify the twist angle. Especially, for the conductivity of 
TBG with θ = 0.80°, the first group of peaks degenerate into only one strong peak 
relative to that of TBGs with other larger twist angles. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have theoretically calculated the electronic band structure and optical 
conductivity spectrum of TBGs at various rotation angles in the vicinity of magic 
angle, and explored the effects of lattice relaxation. We have shown that a series of 
characteristic peaks in the conductivity spectrum is related to the van Hove 
singularities in the DOS, which enables us to extract a lot of important information 
about interband transitions and band structure. When lattice relaxation effects exist, 
the gaps between the flat bands and other bands in magic angle TBG can beChinese Physics B 
quantitatively studied according to the lowest energy peak in the conductivity 
spectrum by optical measurements. Such gaps are very important for understand the 
novel transport properties of magic angle TBG. In addition, the peaks in conductivity 
spectrum shift significantly under the effect of lattice reconstruction. Our study paves 
the way for exploring the physics of TBG employing optical techniques.Chinese Physics B
