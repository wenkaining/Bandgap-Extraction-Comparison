The role of the interface potential on the eﬀective mass of charge carriers is elucidated in this work. We develop
a new theoretical formalism using a spatially dependent eﬀective mass that is related to the magnitude
of the interface potential.
Using this formalism we studied Ge quantum dots (QDs) formed by plasma
enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and co-sputtering (sputter). These samples allowed us to
isolate important consequences arising from diﬀerences in the interface potential. We found that for a higher
interface potential, as in the case of PECVD QDs, there is a larger reduction in the eﬀective mass, which
increases the conﬁnement energy with respect to the sputter sample. We further understood the action of O
interface states by comparing our results with Ge QDs grown by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the
O states can suppress the inﬂuence of the interface potential. From our theoretical formalism we determine
the length scale over which the interface potential inﬂuences the eﬀective mass.

INTRODUCTION
Si and Ge nanostructures (NSs) remain amongst the
most important materials for photovoltaic and electronic
applications1,2. Si is extensively used in the microelec-
tronics industry partly due to the importance and stabil-
ity of its oxide3. The Ge oxide states can create compli-
cations in NSs. Fabrication of Ge NSs in a SiO2 matrix
often results in a high concentration of interface defect
states4–6, because Ge can easily occupy the Si position
within the SiO2 matrix due to its low formation energy.
Sub-oxide interface states give rise to a defect photolumi-
nescence (PL) band that can dominate quantum conﬁne-
ment (QC) eﬀects5. However, with careful control over
the fabrication7 and characterization8 conditions, Ge NSs
do clearly demonstrate QC eﬀects. Furthermore, because
of a larger Bohr radius in Ge compared to Si, Ge has the
advantage of greater tunability in the gap energy (EG)
due to QC9.
Moreover, it was recently demonstrated
that interface defect states may enhance the eﬃciency of
photovoltaic devices due to preferential hole trapping9.
The nature of its interfacial structure is arguably the
deﬁning parameter of a NS. Fundamentally, the intro-
duction of an interface modiﬁes bulk parameters5 and
introduces new phenomena. Interface states can break
valley degeneracy10.
Dangling bonds, stress, and de-
fect states elicit the degree to which the interface po-
tential conﬁnes charge carriers5. Hydrogen versus oxy-
gen termination at the interface inﬂuences the oscilla-
tor strength11 and creates polarization eﬀects at the
interface12.
Nanostructure sensing devices rely on the
a)eric.barbagiovanni@ct.infn.it
charge conﬁguration at the interface, which ‘communi-
cates’ with the environment13 and determines the con-
ductivity within the NS14. Nonetheless, the role of the in-
terface remains largely misunderstood15. The exact band
energy alignment at the interface remains a topic of in-
tense research16, as it is diﬃcult to establish the exact
chemical environment at the interface17. Defect engineer-
ing at the interface can have a complicated eﬀect on the
QC of the charge carriers18,19, which can be diﬃcult to
model theoretically20,21.
The crystal potential changes across the interface of
a NS and thus the carrier eﬀective mass (EM) changes,
which is modelled by invoking the Bastard-type bound-
ary conditions22–25.
There is experimental6,26–28 and
theoretical29,30 evidence that the EM should depend on
the NS dimension. Understanding how the EM varies in
low-dimension remains a challenge as experimental mea-
surements are model dependent31,32 and it is diﬃcult to
theoretically scale the EM to low dimensions6,33. Den-
sity functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the
EM from the density of states29. However, it is not clear
how to model the interface nor the excited states within
DFT25,34.
A common pitfall in theoretical modelling is the lack
of information regarding the interface atomic potentials,
which leads to extensive use of H-terminated surfaces at
the expense of the experimental details5. Sub-oxide inter-
faces are typically modelled using OH termination35,36.
The local density approximation is used to correct for
the local charge environment to obtain agreement with
the experimental optical gap5,35. However, there are re-
cent theoretical results using embedding matrices, such
as SiC37. Ref. 33 embedded Si NSs in a SiO2 matrix
by inserting O atoms between Si-Si bonds followed by a
randomizing procedure leading to defect and stress free2
structures. Therefore, relaxed assumptions are required
to obtain agreement with experiment and the defect land-
scape cannot be readily included38,39.
Owing to the rich variety of phenomena that the inter-
face can give rise to, understanding the contribution of
the individual components can be diﬃcult. Indeed, the-
oretical studies have suggested5,6,40 EG ∼D−x, where
1 ≤x ≤2 and D is the NS diameter, which has been
demonstrated experimentally5,41,42. In this work, we elu-
cidate the precise role of the interface potential on the
EM. An analytic formalism for the EM and interface30
was developed and applied to study Ge quantum dots
(QDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)43. The
parameters developed during our study on MBE Ge QDs
are transferred to the present study on rf-magnetron co-
sputtering (sputtering), and plasma enhanced chemical
vapour deposition (PECVD) Ge QDs. The PECVD and
sputter samples were chosen for this work because they
were fabricated under similar experimental conditions,
but exhibit a measurable variation in the chemical struc-
ture of the interface. Both sputtered and PECVD QDs
have the same dimensional dependence as the MBE QDs,
which allows us to isolate the role of the interface poten-
tial on the EM.
Comparing PECVD and sputter samples, it is found
that as the interface potential increases the EM is re-
duced thus increasing the conﬁnement energy. We deter-
mine the length scale at which the EM is modiﬁed due to
the interface potential. Furthermore, by comparing with
MBE Ge QDs we ﬁnd that O interface states can sup-
press this mechanism. These results are important for
solar cell applications, as we recently demonstrated that
defects at the interface can be engineered to enhance the
light harvesting capabilities in Ge QDs9.

EXPERIMENT
In this work, we focus our analysis on experimental
results from two fabrication methods for Ge quantum
dots (QDs) that produce diﬀerent interface potentials.
Thin ﬁlms of Ge-rich SiO2 were deposited using either
PECVD8 or sputtering9.
Thermal annealing was car-
ried out at 800 oC or 600 oC in N2 for PECVD or sput-
tered samples, respectively, to promote Ge QD nucle-
ation. In Refs. 8 and 9, the experimental details of diam-
eter control and determination are discussed along with
crystallinity measurements. Both PECVD and sputtered
QDs were determined to be in an amorphous state with
a bulk gap energy (EG(∞)) of 0.8 eV. The average diam-
eter in the sputter samples varies from 2 to 4 nm, while
in PECVD samples it varies from 3.5 to 8.4 nm. Optical
absorption measurements were performed to assess the
variation in EG with QD diameter. Ge NSs embedded
in an oxide matrix typically demonstrate a PL spectrum
dominated by a high concentration of sub-oxide related
defects at the interface between the Ge NS and the oxide
matrix, thus masking the QC related PL band5. In Refs.
8 and 9, the absorption spectrum was considered over
the PL spectrum, because defects states in the GeO2 in-
terface made it diﬃcult to measure the variation of EG
with QD diameter from the emission spectrum44, which
is more sensitive to mid-gap defects45. Finally, it is worth
noting that due to NS size distribution and carrier leak-
age there is some inherent error in associating the NS
experimental EG(D) with the correct experimental D,
see Ref. 5 for more details.
From the absorption spectra, the oscillator strength,
and EG(D) was found in Refs. 8 and 9 for each D using
the Tauc method. The applicability of the Tauc method
to NSs is discussed in detail in Ref. 9. The Tauc method
is based on a semi-empirical model for amorphous sys-
tems, which assumes parabolic band edges and optical
inter-band transitions between quasi localized states (i.e.
momentum is not conserved)46. Indeed, the method as-
sumes that the dipole-matrix element (proportional to
the oscillator strength) is not k-dependent. Breaking of
momentum (k-vector) conservation is a fundamental ten-
ant of quantum conﬁnement in NSs. Furthermore, our
NSs are amorphous and thus lack long range order. In
addition, the parabolic band edge picture can still be ap-
plied in a NS as discussed in the next section. A devia-
tion from linearity happens at low σhν due to Urbach tail
regions. For this reason, the estimation of EG for amor-
phous materials is usually performed for values of σ larger
than 2×10−9 cm2 (for our samples) where a clear lin-
ear trend in the Tauc plots appears47. Furthermore, the
EG was calculated from scanning tunnelling spectroscopy
measurements on Ge QDs to be ∼1.4 eV48. This value
agrees with our EG determined via the Tauc method for a
similar diameter range. Therefore, we ﬁnd that the Tauc
method works well for amorphous NSs and has been ex-
perimentally demonstrated in the literature27,47.
III.
THEORY
The analysis of the experimental data is carried out
using a variety of theoretical tools. The approach taken
in this work considers an interface-related correction to
the EMA. The validity of the EMA has been widely de-
bated in the literature5. Generally, it is assumed that
the parabolic band approximation breaks down at low-
dimension and thus the EMA cannot be applied. How-
ever, recently it has been shown that a notion of a ‘fuzzy-
band-structure’ holds for NSs down to ≈2 nm49, and
that the k · p method does produce the correct symme-
try of a QD50. The EMA is a ﬁrst order approximation
of the k · p generalization that considers transitions only
at the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence
band maximum (VBM). In a NS, transitions mainly oc-
cur near the Brillouin zone center (the Γ-point), due to
breaking of the momentum selection rules6. This type
of transition is referred to as pseudodirect51,52.
From
a theoretical perspective, pseudodirect behavior allows
one to ignore phonon events in the formalism.
When3
a 30-band k · p model is considered, spurious solutions
are found, which can be removed computationally53. A
two-conduction-band k·p approach has also been used54
to describe conduction band hybridization, and a two-
band approximation6 demonstrates good agreement with
experiment25. A justiﬁcation of the EMA is given in de-
tail in Refs. 5 and 6. DFT models including interface
corrections have been employed in the literature21,36, and
produce a similar dimensional dependence as the method
presented here35. However, we opt for the present ap-
proach because of the clarity in the physics at the inter-
face. Also, the DFT approaches use a diﬀerent interface
passivation from the actual experiment one.
First, we employ a new theoretical formalism using a
spatially dependent eﬀective mass (SPDEM), as detailed
in Ref.
30 and formulated in Refs.
55 and 56.
The
important feature here is the introduction of an inverse
characteristic length scale: γ2 = 2D−2, where D is the
QD diameter in nanometres. γ is not tunable, but was
derived in Ref. 30 and modiﬁes the dispersion relation
of the charge carriers as described in Sec.
V.
γ acts
as a coupling parameter between the momentum of the
charge carriers and the conﬁnement potential.
In this
formalism, the conﬁnement potential, VC, was given by:
VC,i = −Vo exp

;
(1)
where ri is the particle position in the i = x, y, z direc-
tion, and Vo is deﬁned as the energy diﬀerence between
the QD and the matrix material at the CBM or the VBM
for an electron (Vo,e) or hole (Vo,h), respectively. Using a
point canonical transformation (PCT), we demonstrated
that the SPDEM is directly related to the conﬁnement
potential. This eﬀect is analogous to the relationship be-
tween the crystal potential and the bare electron mass30.
Therefore, the SPDEM formalism is well adapted to de-
scribe the eﬀect of VC on the eﬀective mass and yields
the dispersion relation:

(2)
where m∗
o,e, and m∗
o,h are the bulk electron and hole ef-
fective mass, respectively.
The second model used in our analysis is the eﬀec-
tive mass approximation (EMA), as detailed in Ref. 6.
This model describes electron-hole conﬁnement condi-
tions within an inﬁnite conﬁnement potential context,
according to the relation:
EG(D) = EG(∞) + 7.88
D2 eV · nm2.
(3)
We note that EMA presented here is used to describe
only the eﬀect of reduced dimension on the electron
and hole and includes no additional eﬀects.
However,
we discovered a physically signiﬁcant phenomenologi-
cal correction43 to both the SPDEM and EMA models,
which was applied to obtain agreement between the two
theories, given by:

where a=0.047 nm−2, b=0.160 nm−1, and c=-0.035 are
identical for both renormalized masses, ˜µ(D) and µ(D),
and were determined in Ref. 43. The parameters ‘a’, ‘b’,
and ‘c’ were determined from PL measurements on MBE
Ge QDs43.
Ref.
57 noted that these QDs experience
strong exciton localization and thus there is no Stokes
shift between the absorption and emission spectrum. Ac-
cording to the theory of QC, localization in position space
breaks the momentum selection rules and thus phonon
coupling is not required for indirect gap materials5. In
Refs.
5 and 6 we noted that a measured Stokes shift
was a consequence of interfacial phononic modes (e.g.
vibrons).
Strong breaking of the momentum selection
rules (or time-reversibility) denoted as ‘strong conﬁne-
ment’ is included in both the EMA6 and SPDEM30 mod-
els. We showed previously6 that amorphous NSs experi-
ence strong conﬁnement in the electron and hole states.
In our model, the interface potential inﬂuences the ef-
fective mass, as noted above and discussed in Sec. V.
The parameters eSP DEM in [nm−1] and eEMA renor-
malize the bulk reduced mass, µo, and will be discussed
in Sec. IV. Therefore, we conclude that the parameters
‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ are valid for both absorption and emission
spectrum, while the inﬂuence of the interface is contained
in the parameter ‘e’.
The parameters ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ are the same for all Ge
QD samples and their physical signiﬁcance is discussed
further in Sec. V. Our aim in this work is to understand
the inﬂuence of the interface on the EM. This inﬂuence is
contained solely in the parameter ‘e’, which is introduced
as correction to the EMA and SPDEM models. This pa-
rameter gives us access to the macroscopic features of
the interface that would otherwise be inaccessible within
the standard EMA. Therefore, when we use Eqs.
(4)
and (5) with Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively, we obtain
perfect agreement in the dispersion relations43 allowing
us to isolate essential diﬀerences in the physics between
the two models, as described Sec. V. It is important to
note that we are presenting a phenomenological analysis
and not presenting these models as an alternative to pre-
viously existing theoretical models. Our intention is to
compare the results of two models across diﬀerent fabri-
cation methods to extract physically relevant information
correlated with the variation in our parameter set.
A.
Methodology
For the sputter and PECVD Ge QDs, we use Eqs. (4)
and (5) in the SPDEM-˜µ(D) and EMA-µ(D) (see Ref.
43) models to determine the relationship between the in-
terface potential and EM. For all QD samples the term4

deposited Ge-rich layer (SiGeO) formed by sputtering. The

states is shown by the respective ﬁts. Color online.

in Eqs. (4) and (5) is the same,
thus ensuring that all samples have the same dimensional
dependence as found in Ref. 43. Therefore, we are left
to determine only Vo,e, Vo,h, and the parameter e.
First, we consider Vo,e and Vo,h. From x-ray photoe-
mission spectroscopy (XPS) in sputtered Ge QDs, a Ge-
Ge signal was measured in the as-deposited ﬁlm, see Fig.
1. This signal indicated that Ge QDs formed upon initial
ﬁlm deposition. From the XPS results, no Ge-Si nor Si-Si
signal are observed indicating that all of the Ge is either
within the QD or in an oxide state, and all of the Si is
in the SiO2 state9.
Therefore, sputter thin ﬁlm depo-
sition, under our given experimental conditions, can be
modelled approximately by the random mixture model
(RMM)44,58. This model supposes that the ﬁlm is de-
scribed by the formation of a mixture of Ge, GeOx, and
GeO2 centres59. A representation of the RMM is given
in Fig. 2. In the top part of Fig. 2, we indicate a region
of Ge surrounded by layer of GeOx and a thin layer of
GeO2. Upon annealing, the Ge QD diameter and the sto-
ichiometric oxide concentration increase. This is a result
of Ge diﬀusing from the Ge-rich GeOx region into the
Ge QD region60, which is indicated in the bottom part
of Fig. 2. Simultaneously, it is possible that O diﬀuses
toward the GeO2 region. This observation implies that
the interface between the Ge QD and the matrix mate-
rial is comprised of a large concentration of GeOx states.
As a ﬁrst approximation, we consider a Ge-GeO interface
with a potential of approximately V0,e = 0.6 eV and V0,h
= 1.8 eV61.
In the case of PECVD QDs, a diﬀerent behaviour was
observed. Here the QDs are more accurately modelled
by the random bonding model (RBM), under our given
experimental conditions58, see Fig. 3. In the RBM all
of the Ge is assumed to be in one of its oxide states63.
Raman measurements (see Ref.
8) indicate that upon

ture model. The top ﬁgure depicts the as deposited Ge-rich
layer where Ge QDs are seen before annealing. Ge QDs are
surrounded by a sub-oxide shell and pure GeO2. After an-
nealing, the Ge QD diameter increases as stoichiometric GeO2
forms and the GeOx layer thickness decreases. The diﬀusion

deposition the ﬁlm is primarily in a Ge sub-oxide state,
i.e. there is no clear observation of a Ge-Ge signal, as
represented in the top part of Fig. 3. After annealing,
GeOx will phase separate into Ge QDs and GeO2 medi-
ated by Ge diﬀusion, as represented in the bottom part
of Fig.
3.
As in the case of sputter QDs, it is possi-
ble that O undergoes diﬀusion as well. This behaviour
implies that the interface is mainly composed of GeO2.
Though there must still exist a small concentration (as
compared to sputtered Ge QDs) of GeOx right at the in-
terface, which will lower the interface potential slightly
from the ideal GeO2 value. Therefore, we assume that
the interface potential is close to the value of Ge-GeO2,
which is V0,e = 1.2 eV and V0,h = 3.6 eV64.
The ﬁnal step is to determine e for both the SPDEM
and EMA models. We consider a Tauc plot of the ex-
perimental absorption cross section, σ, for PECVD and
sputtered Ge QDs from Refs. 8 and 9, respectively. σ is
modelled via the relation:
σ = B∗
hν (hν −EG(D))2 ;
(6)
where B∗is proportional to the the oscillator strength
and was determined experimentally, and hν is the pho-
ton energy. EG(D) is given by either SPDEM-˜µ(D) or
EMA-µ(D), in Eq. (6). EG(D) and D was determined
experimentally in Refs. 8 and 9, see Sec. II. In the case of5

model. The top ﬁgure depicts the as deposited Ge-rich layer
comprised of sub-stoichiometric GeO2, GeOx, where x <1.5.
After annealing, phase separation occurs and Ge QDs form
surrounded by GeO2, with a small concentration of GeOx
right at the interface. The diﬀusion process is indicated by the
arrows in the middle part of the ﬁgure. Molecular structures
were generated using VESTA62 and represent only a cross
section of the QD structure. Color online.
EMA-µ(D), we ﬁt Eq. (6) via eEMA to the experimental
data for each QD D and EG(D). For SPDEM-˜µ(D), as
we noted above, the interface potential was approximated
from our discussion of the RMM, or RBM for the sput-
ter, or PECVD samples, respectively. Since these models
are only a ﬁrst approximation we allowed Vo,e and Vo,h
to vary within 25% of their proposed values, and then we
ﬁtted Eq. (6) to the data by varying eSP DEM and Vo,e(h)
for each experimental QD D and EG(D).
IV.
RESULTS
The results obtained from ﬁtting SPDEM-˜µ(D) to the
sputtered and PECVD samples are shown in Figs. 4 and
5, respectively. The deviation from linearity in the ex-
perimental data at low σhν is due to Urbach tail regions,
i.e. defect states near the band edge, which are common
to amorphous structures as in this work9. In PECVD
samples (Fig. 5) there is a deviation from linearity at
high σhν due to a partial crystalline transition in less
than 30% of the QDs after annealing at 800 oC8. When
the ﬁt was constrained to the linear region, a less than
1 % diﬀerence was found in our ﬁnal ﬁtting parameters
compared to ﬁtting over the entire data set. The ﬁtted
value for eSP DEM is listed for each QD D in Figs. 4 and

found to be notably identical (within 1%) for each QD

SPDEM-˜µ(D) and EMA-µ(D) models agree with each
other. The parameters a, b, and c in Eqs. (4) and (5)
were found by analysing MBE grown Ge QDs43. There is
good agreement between the experimental data and our
calculation, noting that the error bars in the D of the
PECVD samples are on the order of 2 nm8.
The EG for the PECVD grown samples is higher than
the sputter samples. The reason for the diﬀerence is un-
derstood within our models.
From the SPDEM-˜µ(D)
model, we ﬁnd a larger interface potential in PECVD
samples compared to the sputter samples.
The larger
interface potential is correlated with a larger reduction
in eEMA, which increases the conﬁnement energy. MBE
Ge QDs were fabricated with an a-Si matrix, which has
a lower interface potential than both PECVD and sput-
ter Ge QDs, see Fig.
6.
However, the EG is compa-
rable to the other two samples with a value of eEMA
in between the PECVD and sputter values. It is diﬃ-
cult to make a full comparison between the sputter and
PECVD samples versus the MBE samples, because the
MBE samples were fabricated under very diﬀerent con-
ditions. However, we can consider a few essential diﬀer-
ences. In the case of the MBE QDs there are no O-defect
states43,65, because of the unique fabrication method. O-
defect states at the interface increase the spread of the
wave-function, thus lowering the conﬁnement energy12.
Furthermore, O interface states can pin the charge carri-
ers, again lowering the conﬁnement energy5,6. The com-
bination of these phenomena lowers the conﬁnement en-
ergy in PECVD and sputter samples, in agreement with
theoretical predictions12, and it becomes comparable to
that in MBE samples (see Fig. 6). Therefore, we under-
stand that the O interface states are the source of the
diﬀerence between the sputter and PECVD samples ver-
sus the MBE samples.
Nonetheless, we see that for a
higher interface energy a larger reduction in the EM is
obtained.
V.
DISCUSSION
A closer examination of the results shown in Table I
in the context of our models allows us to understand the
nature of the conﬁnement mechanism. As mentioned in
Sec. III, the SPDEM theory models a modiﬁcation in the
EM due to the interface potential. In Ref. 30, we derive
the envelope function within the SPDEM formalism:

where σ ∼(Vo)−1/2 is the Gaussian strength. In Fig.
7, we plot the probability amplitude of Eq.
(7) for a
6 nm QD as a function of the interface potential and
particle position.
As the interface potential increases,
the probability amplitude is increasingly localized, which
implies increasing de-localization in momentum space. A
Fourier transformation of Eq. (7) demonstrated that the
SPDEM envelope function exhibits an increased spread
in momentum space compared to a Gaussian envelope
function30.
The interface potential alters the SPDEM
envelope function because of the introduction of γ, which
modiﬁed the EM through the relation30:
m(ri) =
m∗
o
(1 + γiri)2 .
(8)
Therefore, from (eSP DEM)−1 we can ﬁnd the length
scale at which the EM begins to change, which is 16.95,
11.11, and 5.53 nm in MBE, PECVD, and sputter sam-
ples, respectively. At the stated dimensions the SPDEM7

energy begins to deviate from the experimental data and
eSP DEM corrects for this behaviour. In Fig. 8 we plot
˜µ(D)/µo and µ(D)/µo from Eqs. (4) and (5), respec-
tively, where the role of eSP DEM can be seen. Below di-
ameters of around 16 and 11 nm the MBE and PECVD
˜µ(D)/µo curves are less than 1 indicating that ˜µ(D) in-
creases EG(D) below these dimensions. The diﬀerence
between the cross-over dimension depicted in Fig. 8 and
the value obtained from (eSP DEM)−1 is because of exper-
imental error. We note that in Fig. 8 the ˜µ(D)/µo curve
for the sputter sample does not fall below 1. In Ref. 43,
we determined that above 6.2 nm the dispersion relation
is dominated by the SPDEM-˜µ(D) relation. Therefore,
the sputter (eSP DEM)−1 value of 5.53 nm indicates that
the SPDEM mechanism is suppressed in these samples.
The diﬀerent behaviour found for the sputter samples
is a consequence of their interface quality (Secs. III A
and IV). The lower interface potential does not create a
strong conﬁnement condition for the charge carriers, see
Fig. 7. Additionally, the sub-oxide interface states pro-
mote de-localization of the wave-function in real space12.
The values obtained for (eSDP EM)−1 also agree with
the results of Fig. 6. First, we note that the value ob-
tained for the MBE samples of ∼16 nm is on the order
of the Bohr radius for Ge. This result is what we expect
in these samples, because of the high quality interface.
At 16 nm, the charge carriers in the MBE samples begin
to experience the inﬂuence of the conﬁnement potential
and thus their energy is modiﬁed, as predicted by QC.
While in the PECVD and sputter samples, the onset of
QC is suppressed from the expected Bohr radius value.
Therefore, the PECVD and sputter samples experience
the eﬀects of QC over a smaller diameter range compared
to MBE, and thus their EG shift is not as great.
The relationship between pure QC eﬀects and a modi-
ﬁed EM are understood by comparing the SPDEM-˜µ(D)

results with respect to the EMA-µ(D) results. In a pre-
vious work on Ge QDs buried in a-Si43 we found that
above ≈6.2 nm the EG ∼D−1, due to a modiﬁcation
in the EM, while below ≈4.6 nm the EG ∼D−2, due
to pure QC eﬀects.
These parameters come from the

in Eqs. (4) and (5), and
represent a universal dimensional dependence. The pa-
rameter e represents a correction to these ideal length
scales due to additional eﬀects not included in the the-
ory, which in our analysis include the O-interface states.
If we consider the ratio eEMA/eSP DEM, then we obtain
3.05 and 2.81 nm for sputter and PECVD samples, re-
spectively. This length scale signiﬁes when the conﬁne-
ment behaviour changes from the SPDEM to the EMA
model and is depicted in Fig. 8 by the vertical line at 2.9
nm. Within experimental error, we thus ﬁnd that pure
QC eﬀects dominate at ≈2.9 nm, which is suppressed
from the ideal case (between 6.2 and 4.6 nm) due to the
interface states. On the other hand, the same ratio in
MBE samples gives 6.4 nm (see vertical line in Fig. 8),
which is in agreement with the ideal value (6.2 nm), be-
cause there are no O interface states in this sample. Fi-
nally, this is in agreement with previous results obtained
in Ref. 43, where the MBE value of 6 nm was found to
be the dimension that produces the most eﬃcient lumi-
nescence. From our work here we understand this result
on the basis that this is the dimension at which the be-
haviour changes from SPDEM to EMA and thus carriers
are strongly conﬁned.
We illustrate collectively all of the phenomena de-
scribed in this manuscript in Fig.
9.
At the top of
the ﬁgure we recall the dimensional dependence of the
SPDEM-˜µ(D) and EMA-µ(D) models. Fig 9 is divided
into two parts. In the ‘pink’ region of the ﬁgure above ∼68
nm, the dominant model is SPDEM-˜µ(D), which models
a change in EG in conjunction with a change in the EM.
The ‘grey’ region below ∼4 nm is modelled according
to the EMA-µ(D) where pure QC eﬀects dominate. The
‘pink’ and ‘grey’ regions were determined from the results
of Ref. 43 and come from the universal dimensional pa-
rameters a, and b in the term

.
From the parameter (eSP DEM)−1, we determined the
onset of the SPDEM behaviour at ∼16, 11, and 5 nm
in the MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respectively.
The change in energy due to SPDEM is represented by
the solid curved line in Fig. 9 for the three samples (not
drawn to scale). The MBE sample’s value is in agree-
ment with the Bohr radius for Ge and indicates when
the charge carriers ﬁrst ‘feel’ the conﬁnement potential.
In the case of PECVD and sputter samples this value is
suppressed due to the O states at the interface, which
cause the wave-function to leak into the matrix and thus
lowers the conﬁnement energy, as described above. The
PECVD case has a higher value than the sputter case due
to the higher conﬁnement potential and thus experience
a larger change in EG, due to an increased reduction in
the EM.
The transition point from SPDEM to EMA is on the
order of 5 nm according to the transition from the ‘pink’
to the ‘grey’ region in Fig. 9. From the ratio of eEMA
to eSP DEM we determined this transition for each sam-
ple. The change in energy due to EMA is represented by
the dashed curved line in Fig. 9 for the three samples
(not drawn to scale). In the case of MBE sample, the
transition is in agreement with the calculated value at 6
nm, because of the lack of O at the interface. While in
PECVD and sputter samples they both change behaviour
at around 3 nm. The suppression here again is due to O
interface states, as described above.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Using a previously developed theoretical formalism as
an analytical tool we have been able to understand the
relationship between the EM and the interface potential.
We found that when the interface potential was large
there exists a strong reduction in the EM. This condition
was clearly demonstrated when comparing PECVD and
sputter samples, where the PECVD case has a larger
interface potential. However, if the sample contains O
states at the interface, then the conﬁnement energy was
reduced due to these states. This result was noted by
comparing MBE samples with no O interface states to
the PECVD and sputter samples. We determined the
length scale where the samples begin to experience a
modiﬁcation in EG due to a change in the EM, which
was ∼16, 11, and 5 nm for MBE, PECVD, and sput-
ter samples, respectively. The lower values in PECVD
and sputter samples compared to MBE samples were un-
derstood in terms of the O interface states. We found
the length scale where the QC mechanism changes from
SPDEM to EMA, which was 6, and 3 nm in MBE and
PECVD/sputter samples, respectively. All of these re-
sults are summarised graphically in Fig. 9. These re-
sults indicate an additional carrier conﬁnement mecha-
nism in NSs, which can be exploited for device fabrica-
tion through interface engineering. From this work, we
have found a dynamic relationship between the magni-
tude of the interface potential and the EM with respect
to the chemical composition of the interface.

FIG. 9. Schematic illustration of the conﬁnement mechanism. The dimensional behaviour of the SPDEM-˜µ(D) and EMA-µ(D)
is noted at the top of the ﬁgure. In the ‘pink’ region above ∼6 nm the dominate model is SPDEM, while in the ‘grey’ region
below ∼4 nm EMA is the dominant model, see Ref. 43. The bulk EG is represented by the straight dashed line. At ∼16 ,
11, and 5 nm the MBE, PECVD, and sputter samples, respectively, experience a change in the EM and hence EG, according
to the SPDEM model. The change in energy due to SPDEM is represented by the solid curved line in the three regions for
the respective samples (not drawn to scale). At ∼6, and 3 nm the MBE, and PECVD/ sputter samples, respectively, change
behaviour from SPDEM to EMA. The change in energy due to EMA is represented by the dashed curved line in the two
regions for the respective samples (not drawn to scale). The lower dimensions in PECVD and sputter samples compared to
the predicted pink and grey regions is a result of the O interface. Color online.
