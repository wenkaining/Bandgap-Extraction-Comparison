Abstract
We parametrize the Stillinger-Weber potential for 156 two-dimensional atomic crystals. Parame-
ters for the Stillinger-Weber potential are obtained from the valence force ﬁeld model following the
analytic approach (Nanotechnology 26, 315706 (2015)), in which the valence force constants are
determined by the phonon spectrum. The Stillinger-Weber potential is an eﬃcient nonlinear inter-
action, and is applicable for numerical simulations of nonlinear physical or mechanical processes.
The supplemental resources for all simulations in the present work are available online in Ref. 1,
including a fortran code to generate crystals’ structures, ﬁles for molecular dynamics simulations
using LAMMPS, ﬁles for phonon calculations with the Stillinger-Weber potential using GULP, and
ﬁles for phonon calculations with the valence force ﬁeld model using GULP.

INTRODUCTION
The atomic interaction is of essential importance in the numerical investigation of most
physical or mechanical processes. The present work provides parameters for the Stillinger-
Weber (SW) empirical potential for 156 two-dimensional atomic crystal (TDACs). In prac-
tical applications, these layered materials are usually played as lego on atomic scale to
construct the van der Waals heterostructures with comprehensive properties.2 The compu-
tational cost of ab initio for the heterostructure will be substantially increased as compared
with one individual atomic layer, because the unit cell for the heterostructure is typically
very large resulting from the mismatch of the lattice constants of diﬀerent layered compo-
nents. The empirical potential will be a competitive alternative to help out this diﬃcult
situation, considering their high eﬃciency.
In the early stage before 1980s, the computation ability of the scientiﬁc community was
quite limited. At that time, the valence force ﬁeld (VFF) model was one popular empirical
potential for the description of the atomic interaction, since the VFF model is linear and
can be applied in the analytic derivation of most elastic quantities.3 In this model, each VFF
term corresponds to a particular motion style in the crystal. Hence, each parameter in the
VFF model usually has clear physical essence, which is beneﬁcial for the parameterization
of this model. For instance, the bond stretching term in the VFF model is directly related
to the frequency of the longitudinal optical phonon modes, so the force constant of the bond
stretching term can be determined from the frequencies of the longitudinal optical phonon
modes. The VFF model can thus serve as the starting point for developing atomic empirical
potentials for diﬀerent crystals.
While the VFF model is beneﬁcial for the fastest numerical simulation, its strong lim-
itation is the absence of nonlinear eﬀect. Due to this limitation, the VFF model is not
applicable to nonlinear phenomena, for which other potential models with nonlinear compo-
nents are required. Some representative potential models are (in the order of their simulation
costs) SW potential,4 Tersoﬀpotential,5 Brenner potential,6 ab initio approaches, and etc.
The SW potential is one of the simplest potential forms with nonlinear eﬀects included. An
advanced feature for the SW potential is that it includes the nonlinear eﬀect, and keeps the
numerical simulation at a very fast level.
Considering its distinct advantages, the present article aims at providing the SW potential
2for 156 TDACs. We will determine parameters for the SW potential from the VFF model,
following the analytic approach proposed by one of the present author (J.W.J).7 The VFF
constants are ﬁtted to the phonon spectrum or the elastic properties in the TDACs.
In this paper, we parametrize the SW potential for 156 TDACs. All structures discussed

VFF MODEL AND SW POTENTIAL
A.
VFF model
The VFF model is one of the most widely used linear model for the description of atomic
interactions.3 The bond stretching and the angle bending are two typical motion styles for
most covalent bonding materials. The bond stretching describes the energy variation for
a bond due to a bond variation ∆r = r −r0, with r0 as the initial bond length.
The
angle bending gives the energy increment for an angle resulting from an angle variation
∆θ = θ −θ0, with θ0 as the initial angle. In the VFF model, the energy variations for the
bond stretching and the angle bending are described by the following quadratic forms,
Vr = 1
2Kr (∆r)2 ,
(1)
Vθ = 1
2Kθ (∆θ)2 ,
(2)
where Kr and Kθ are two force constant parameters. These two potential expressions in
Eqs. (1) and (2) are directly related to the optical phonon modes in the crystal. Hence,
their force constant parameters Kr and Kθ are usually determined by ﬁtting to the phonon
dispersion.
B.
SW potential
In the SW potential, energy increments for the bond stretching and angle bending are
described by the following two-body and three-body forms,
V2 (rij) = A (B/rij −1) e[ρ/(rij−rmax)],
(3)
V3 (θijk) = Ke[ρ1/(rij−rmax12)+ρ2/(rik−rmax13)]
(cos θijk −cosθ0)2
(4)
where V2 corresponds to the bond stretching and V3 associates with the angle bending. The
cut-oﬀs rmax, rmax12 and rmax13 are geometrically determined by the material’s structure.
There are ﬁve unknown geometrical parameters, i.e., ρ and B in the two-body V2 term and
ρ1, ρ2, and θ0 in the three-body V3 term, and two energy parameters A and K. There is a
5constraint among these parameters due to the equilibrium condition,7
ρ = −4B (d −rmax)2
(Bd −d5)
,
(5)
where d is the equilibrium bond length from experiments. Eq. (5) ensures that the bond has
an equilibrium length of d and the V2 interaction for this bond is at the energy minimum
state at the equilibrium conﬁguration.
The energy parameters A and K in the SW potential can be analytically derived from
the VFF model as follows,
A =
Kr
αe[ρ/(d−rmax)],
(6)
K =
Kθ
2 sin2 θ0e[ρ1/(d1−rmax12)+ρ2/(d2−rmax13)],

(9)
V3 (θijk) = ǫλe[γσ/(rij−aσ)+γσ/(rjk−aσ)]

(10)
The parameters here can be determined by comparing the SW potential forms in Eqs. (9)
and (10) with Eqs. (3) and (4). It is obvious that p = 4 and q = 0. Eqs. (9) and (10) have
two more parameters than Eqs. (3) and (4), so we can set ǫ = 1.0 eV and γ = 1.0. The
other parameters in Eqs. (9) and (10) are related to these parameters in Eqs. (3) and (4) by
the following equations
AL = A,

The SW potential is implemented in GULP using Eqs. (3) and (4). The SW potential is
implemented in LAMMPS using Eqs. (9) and (10).
In the rest of this article, we will develop the VFF model and the SW potential for
layered crystals. The VFF model will be developed by ﬁtting to the phonon dispersion from
experiments or ﬁrst-principles calculations. The SW potential will be developed following the
above analytic parameterization approach. In this work, GULP8 is used for the calculation of
phonon dispersion and the ﬁtting process, while LAMMPS9 is used for molecular dynamics
simulations.
The OVITO10 and XCRYSDEN11 packages are used for visualization.

simulation scripts for GULP and LAMMPS are available online in Ref. 1.

Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-ScO2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1H-ScO2.

The structure for the single-layer 1H-ScO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Sc and X=O). Each
Sc atom is surrounded by six O atoms. These O atoms are categorized into the top group
(eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each O atom is connected
to three Sc atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 3.16 ˚A, and the bond length dSc−O = 2.09 ˚A. The resultant
angles are θScOO = θOScSc = 98.222◦and θScOO′ = 58.398◦, in which atoms O and O’ are
from diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.

Table X shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-ScO2, one of which is the bond
stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to
the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along ΓM as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The ab
initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Fig. 3 (b) shows that the VFF
model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential
is derived from the VFF model.

We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer
1H-ScO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Sc in Fig. 1 (with M=Sc and
X=O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate
these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be ac-
complished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is
not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS
package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom
types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Sc and X=O)

shows that, for 1H-ScO2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Sc atom by assigning
these six neighboring O atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom
types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Sc atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-ScO2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 4 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-ScO2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-ScO2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
ScO2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 126.3 N/m and 125.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially

and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.16.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-ScO2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -652.8 N/m and -683.3 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 12.2 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.19 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 11.7 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

to three Sc atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 3.70 ˚A, and the bond length dSc−S = 2.52 ˚A. The resultant

diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.
Table XIV shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-ScS2, one of which is the bond
stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to
the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The ab
initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Fig. 5 (b) shows that the VFF
model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential
is derived from the VFF model.

We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer
1H-ScS2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Sc in Fig. 1 (with M=Sc and
X=S) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate
these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be ac-
complished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is
not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS
package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom
types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Sc and X=S)
shows that, for 1H-ScS2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Sc atom by assigning
these six neighboring S atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom
types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Sc atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-ScS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 6 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-ScS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-ScS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
ScS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 43.8 N/m and 43.2 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.30.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-ScS2. We have

thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1

at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 5.9 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.32 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. There is only one
(longitudinal) acoustic branch available. We ﬁnd that the VFF parameters can be chosen
to be the same as that of the 1H-ScSe2, from which the longitudinal acoustic branch agrees
with the ab initio results as shown in Fig. 9 (a). It has also been shown that the VFF

that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the

is connected to three Ti atoms. The structural parameters are from Ref. 12, including the
lattice constant a = 3.62 ˚A, and the bond length dTi−Te = 2.75 ˚A. The resultant angles
are θTiTeTe = θTeTiTi = 82.323◦and θTiTeTe′ = 81.071◦, in which atoms Te and Te’ are from

26LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Ti in Fig. 1 (with M=Ti and X=Te) are not
distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate these angles
by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by
modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is not so conve-
nient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so
it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Ti and X=Te) shows
that, for 1H-TiTe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Ti atom by assigning these
six neighboring Te atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types
are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Ti atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-TiTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 12 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-TiTe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-TiTe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
TiTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 47.9 N/m and 47.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.29.
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-TiTe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -158.6 N/m and -176.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 6.6 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 6.3 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-VO2 are based on the ﬁrst-

1H-VO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-VO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=V and X=O). Each
V atom is surrounded by six O atoms. These O atoms are categorized into the top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each O atom is connected
to three V atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 2.70 ˚A, and the bond length dV−O = 1.92 ˚A. The resultant

Table XXX shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-VO2, one of which is the bond
stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to
the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 13 (a). The
ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Fig. 13 (b) shows that
the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW
potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. XXXI.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. XXXII.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in
Tab. XXXIII. We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of
the single-layer 1H-VO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom V in Fig. 1 (with
M=V and X=O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to
diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which
can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experi-

along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 81.7 N/m and 80.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.23.
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-VSe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s

along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.5 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 9.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

FIG. 24: (Color online) Stress-strain for single-layer 1H-CrS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A along the
armchair and zigzag directions.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-CrS2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Cr and X=S).
Each Cr atom is surrounded by six S atoms. These S atoms are categorized into the top
group (eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each S atom
is connected to three Cr atoms. The structural parameters are from Ref. 17, including the
lattice constant a = 2.99 ˚A, and the bond length dCr−S = 2.254 ˚A. The resultant angles are
θCrSS = θSCrCr = 83.099◦and θCrSS′ = 80.031◦, in which atoms S and S’ are from diﬀerent
(top or bottom) group.
Table L shows four VFF terms for the 1H-CrS2, one of which is the bond stretching
interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction
shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three
acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 23 (a). The ab
initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 17. Similar phonon dispersion can
also be found in other ab initio calculations.12 Fig. 23 (b) shows that the VFF model and
the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived
from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. LI.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. LII.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. LIII. We note that
twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-CrS2 using
LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Cr in Fig. 1 (with M=Cr and X=S) are not
49distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate these angles
by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by
modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is not so conve-
nient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so
it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Cr and X=S) shows
that, for 1H-CrS2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Cr atom by assigning these
six neighboring S atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types
are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Cr atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-CrS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 24 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-CrS2 of dimension 100 ×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-CrS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
CrS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 98.4 N/m and 97.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are in reasonably agreement
with the ab initio results, eg. 112.0 N/m from Refs 18, or 111.9 N/m from Ref. 19. The
Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.26, which agrees
with the ab initio value of 0.27.18,19
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-CrS2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by
ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s mod-
ulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -364.8 N/m and -409.3 N/m along
the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 12.4 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.22 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 11.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-

curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-CrSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary

along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are in reasonably agreement

with the ab initio value of 0.30.18,19
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-CrSe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the
value of B in most two-dimensional atomic layered materials. The value of the third order
nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ =
Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential
are -279.6 N/m and -318.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The
ultimate stress is about 13.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at
the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 12.4 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain
of 0.29 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

57modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is not so conve-
nient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so
it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Cr and X=Te) shows
that, for 1H-CrTe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Cr atom by assigning these
six neighboring Te atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types
are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Cr atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-CrTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 28 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-CrTe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-CrTe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
CrTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 77.2 N/m and 76.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are in reasonably agreement
with the ab initio results, eg. 63.9 N/m from Refs 18 and 19. The Poisson’s ratio from the
VFF model and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.30, which agrees with the ab initio value
of 0.30.18,19
There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-CrTe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the
value of B in most two-dimensional atomic layered materials. The value of the third order
nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ =
Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential
are -237.1 N/m and -280.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The
ultimate stress is about 11.2 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at
the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 10.7 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain
of 0.29 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

1H-MNO2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-MnO2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1H-MnO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-MnO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Mn and X=O).
Each Mn atom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
O atom is connected to three Mn atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 2.61 ˚A, and the bond length

Table LXII shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-MnO2, one of which is the bond

the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 29 (a). The
ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Typically, the transverse
acoustic branch has a linear dispersion, so is higher than the ﬂexural branch. However, it can

(eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each S atom is connected
to three Fe atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 3.06 ˚A, and the bond length dFe−S = 2.22 ˚A. The resultant
angles are θFeSS = θSFeFe = 87.132◦and θFeSS′ = 74.537◦, in which atoms S and S’ are from
diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.

The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Fig. 33 (b) shows that
the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW

Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in
Tab. LXXIII. We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of
the single-layer 1H-FeS2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Fe in Fig. 1 (with
M=Fe and X=S) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to
diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which
can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experi-
ence, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the
LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing
more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Fe
and X=S) shows that, for 1H-FeS2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Fe atom
by assigning these six neighboring S atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that
twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around
one Fe atom.
69We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-FeS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 34 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-FeS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-FeS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
FeS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 83.6 N/m and 83.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.20.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-FeS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -377.5 N/m and -412.7 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.0 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.20 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 8.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-FeSe2 are based on the ﬁrst-

1H-FeSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-FeSe2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Fe and X=Se).
Each Fe atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.

Each
Se atom is connected to three Fe atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 3.22 ˚A, and the bond length
dFe−Se = 2.35 ˚A. The resultant angles are θFeSeSe = θSeFeFe = 86.488◦and θFeSeSe′ = 75.424◦,

Table LXXXII shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-CoTe2, one of which is the

ﬁtting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 39 (a).

are listed in Tab. LXXXV. We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the
simulation of the single-layer 1H-CoTe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom
Co in Fig. 1 (with M=Co and X=Te) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have sug-
gested two options to diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints
in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14
According to our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these con-
straints and recompile the LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate
the angles by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS
package. Fig. 2 (with M=Co and X=Te) shows that, for 1H-CoTe2, we can diﬀerentiate
these angles around the Co atom by assigning these six neighboring Te atoms with diﬀer-
ent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of
diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Co atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-CoTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 40 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-CoTe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-CoTe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
CoTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 53.7 N/m and 54.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.32.

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-CoTe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -157.2 N/m and -187.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 8.2 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 7.9 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.33 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

The structure for the single-layer 1H-NiS2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Ni and X=S). Each

to three Ni atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 3.40 ˚A, and the bond length dNi−S = 2.24 ˚A. The resultant
angles are θNiSS = θSNiNi = 98.740◦and θNiSS′ = 57.593◦, in which atoms S and S’ are from

The structure for the single-layer 1H-NiSe2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Ni and X=Se).
Each Ni atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.

Each
Se atom is connected to three Ni atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-

dNi−Se = 2.35 ˚A. The resultant angles are θNiSeSe = θSeNiNi = 90.228◦and θNiSeSe′ = 70.206◦,
in which atoms Se and Se’ are from diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.
Table XC shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-NiSe2, one of which is the bond
stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting
to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 43 (a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. The lowest acoustic
branch (ﬂexural mode) is almost linear in the ab initio calculations, which may due to the
violation of the rigid rotational invariance.20 Fig. 43 (b) shows that the VFF model and the
SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from
the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. XCI. The
parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. XCII. Some
representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. XCIII.
We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer
881H-NiSe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Ni in Fig. 1 (with M=Ni and

diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which
can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experi-
ence, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the
LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing
more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Ni
and X=Te) shows that, for 1H-NiTe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Ni atom
by assigning these six neighboring Te atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that
twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around
one Ni atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-NiTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 46 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-NiTe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-NiTe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
NiTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 53.2 N/m and 53.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.32.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-NiTe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -156.6 N/m and -184.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 8.1 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 7.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.33 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

Each Nb atom is surrounded by six S atoms. These S atoms are categorized into the top

induces weak eﬀects on the two inplane acoustic branches. The inter-layer coupling will
strengthen the out-of-plane acoustic branch (ﬂexural branch), so the ﬂexural branch from

We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the
value of B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be
extracted by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as
the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -258.8 N/m
and -306.1 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress
is about 11.2 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low

1H-MOO2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1H-MoO2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1H-MoO2.
The structure for the single-layer 1H-MoO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Mo and X=O).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six O atoms.
These O atoms are categorized into the

atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
O atom is connected to three Mo atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 2.78 ˚A, and the bond length
dMo−O = 2.00 ˚A. The resultant angles are θMoOO = θOMoMo = 88.054◦and θMoOO′ = 73.258◦,
in which atoms O and O’ are from diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.
Table CVI shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-MoO2, one of which is the bond
stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to
the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 51 (a). The
ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 12. Fig. 51 (b) shows that
the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW
potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CVII.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CVIII.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in
Tab. CIX. We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of
the single-layer 1H-MoO2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Fig. 1
(with M=Mo and X=O) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two op-
tions to diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS,
which can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our
104experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and re-
compile the LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by
introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2
(with M=Mo and X=O) shows that, for 1H-MoO2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around
the Mo atom by assigning these six neighboring O atoms with diﬀerent atom types.
It
can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six
neighbors around one Mo atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-MoO2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 52 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-MoO2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-MoO2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
MoO2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 210.0 N/m and 209.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.17.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-MoO2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -1027.8 N/m and -1106.8 N/m along
the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 21.0 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.19 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 20.1 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.22 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

spectrum of the bulk 2H-MoS2.22 In 2009, Liang et al. parameterized a bond-order potential
for 1H-MoS2,23 which is based on the bond order concept underlying the Brenner potential.6
A separate force ﬁeld model was parameterized in 2010 for MD simulations of bulk 2H-
MoS2.24 The present author (J.W.J.) and his collaborators parameterized the SW potential
for 1H-MoS2 in 2013,13 which was improved by one of the present author (J.W.J.) in 2015.7
Recently, another set of parameters for the SW potential were proposed for the single-layer
1071H-MoS2.25
We show the VFF model and the SW potential for single-layer 1H-MoS2 in this section.
These potentials have been developed in previous works. The VFF model presented here is
from Ref. 22, while the SW potential presented in this section is from Ref. 7.
The structural parameters for the single-layer 1H-MoS2 are from the ﬁrst-principles cal-
culations as shown in Fig. 1 (with M=Mo and X=S).26 The Mo atom layer in the single-layer
1H-MoS2 is sandwiched by two S atom layers. Accordingly, each Mo atom is surrounded
by six S atoms, while each S atom is connected to three Mo atoms. The bond length be-
tween neighboring Mo and S atoms is d = 2.382 ˚A, and the angles are θMoSS = 80.581◦and
θSMoMo = 80.581◦.
The VFF model for single-layer 1H-MoS2 is from Ref. 22, which is able to describe the
phonon spectrum and the sound velocity accurately. We have listed the ﬁrst three leading
force constants for single-layer 1H-MoS2 in Tab. CX, neglecting other weak interaction terms.
The SW potential parameters for single-layer 1H-MoS2 used by GULP are listed in Tabs. CXI
and CXII. The SW potential parameters for single-layer 1H-MoS2 used by LAMMPS9 are
listed in Tab. CXIII. We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation
of the single-layer 1H-MoS2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Fig. 1
(with M=Mo and X=S) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options
to diﬀerentiate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS,
which can be accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to
our experience, it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and
recompile the LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles
by introducing more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package.
Fig. 2 (with M=Mo and X=S) shows that, for 1H-MoS2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles
around the Mo atom by assigning these six neighboring S atoms with diﬀerent atom types.
It can be found that twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all
six neighbors around one Mo atom.
We use GULP to compute the phonon dispersion for the single-layer 1H-MoS2 as shown
in Fig. 53. The results from the VFF model are quite comparable with the experiment
data. The phonon dispersion from the SW potential is the same as that from the VFF
model, which indicates that the SW potential has fully inherited the linear portion of the
interaction from the VFF model.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-MoS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 54 shows the stress-strain
curve during the tension of a single-layer 1H-MoS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic
boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-
MoS2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated
without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-
layer 1H-MoS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain
relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 97 N/m and 96 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is isotropic in
the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are in considerable agreement with the
experimental results, eg. 120±30 N/m from Refs 27,28, or 180±60 N/m from Ref. 29. The
third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation
to σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are -418 N/m and
-461 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from
the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.27.

Table CXIV shows four VFF terms for the 1H-MoSe2, one of which is the bond stretching
interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending interaction
shown by Eq. (2). These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three
acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 55 (a). The ab
initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 30. Similar phonon dispersion
can also be found in other ab initio calculations.12,31–34 Fig. 55 (b) shows that the VFF
model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential
is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CXV.

The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CXVI.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. CXVII. We note that
twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-MoSe2
using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Fig. 1 (with M=Mo and X=Se) are

that, for 1H-MoSe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Mo atom by assigning these
six neighboring Se atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types
are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Mo atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-MoSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 56 shows the stress-strain
curve during the tension of a single-layer 1H-MoSe2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic
boundary conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer
1H-MoSe2 is stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction.
The stress is
calculated without involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure
of the single-layer 1H-MoSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting
of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus
are 103.0 N/m and 101.8 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The

Young’s modulus is essentially isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values
are in considerable agreement with the experimental results, eg. 103.9 N/m from Refs 18,
or 113.9 N/m from Ref. 35. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential
is νxy = νyx = 0.24, which agrees quite well with the ab initio value of 0.23.18
We have determined the nonlinear parameter to be B = 0.46d4 in Eq. (5) by ﬁtting to the
third-order nonlinear elastic constant D from the ab initio calculations.35 We have extracted
the value of D = −383.7 N/m by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation along the armchair direction
in the ab initio calculations to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -365.4 N/m and -402.4 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 13.6 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 13.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

Table CXVIII shows four VFF terms for the 1H-MoTe2, one of which is the bond stretch-

initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 36. Similar phonon dispersion can
also be found in other ab initio calculations.12,34,37 Fig. 57 (b) shows that the VFF model and
the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived
from the VFF model.

twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-MoTe2
using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Mo in Fig. 1 (with M=Mo and X=Te) are
not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate these angles
by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by
modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is not so conve-
nient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so

branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 59 (a). The theoretical
phonon frequencies (gray pentagons) are from Ref. 21, which are the phonon dispersion
of bulk 2H-TaS2. We have used these phonon frequencies as the phonon dispersion of the
single-layer 1H-TaS2, as the inter-layer interaction in the bulk 2H-TaS2 only induces weak
eﬀects on the two inplane acoustic branches. The inter-layer coupling will strengthen the
out-of-plane acoustic (ﬂexural) branch, so the ﬂexural branch from the present VFF model
(blue line) is lower than the theoretical results for bulk 2H-TaS2 (gray pentagons). Fig. 59 (b)
shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion,
as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-TaS2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by
ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s mod-
ulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -313.0 N/m and -349.3 N/m along
the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 11.4 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 10.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

phonon frequencies (gray pentagons) are from Ref. 21, which are the phonon dispersion of
bulk 2H-TaSe2. We have used these phonon frequencies as the phonon dispersion of the
single-layer 1H-TaSe2, as the inter-layer interaction in the bulk 2H-TaSe2 only induces weak
eﬀects on the two in-plane acoustic branches. The inter-layer coupling will strengthen the
out-of-plane acoustic branch (ﬂexural branch), so the ﬂexural branch from the present VFF
model (blue line) is lower than the theoretical results for bulk 2H-TaSe2 (gray pentagons).
Fig. 61 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CXXVII.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CXXVIII.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. CXXIX. We note that

twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer 1H-TaSe2 using
LAMMPS, because the angles around atom Ta in Fig. 1 (with M=Ta and X=Se) are not
distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerentiate these angles
by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be accomplished by
modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience, it is not so conve-
nient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the LAMMPS package.
Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing more atom types, so
it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=Ta and X=Se) shows
that, for 1H-TaSe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the Ta atom by assigning these
six neighboring Se atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that twelve atom types
are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around one Ta atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-TaSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 62 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-TaSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-TaSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
TaSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 80.8 N/m and 81.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.29.

There is no available value for the nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1H-TaSe2.
We have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the
value of B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be
extracted by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as
the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -263.3 N/m
and -308.6 N/m along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress
is about 11.3 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low
temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 10.7 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.28
in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

to three W atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 2.80 ˚A, and the bond length dW−O = 2.03 ˚A. The resultant
angles are θWOO = θOWW = 87.206◦and θWOO′ = 74.435◦, in which atoms O and O’ are
from diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.
Table CXXX shows four VFF terms for the single-layer 1H-WO2, one of which is the bond

the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 121.5 N/m along both armchair
and zigzag directions. These values are in reasonably agreement with the ab initio results,
eg. 139.6 N/m from Ref. 18, or 148.5 N/m from Ref. 35. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF
model and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.21, which agrees with the ab initio value of
0.22.18
We have determined the nonlinear parameter to be B = 0.47d4 in Eq. (5) by ﬁtting to the
third-order nonlinear elastic constant D from the ab initio calculations.35 We have extracted
the value of D = −502.9 N/m by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation along the armchair direction
in the ab initio calculations to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -472.8 N/m and -529.6 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 14.7 Nm−1 at the

group (eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each Se atom
is connected to three W atoms. The structural parameters are from Ref. 12, including the
lattice constant a = 3.25 ˚A, and the bond length dW−Se = 2.51 ˚A. The resultant angles
are θWSeSe = θSeWW = 80.693◦and θWSeSe′ = 83.240◦, in which atoms Se and Se’ are from
diﬀerent (top or bottom) group.

135We note that twelve atom types have been introduced for the simulation of the single-layer
1H-WSe2 using LAMMPS, because the angles around atom W in Fig. 1 (with M=W and
X=Se) are not distinguishable in LAMMPS. We have suggested two options to diﬀerenti-
ate these angles by implementing some additional constraints in LAMMPS, which can be
accomplished by modifying the source ﬁle of LAMMPS.13,14 According to our experience,
it is not so convenient for some users to implement these constraints and recompile the
LAMMPS package. Hence, in the present work, we diﬀerentiate the angles by introducing
more atom types, so it is not necessary to modify the LAMMPS package. Fig. 2 (with M=W
and X=Se) shows that, for 1H-WSe2, we can diﬀerentiate these angles around the W atom
by assigning these six neighboring Se atoms with diﬀerent atom types. It can be found that
twelve atom types are necessary for the purpose of diﬀerentiating all six neighbors around
one W atom.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1H-WSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 68 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1H-WSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1H-WSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1H-
WSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 124.1 N/m and 123.0 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are in reasonably agreement
with the ab initio results, eg. 116.0 N/m from Ref. 18, or 126.2 N/m from Ref. 35. The
Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.20, which agrees
with the ab initio value of 0.19.18
We have determined the nonlinear parameter to be B = 0.41d4 in Eq. (5) by ﬁtting to the
third-order nonlinear elastic constant D from the ab initio calculations.35 We have extracted
the value of D = −413.1 N/m by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation along the armchair direction
in the ab initio calculations to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -400.4 N/m and -444.3 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 17.8 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate

isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ScO2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1

The values of D from the present SW potential are -422.4 N/m and -453.7 N/m along the

ultimate strain of 0.22 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate

1T-SCS2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-ScS2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-ScS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-ScS2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Sc and X=S).
Each Sc atom is surrounded by six S atoms. These S atoms are categorized into the top group
(eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each S atom is connected
to three Sc atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,12
including the lattice constant a = 3.62 ˚A, and the bond length dSc−S = 2.50 ˚A. The resultant

stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KSc−S−S is for the angle

are from Ref. 12. Fig. 74 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CLI. The
parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CLII. Some
representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. CLIII.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-ScS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 75 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-ScS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-ScS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
ScS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 30.0 N/m and 29.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.17.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ScS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -113.7 N/m and -124.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 3.8 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 3.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

dSc−Se = 2.64 ˚A. The resultant angle is θSeScSc = 83.621◦and θScSeSe = 83.621◦with Se
atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.

are from Ref. 12. We note that the lowest-frequency branch aroung the Γ point from the
VFF model is lower than the ab initio results. This branch is the ﬂexural branch, which
should be a quadratic dispersion. However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion
for the ﬂexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the ﬁrst-
principles package,20 so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this

stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
TiS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 75.0 N/m and 74.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.20. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 85 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-TiS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -220.8 N/m and -264.4 N/m along the

1T-TISE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-TiSe2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-TiSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-TiSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Ti and X=Se).
Each Ti atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each Se
atom is connected to three Ti atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles
calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 3.43 ˚A and the bond length dTi−Se = 2.51 ˚A.
The resultant angles are θTiSeSe = 86.199◦with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom)
group, and θSeTiTi = 86.199◦.
Table CLXVI shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-TiSe2, one of which is the
bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle bending

The resultant angles are θVSeSe = 83.201◦with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom)
group, and θSeVV = 83.201◦.
Table CLXXVIII shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-VSe2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KV−Se−Se is for
the angle θV−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. These force
constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 88 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 12. The lowest acoustic branch (ﬂexural mode) is almost linear in
the ab initio calculations, which may due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance.20
Fig. 88 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-VSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 89 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-VSe2 of dimension 100 ×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-VSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
VSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 78.4 N/m and 78.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.22.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-VSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -168.5 N/m and -218.6 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 13.1 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.27 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 12.5 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.32 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

VTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 61.2 N/m and 61.0 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.24. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 67 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-VTe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -95.8 N/m and -135.6 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 11.5 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.30 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 11.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.34 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-MnS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 95 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-MnS2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-MnS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
MnS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 47.1 N/m and 46.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-MnS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -193.8 N/m and -210.1 N/m

The structure for the single-layer 1T-MnSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Mn and X=Se).
Each Mn atom is surrounded by six Se atoms. These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
Se atom is connected to three Mn atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 3.27 ˚A and the bond length
dMn−Se = 2.39 ˚A. The resultant angles are θMnSeSe = 86.330◦with Se atoms from the same
(top or bottom) group, and θSeMnMn = 86.330◦.
Table CXCIV shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-MnSe2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-MnSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 97 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-MnSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-MnSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
MnSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 43.2 N/m and 42.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.17.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-MnSe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of

and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.13. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 59 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-CoTe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -221.5 N/m and -238.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 5.6 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 5.4 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-

curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-NiO2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-NiO2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
NiO2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation

along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.12.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-NiO2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -748.7 N/m and -796.0 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 17.4 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.20 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 16.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the zigzag direction at the low

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 42.6 N/m and 42.4 N/m

and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.14.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-NiTe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B

by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -187.6 N/m and -200.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 4.7 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 4.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

The structure for the single-layer 1T-ZrS2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Zr and X=S).
Each Zr atom is surrounded by six S atoms. These S atoms are categorized into the top group
(eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each S atom is connected
to three Zr atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles calculations,49
including the lattice constant a = 3.690 ˚A and the bond length dZr−S = 2.58 ˚A. The
resultant angles are θZrSS = 91.305◦with S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group, and

Table CCXXII shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-ZrS2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KZr−S−S is for
the angle θZr−S−S with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. These force
constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 110 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 38. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio
calculations.34 Fig. 110 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCXXIII. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown
in Tab. CCXXIV. Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS
are listed in Tab. CCXXV.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-ZrS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 111 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-ZrS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-ZrS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
ZrS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 71.8 N/m and 71.5 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are close to the ab initio results
at 0 K temperature, eg. 75.74 Nm−1 in Ref. 49. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.16, which are comparable with the ab initio result49
of 0.22.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ZrS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -268.9 N/m and -305.2 N/m

FIG. 113: (Color online) Stress-strain for single-layer 1T-ZrSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A along the
armchair and zigzag directions.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-ZrSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Zr and X=Se).
Each Zr atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each Se
atom is connected to three Zr atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles
calculations,51 including the lattice constant a = 3.707 ˚A, and the position of the Se atom
with respective to the Zr atomic plane h = 1.591 ˚A. The resultant angles are θZrSeSe = 88.058◦
with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group, and θSeZrZr = 88.058◦.
Table CCXXVI shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-ZrSe2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KZr−Se−Se is for
the angle θZr−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. These force
constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 112 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 50. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio
calculations.34 Fig. 112 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCXXVII. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown
in Tab. CCXXVIII. Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS
are listed in Tab. CCXXIX.
212We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-ZrSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 113 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-ZrSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-ZrSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
ZrSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 66.7 N/m and 66.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.19.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ZrSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -219.6 N/m and -256.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.0 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 8.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.28 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

1T-ZRTE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-ZrTe2 are based on the ﬁrst-

1T-ZrTe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-ZrTe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Zr and X=Te).
Each Zr atom is surrounded by six Te atoms. These Te atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
Te atom is connected to three Zr atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,48 including the lattice constant a = 4.0064 ˚A, and the bond length
dZr−Te = 2.9021 ˚A, which is derived from the angle θTeZrZr = 87.3◦. The other angle is

that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 44 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-

and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.10. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 44 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ZrTe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -187.2 N/m and -201.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 4.0 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.19 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 3.9 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.22 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.
Fig. 115 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-NbS2 are based on the ﬁrst-

1T-NbS2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-NbS2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Nb and X=S).
Each Nb atom is surrounded by six S atoms. These S atoms are categorized into the top
group (eg. atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg. atoms 2, 4, and 6). Each S atom
is connected to three Nb atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-principles
calculations,12 including the lattice constant a = 3.30 ˚A and the bond length dNb−S = 2.45 ˚A.

The resultant angles are θNbSS = 84.671◦with S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group,
and θSNbNb = 84.671◦.
Table CCXXXIV shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-NbS2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KNb−S−S is for
the angle θNb−S−S with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. These force
constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 116 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 12. The lowest acoustic branch (ﬂexural mode) is linear and very
close to the inplane transverse acoustic branch in the ab initio calculations, which may due to
the violation of the rigid rotational invariance.20 Fig. 116 (b) shows that the VFF model and
the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived
from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCXXXV. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown

stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
NbS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 73.8 N/m and 73.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.18.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-NbS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -250.5 N/m and -290.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.7 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 9.4 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 67.1 N/m and 66.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.20. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 73 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically lead to about
10% underestimation for the Young’s modulus value.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-NbSe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1

at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 9.3 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.29 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-

-0.07.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-MoS2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCXLVII. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-MoS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 122 shows the stress-strain

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 88.7 N/m and 88.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially

and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = −0.07. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about
10% smaller than the ab initio result of 103 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are

leads to about 10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-MoS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -595.2 N/m and -624.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 6.5 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.14 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 6.5 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.16 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

1T-MOSE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-MoSe2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-MoSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-MoSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Mo and X=Se).
Each Mo atom is surrounded by six Se atoms. These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).

Se atom is connected to three Mo atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,48 including the lattice constant a = 3.2685 ˚A, and the bond length
dMo−Se = 2.5293 ˚A, which is derived from the angle θSeMoMo = 80.5◦. The other angle is
θMoSeSe = 80.5◦with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table CCL shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-MoSe2, one of which is the
bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KMo−Se−Se is for the
angle θMo−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd that
there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value
by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system.
The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 104 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as
-0.13.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-MoSe2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
232parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CCLI.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. CCLII.
Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in
Tab. CCLIII.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-MoSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 124 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-MoSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-MoSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
MoSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 88.2 N/m and 87.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = −0.13. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about
10% smaller than the ab initio result of 104 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are
considered in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically
leads to about 10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-MoSe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -632.6 N/m and -629.7 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 6.1 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.13 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 6.2 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.15 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.
Fig. 125 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

layer 1T-TcSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 130 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-TcSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-TcSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
TcSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 88.8 N/m and 88.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = −0.04. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about
10% smaller than the ab initio result of 104 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are
considered in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically
leads to about 10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-TcSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -565.7 N/m and -587.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 6.8 Nm−1

1T-TCTE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-TcTe2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-TcTe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-TcTe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Tc and X=Te).
Each Tc atom is surrounded by six Te atoms. These Te atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
Te atom is connected to three Tc atoms. The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,48 including the lattice constant a = 3.4149 ˚A, and the bond length
dTc−Te = 2.6900 ˚A, which is derived from the angle θTeTcTc = 78.8◦. The other angle is
θTcTeTe = 78.8◦with Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table CCLXVI shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-TcTe2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle

bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KTc−Te−Te is
for the angle θTc−Te−Te with both Te atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd
that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 34 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as
-0.36.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-TcTe2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCLXVII. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown
in Tab. CCLXVIII. Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS
are listed in Tab. CCLXIX.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-TcTe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 132 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-TcTe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-TcTe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
246involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
TcTe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 28.6 N/m along the armchair
and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is
νxy = νyx = −0.21. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10% smaller than the ab
initio result of 34 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered in the present work.
The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about 10% underestimation
for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-TcTe2. We
have thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of
B in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -207.8 N/m and -208.7 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 1.9 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.11 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 2.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.14 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate strain decreases to be about 0.01 at 300 K, so the
single-layer 1T-TcTe2 is not very stable at higher temperature. It is because this material
is very soft and the Poisson’s ratio is very small (negative value).
Fig. 133 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 69.9 N/m and 69.5 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially

Table CCLXXVIII shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-PdSe2, one of which

for the angle θPd−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd
that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 66 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-PdSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 138 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-PdSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-PdSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
PdSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 65.5 N/m and 65.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-PdSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -194.7 N/m and -222.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.9 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 9.5 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.31 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.
Fig. 139 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
SnSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 82.0 N/m and 81.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-SnSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -339.2 N/m and -368.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.5 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 9.1 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.25 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

Table CCXCIV shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-HfS2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KHf−S−S is for
the angle θHf−S−S with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. These force
constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 146 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 38. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio
calculations.34,54 Fig. 146 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-HfS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 147 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-HfS2 of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-HfS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
HfS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 73.3 N/m and 72.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. These values are close to the ab initio results
at 0 K temperature, eg. 79.86 Nm−1 in Ref. 53. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.16, which agrees reasonably with the ab initio result53
of 0.19.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-HfS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1

with respective to the Hf atomic plane h = 1.575 ˚A. The resultant angles are θHfSeSe = 88.093◦

Table CCXCVIII shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-HfSe2, one of which is

Table CCCVI shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-TaS2, one of which is the

θTa−S−S with both S atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd that there are
actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their value by ﬁtting
to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio calculations
have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 101 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as 0.20.48

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-TaS2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 152 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-TaS2 of dimension 100 ×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-TaS2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
TaS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 87.8 N/m and 87.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.20. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 101 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-TaS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -276.3 N/m and -313.0 N/m along the

-0.03.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-WS2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52

in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -666.6 N/m and -660.6 N/m

1T-WSE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-WSe2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-WSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-WSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=W and X=Se).
Each W atom is surrounded by six Se atoms.
These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
Se atom is connected to three W atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,48 including the lattice constant a = 3.2574 ˚A, and the bond length
dW−Se = 2.5207 ˚A, which is derived from the angle θSeWW = 80.5◦. The other angle is
θWSeSe = 80.5◦with Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group.
Table CCCXXII shows three VFF terms for the single-layer 1T-WSe2, one of which is
the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle

for the angle θW−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd
that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 94 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as
-0.15.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-WSe2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCCXXIII. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown
in Tab. CCCXXIV. Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS
are listed in Tab. CCCXXV.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-WSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 160 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-WSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-WSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
293involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
WSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 80.5 N/m and 80.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = −0.15. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about 10%
smaller than the ab initio result of 94 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered
in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically leads to about
10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-WSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -666.1 N/m and -580.1 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 5.5 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.13 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 5.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.15 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.
Fig. 161 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

is the bond stretching interaction shown by Eq. (1) while the other two terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). We note that the angle bending term KRe−Se−Se is
for the angle θRe−Se−Se with both Se atoms from the same (top or bottom) group. We ﬁnd
that there are actually only two parameters in the VFF model, so we can determine their
value by ﬁtting to the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the system. The ab initio
calculations have predicted the Young’s modulus to be 123 N/m and the Poisson’s ratio as
-0.03.48 The ab initio calculations have predicted a negative Poisson’s ratio in the 1T-ReSe2,
which was attributed to the orbital coupling in this material. The orbital coupling enhances
the angle bending interaction in the VFF model. As a result, the value of the angle bending
parameter is much larger than the bond stretching force constant parameter, which is typical
in auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.52
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCCXXXV. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are
shown in Tab. CCCXXXVI. Some representative parameters for the SW potential used by
303LAMMPS are listed in Tab. CCCXXXVII.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer 1T-ReSe2 under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 166 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer 1T-ReSe2 of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer 1T-ReSe2 is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer 1T-
ReSe2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 108.2 N/m and 107.7 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = −0.03. The ﬁtted Young’s modulus value is about
10% smaller than the ab initio result of 123 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are
considered in the present work. The long-range interactions are ignored, which typically
leads to about 10% underestimation for the value of the Young’s modulus.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-ReSe2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -669.3 N/m and -699.9 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 8.5 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.14 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 8.4 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.17 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.
Fig. 167 shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 59.4 N/m and 59.3 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model

smaller than the ab initio result of 71 N/m,48 as only short-range interactions are considered

PtS2. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 105.9 N/m and 105.4 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.16.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer 1T-PtS2. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in
most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -420.6 N/m and -457.1 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 12.8 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.22 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 12.3 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.26 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

1T-PTSE2
Most existing theoretical studies on the single-layer 1T-PtSe2 are based on the ﬁrst-
principles calculations. In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the single-layer
1T-PtSe2.
The structure for the single-layer 1T-PtSe2 is shown in Fig. 71 (with M=Pt and X=Se).
Each Pt atom is surrounded by six Se atoms. These Se atoms are categorized into the
top group (eg.
atoms 1, 3, and 5) and bottom group (eg.
atoms 2, 4, and 6).
Each
Se atom is connected to three Pt atoms.
The structural parameters are from the ﬁrst-
principles calculations,48 including the lattice constant a = 3.6662 ˚A, and the bond length

mechanical properties from this SW potential are smaller than ﬁrst-principles calculations,
as some angle-angle crossing VFF terms can not be implemented in the SW potential. We

as these two bonds have very close bond length value. The force constant parameters are
the same for the two angle bending terms θ123 and θ134, which have very similar chemical
environment. These force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic
branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Fig. 179 (a). The ab initio
calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 55. Similar phonon dispersion can also
be found in other ab initio calculations.58–64 Fig. 179 (b) shows that the VFF model and the

Fig. 180 shows the stress strain relations for the black phosphorus of size 100 × 100 ˚A.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The Young’s modulus is 24.3 Nm−1 and 90.5 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions
respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,
0.01]. These values agree quite well with previously reported ab initio results, eg. 28.9 Nm−1
and 101.6 Nm−1 from Ref. 65, or 24.4 Nm−1 and 92.1 Nm−1 from Ref. 66, or 24.3 Nm−1 and
80.2 Nm−1 from Ref. 58. The ultimate stress is about 4.27 Nm−1 at the critical strain of
0.33 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about
8.0 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.19 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.
These values agree quite well with the ab initio results at 0 K.66
It should be noted that the Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential
are νxy = 0.058 and νyx = 0.22. These values are obviously smaller than ﬁrst-principles
calculations results, eg. 0.4 and 0.93 from Ref. 67, or 0.17 and 0.62 from Ref. 58, or 0.24
and 0.81 from Ref. 59. The Poisson’s ratio can not be obtained correctly by the VFF model
proposed in 198256 and the SW potential7 either.68 These failures are due to the missing of
one angle-angle crossing term,69 which has not been implemented in the package LAMMPS
and is not included in the present work.

P-ARSENENE
Present studies on the puckered (p-) arsenene, also named α arsenene, are based on ﬁrst-
principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-arsenene. We
will thus parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer p-arsenene in this section. We
will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the single-layer p-arsenene.
The structure of the single-layer p-arsenene is exactly the same as that of the black
phosphorus as shown in Fig. 178. Structural parameters for p-arsenene are from the ab
initio calculations.70 The pucker of the p-arsenene is perpendicular to the x (armchair)-

of the dimensionless parameter u is extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in
Ref. 70. The other dimensionless parameter v is a ratio based on the lattice constant in
the out-of-plane z-direction, so the other basis a3 = 11.11 ˚A from Ref. 71 is also adopted
in extracting the value of v. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u and v in
representing atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures.
The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. 70.

have very close bond length value. The force constant parameters happen to be the same for
the two angle bending terms θ123 and θ134. These force constant parameters are determined
by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in
Fig. 181 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from Ref. 70. Similar
phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations.64,72–74 We note that
the lowest-frequency branch aroung the Γ point from the VFF model is lower than the ab
initio results. This branch is the ﬂexural branch, which should be a quadratic dispersion.

However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion for the ﬂexural branch due to
the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the ﬁrst-principles package,20 so ab initio
calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this branch. Fig. 181 (b) shows that
the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW
potential is derived from the VFF model.

Fig. 182 shows the stress strain relations for the p-arsenene of size 100 × 100 ˚A. The
structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The Young’s modulus is 20.7 Nm−1 and 73.0 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions
respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,
0.01]. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the stress-
strain relation to σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are
-56.4 N/m and -415.5 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 3.5 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.31 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 6.5 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.18 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

P-ANTIMONENE
Present studies on the puckered (p-) antimonene, also named α antimonene, are based
on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-
antimonene. We will thus parametrize a set of VFF model for the single-layer p-antimonene
in this section.
We will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the
single-layer p-antimonene.
The structure of the single-layer p-antimonene is shown in Fig. 183, which is similar as

are (−u, 0, −v), (u, 0, v), (0.5 −u, 0.5, v + w), and (0.5 + u, 0.5, −v + w) with u = 0.044,
v = 0.128 and w = 0.0338. The value of the dimensionless parameter u is extracted from

with diﬀerent z-coordinates. Speciﬁcally, in Fig. 183 (c), there is a diﬀerence of wa3 between
the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of atoms 2 and 3. Similarly, atom 4 is
higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction. As a result of the nonzero value of
w, there are two diﬀerent inter-group angles, i.e., θ134 = 88.3◦and θ415 = 102.8◦. We have
w = 0 for the ideal puckered conﬁguration of the black phosphorus.

two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths. As a result, there
are only three force constant parameters, i.e., K12 = K14, K123, and K134 = K415. These

respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,

νyx = 0.29. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the
stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are
-22.1 N/m and -354.1 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 3.7 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.37 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 6.4 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.17 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

338higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction. As a result of the nonzero value
of w, there are two diﬀerent inter-group angles, i.e., θ134 = 86.486◦and θ415 = 103.491◦. We
have w = 0 for the ideal puckered conﬁguration of the black phosphorus.
Table CCCLXX shows ﬁve VFF terms for the single-layer p-bismuthene, two of which are
the bond stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). The force constant parameters are reasonably chosen
to be the same for the two bond stretching terms denoted by r12 and r14, as these two bonds
have very close bond length value. The force constant parameters are the same for the two
angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths. As a result, there are
only three force constant parameters, i.e., K12 = K14, K123, and K134 = K415. These three
force constant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the
phonon dispersion along the ΓX as shown in Fig. 187 (a). The ab initio calculations for the
phonon dispersion are from Ref. 77. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other
ab initio calculations.64 Fig. 187 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give
exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CCCLXXI. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are
shown in Tab. CCCLXXII. Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed
in Tab. CCCLXXIII. Eight atom types have been introduced for writing the SW potential
script used by LAMMPS as shown in Fig. 184, which helps to increase the cutoﬀfor the
bond stretching interaction between atoms like 1 and 2 in Fig. 183 (c).
Fig. 188 shows the stress strain relations for the p-bismuthene of size 100 × 100 ˚A. The
structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The Young’s modulus is 10.2 Nm−1 and 26.2 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions
respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,
0.01]. The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy = 0.24 and
νyx = 0.61. These values are very close to the ab initio calculations, eg. νxy = 0.261 and
νyx = 0.648 in Ref. 77. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by
ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The
values of D are -12.4 N/m and -86.4 N/m at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions,
respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.6 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.38 in the
armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 3.9 Nm−1 at

P-SIO
Present studies on the puckered (p-) SiO are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and
no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-SiO. We will thus parametrize the SW
potential for the single-layer p-SiO in this section.
340FIG. 190: (Color online) Eight atom types are introduced for atoms in the p-MX, with M from
group IV and X from group VI. (a) Top view. (b) Side view.
The structure of the single-layer p-SiO is shown in Fig. 189, with M=Si and X=O.
Structural parameters for p-SiO are from the ab initio calculations.78 There are four atoms
in the unit cell with relative coordinates as (−u, 0, −v), (u, 0, v), (0.5 −u, 0.5, v + w), and
(0.5 + u, 0.5, −v + w) with u = 0.1501, v = 0.0605 and w = 0.0800. The value of these
dimensionless parameters are extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in Ref. 78,
including lattice constants a1 = 4.701 ˚A and a2 = 2.739 ˚A, bond lengths d12 = 1.843 ˚A and
d14 = 2.859 ˚A, and the angle θ145 = 96.0◦. The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios
based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which is arbitrarily chosen as
a3 = 10.0 ˚A. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing
atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present
work. The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. 78.
As shown in Fig. 189, a speciﬁc feature in the puckered conﬁguration of the p-SiO is that
there is a small diﬀerence of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of
atoms 2 and 3. Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
341FIG. 191: (Color online) Zigzag conﬁguration of single-layer p-MX, with M from group IV and
X=O. Atom M (O) is represented by purple larger (red smaller) balls.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the out-most positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5,
and 6 are the out-most atoms if w > 0 in Fig. 189 (c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the
out-most positions for w < 0. The p-SiO has a zigzag conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 191,
which is a speciﬁc case of the puckered structure shown in Fig. 189.
Table CCCLXXIV shows ﬁve VFF terms for the single-layer p-SiO, two of which are the
bond stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle
bending interaction shown by Eq. (2). The force constant parameters are the same for the
two angle bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths. All force constant
parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion
along the ΓX as shown in Fig. 192 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion
are calculated from the SIESTA package.79 The generalized gradients approximation is ap-
plied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
parameterization,80 and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted. Fig. 192 (b) shows that

is almost zero in the armchair direction. The Young’s modulus is 81.3 Nm−1 in the zigzag

atoms 2 and 3. Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the out-most positions, e.g., atoms 1, 5,
and 6 are the out-most atoms if w > 0 in Fig. 189 (c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take the
out-most positions for w < 0. The p-SnO has a zigzag conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 191,
which is a speciﬁc case of the puckered structure shown in Fig. 189.

Fig. 197 shows the stress strain relations for the single-layer p-SnO of size 100 × 100 ˚A.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The structure of p-SnO is so soft along the armchair direction that the Young’s modulus
is almost zero in the armchair direction. The Young’s modulus is 52.8 Nm−1 in the zigzag
direction at 1 K, which is obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0, 0.01].
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the stress-strain
relation to σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The value of D is -204.5 Nm−1
at 1 K along the zigzag direction. The ultimate stress is about 3.8 Nm−1 at the critical
strain of 0.38 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is
about 6.8 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.26 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature
of 1 K.

P-CS
Present studies on the puckered (p-) CS are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and
no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-CS. We will thus parametrize the SW
potential for the single-layer p-CS in this section.
The structure of the single-layer p-CS is shown in Fig. 189, with M=C and X=S. Struc-
tural parameters for p-CS are from the ab initio calculations.78 There are four atoms in
the unit cell with relative coordinates as (−u, 0, −v), (u, 0, v), (0.5 −u, 0.5, v + w), and

atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present
work. The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. 78.

0.01]. The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy = 0.04 and
νyx = 0.12. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the
stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are
-24.1 Nm−1 and -145.2 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.39 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 4.2 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.25 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

The structure of the single-layer p-GeS is shown in Fig. 189, with M=Ge and X=S.
Structural parameters for p-GeS are from the ab initio calculations.78 There are four atoms

Table CDVI shows ﬁve VFF terms for the single-layer p-SiSe, two of which are the bond
stretching interactions shown by Eq. (1) while the other three terms are the angle bending
interaction shown by Eq. (2). The force constant parameters are the same for the two angle
bending terms θ134 and θ415, which have the same arm lengths. All force constant parameters
are determined by ﬁtting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the ΓX as
shown in Fig. 208 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are calculated
from the SIESTA package.79 The generalized gradients approximation is applied to account
for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parameterization,80

The Young’s modulus is 14.4 Nm−1 and 44.6 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions

Fig. 213 shows the stress strain relations for the single-layer p-SnSe of size 100 × 100 ˚A.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The Young’s modulus is 11.4 Nm−1 and 34.1 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions
respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,
0.01]. The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy = 0.11 and
νyx = 0.33. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the
stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are
-22.0 Nm−1 and -128.8 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.32 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 3.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.15 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

P-CTE
Present studies on the puckered (p-) CTe are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and
no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-CTe. We will thus parametrize the SW
potential for the single-layer p-CTe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer p-CTe is shown in Fig. 189, with M=C and X=Te.
Structural parameters for p-CTe are from the ab initio calculations.78 There are four atoms
in the unit cell with relative coordinates as (−u, 0, −v), (u, 0, v), (0.5 −u, 0.5, v + w), and

including lattice constants a1 = 3.889 ˚A and a2 = 3.390 ˚A, bond lengths d12 = 2.164 ˚A and

based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which is arbitrarily chosen as
a3 = 10.0 ˚A. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing
atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present
work. The resultant atomic coordinates are the same as that in Ref. 78.

no empirical potential has been proposed for the p-GeTe. We will thus parametrize the SW
potential for the single-layer p-GeTe in this section.

(a) The VFF model
is ﬁtted to the acoustic branches in the long wave limit along the ΓX direction. The ab initio
calculations are calculated from SIESTA. (b) The VFF model (blue lines) and the SW potential
(red lines) give the same phonon dispersion for the p-GeTe along ΓXSYΓ.
The structure of the single-layer p-GeTe is shown in Fig. 189, with M=Ge and X=Te.
Structural parameters for p-GeTe are from the ab initio calculations.78 There are four atoms
in the unit cell with relative coordinates as (−u, 0, −v), (u, 0, v), (0.5 −u, 0.5, v + w), and
(0.5 + u, 0.5, −v + w) with u = 0.0538, v = 0.1422 and w = −0.0216. The value of these
dimensionless parameters are extracted from the geometrical parameters provided in Ref. 78,
including lattice constants a1 = 4.376 ˚A and a2 = 4.238 ˚A, bond lengths d12 = 2.736 ˚A and
d14 = 2.883 ˚A, and the angle θ145 = 100.4◦. The dimensionless parameters v and w are ratios
based on the lattice constant in the out-of-plane z-direction, which is arbitrarily chosen as
a3 = 10.0 ˚A. We note that the main purpose of the usage of u, v, and w in representing
atomic coordinates is to follow the same convention for all puckered structures in the present

As shown in Fig. 189, a speciﬁc feature in the puckered conﬁguration of the p-GeTe is that
there is a small diﬀerence of wa3 between the z-coordinate of atom 1 and the z-coordinates of
atoms 2 and 3. Similarly, atom 4 is higher than atoms 5 and 6 for wa3 along the z-direction.
The sign of w determines which types of atoms take the out-most positions, e.g., atoms 1,
5, and 6 are the out-most atoms if w > 0 in Fig. 189 (c), while atoms 2, 3, and 4 will take
the out-most positions for w < 0.

cutoﬀfor the bond stretching interaction between atom 1 and atom 2 in Fig. 189 (c).
Fig. 219 shows the stress strain relations for the single-layer p-GeTe of size 100 × 100 ˚A.
The structure is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K.
The Young’s modulus is 8.1 Nm−1 and 41.6 Nm−1 in the armchair and zigzag directions
respectively at 1 K, which are obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0,
0.01]. The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are νxy = 0.09 and
νyx = 0.49. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the
stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are
-10.5 Nm−1 and -143.7 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.6 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.53 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 5.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.21 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

-7.2 Nm−1 and -114.5 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 2.4 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.61 in the armchair direction
at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 5.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.21 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

the planar silicene, so two sets of optimized parameters for the SW potential were proposed
to simulate the thermal conductivity in the single-layer silicene in 2014.90 We will develop a
new SW potential to describe the interaction within the silicene in this section, with speciﬁc
focus on the mechanical properties of the silicene.
The structure of the silicene is shown in Fig. 222, with structural parameters from the
400FIG. 224: (Color online) Stress-strain relations for the silicene of size 100 × 100 ˚A. The silicene is
uniaxially stretched along the armchair or zigzag directions at temperatures 1 K and 300 K. Left
inset shows the buckled conﬁguration for the silicene at the uniaxial strain 0.07 at 1 K along the
armchair direction. Right inset: the buckled conﬁguration becomes planar for the silicene at the
uniaxial strain of 0.08 at 1 K along the armchair direction.
ab initio calculations.84 The silicene has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 222 (b),
where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. The height of the buckle is h = 0.45 ˚A and
the lattice constant is 3.87 ˚A, which results in a bond length of 2.279 ˚A.
Table CDXXXIV shows the VFF model for the silicene. The force constant parameters
are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along the
ΓM as shown in Fig. 223 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are from
Ref. 84. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio calculations.84,91–102
Fig. 223 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon
dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
We note that the present SW potential is ﬁtted perfectly to the three acoustic phonon
branches, so it can give a nice description for the elastic deformation of the silicene. As a
trade oﬀ, the optical phonons are overestimated by the present SW potential. Hence, the
present SW potential is in particular suitable for the simulation of mechanical or thermal
processes which are dominated by acoustic phonons, while the present SW potential may
cause a systematic error for the optical absorption process which mainly involves the optical
phonons. One can introduce the long-range interactions (eg. the second-nearest-neighboring
interaction) to give a good description for both acoustic and optical phonon branches, see
401one such example for borophene in Ref. 14. It is because the long-range interaction mainly
contributes to the acoustic phonon branches, while it makes only neglectable contribution
to the optical phonon branches. As another solution, the SW potential can give reasonable
descriptions for the optical phonon branches by reducing its accuracy in describing acoustic
phonon branches as done in Ref. 90.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in
Tab. CDXXXV. The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are
shown in Tab. CDXXXVI. Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in
Tab. CDXXXVII.
Fig. 224 shows the stress strain relations for the silicene of size 100×100 ˚A. The structure
is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K and 300 K. The Young’s
modulus is 63.3 Nm−1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by
linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is isotropic for
the silicene. The value of the Young’s modulus agrees with the value of 63.8 Nm−1 from the
ab initio calculations.103 The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are
νxy = νyx = 0.15, which are smaller but comparable with the ab initio results of 0.325.103
The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting the stress-strain
relation to σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus. The values of D are -212.5 Nm−1
and -267.5 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate
stress is about 8.6 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.23 in the armchair direction at the low
temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 7.8 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.23 in
the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.
The stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 224 disclose a structural transition at the strain
around 0.076 for the silicene at the low temperature of 1 K. The buckled conﬁguration of the
silicene is ﬂattened during this structural transition, which can be seen from these two insets
in Fig. 224. This structural transition was also observed in the ab initio calculations,95 where
the critical strain for the structural transition is 0.2. At temperatures above 300 K, this
structural transition is blurred by stronger thermal vibrations; i.e., the buckled conﬁguration
of the silicene can be strongly disturbed by the thermal vibration at higher temperatures.

GERMANENE
In a recent work, the Tersoﬀpotential was applied to simulate the thermal conductivity of
the germanene nanoribbon.104 We will provide the SW potential to describe the interaction
within the germanene in this section.
The structure of the germanene is shown in Fig. 222, with structural parameters from the
ab initio calculations.84 The germanene has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 222 (b),
where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. The height of the buckle is h = 0.69 ˚A and
the lattice constant is 4.06 ˚A, which results in a bond length of 2.443 ˚A.

obtained by linear ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is

of D are -229.2 Nm−1 and -278.2 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions,
respectively.
The ultimate stress is about 7.5 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.26 in the
armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 7.3 Nm−1 at
the critical strain of 0.27 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.

Ref. 105 with the spin-orbit coupling eﬀect. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in
other ab initio calculations.101,102,105,109–111 Fig. 227 (b) shows that the VFF model and the

at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate stress is about 3.6 Nm−1 at the critical strain
of 0.29 in the zigzag direction at the low temperature of 1 K.
The stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 228 disclose a structural transition for the stanene
at the low temperature of 1 K. The critical strain for the structural transition is about
0.15 along the armchair and zigzag directions. The buckled conﬁguration of the stanene
is ﬂattened during this structural transition, which can be seen from these two insets in

INDIENE
In this section, we will develop the SW potential for the indiene, i.e., the single layer of
Indium atoms. The structure of the indiene is shown in Fig. 222, with structural parameters

should be a quadratic dispersion. However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion
for the ﬂexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the ﬁrst-
principles package,20 so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this
branch. Fig. 229 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same
phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

Fig. 230 shows the stress strain relations for the indiene of size 100×100 ˚A. The structure
is uniaxially stretched in the armchair or zigzag directions at 1 K. The Young’s modulus
is 8.4 Nm−1 in both armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K, which are obtained by linear
ﬁtting of the stress strain relations in [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus of the indiene is very
small; i.e., the indiene is very soft. As a result, we ﬁnd that the structure becomes unstable
at room temperature. The Poisson’s ratios from the VFF model and the SW potential are
νxy = νyx = 0.18. The third-order nonlinear elastic constant D can be obtained by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to σ = Eǫ + 1

of D are -42.0 Nm−1 and -50.2 Nm−1 at 1 K along the armchair and zigzag directions,
respectively. The ultimate stress is about 0.77 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.16 in the

for the single-layer blue phosphorus.
The structure of the single-layer blue phosphorus is shown in Fig. 222, with structural
parameters from the ab initio calculations.55 The blue phosphorus has a buckled conﬁgura-
tion as shown in Fig. 222 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. The height of
the buckle is h = 1.211 ˚A. The lattice constant is 3.326 ˚A, and the bond length is 2.270 ˚A.
Table CDL shows the VFF model for the single-layer blue phosphorus. The force con-
stant parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon
dispersion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 231 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 55. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio

The Young’s modulus is isotropic for the blue phosphorus.

We will also derive the SW potential based on the VFF model for the single-layer b-arsenene.
The structure of the single-layer b-arsenene is shown in Fig. 222, with structural param-
eters from the ab initio calculations.70 The b-arsenene has a buckled conﬁguration as shown
in Fig. 222 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. The height of the buckle is
h = 1.40 ˚A. The lattice constant is 3.61 ˚A, and the bond length is 2.51 ˚A.
Table CDLIV shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-arsenene. The force constant
parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the three acoustic branches in the phonon disper-

The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 70. Similar phonon dispersion can also be found in other ab initio
calculations.64,72,73 We note that the lowest-frequency branch aroung the Γ point from the
VFF model is lower than the ab initio results. This branch is the ﬂexural branch, which
should be a quadratic dispersion. However, the ab initio calculations give a linear dispersion
for the ﬂexural branch due to the violation of the rigid rotational invariance in the ﬁrst-
principles package,20 so ab initio calculations typically overestimate the frequency of this

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer b-CO under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 241 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer b-CO of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer b-CO is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
CO. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 99.1 N/m and 98.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.08.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-CO. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -513.8 N/m and -542.0 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 9.4 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.18 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 9.2 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.21 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

Present studies on the buckled (b-) CS are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no

The structure of the single-layer b-CS is shown in Fig. 239. The structural parameters
are from the ab initio calculations.78 The b-CS has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in
Fig. 239 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. This structure can be determined
by two independent geometrical parameters, including the lattice constant 2.836 ˚A and the

to the two in-plane acoustic branches in the long wave limit along the ΓM direction. The ab initio
results (gray pentagons) are calculated from SIESTA. (b) The VFF model (blue lines) and the SW

Table CDLXX shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-CS. The force constant pa-
rameters are determined by ﬁtting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion along
the ΓM as shown in Fig. 242 (a).
The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion
are calculated from the SIESTA package.79 The generalized gradients approximation is ap-
plied to account for the exchange-correlation function with Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
parameterization,80 and the double-ζ orbital basis set is adopted. Fig. 242 (b) shows that
the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW
potential is derived from the VFF model.

conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer b-CS is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
CS. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 63.5 N/m and 63.6 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.05.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-CS. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -352.5 N/m and -372.0 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 5.7 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.17 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 5.5 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.20 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

B-SIS
Present studies on the buckled (b-) SiS are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no
empirical potential has been proposed for the b-SiS. We will thus parametrize a set of SW
potential for the single-layer b-SiS in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-SiS is shown in Fig. 239. The structural parameters
are from the ab initio calculations.78 The b-SiS has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in
Fig. 239 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. This structure can be determined
by two independent geometrical parameters, including the lattice constant 3.299 ˚A and the
bond length 2.321 ˚A.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-

curve for the tension of a single-layer b-SiS of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer b-SiS is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
SiS. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 45.5 N/m and 45.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.13.

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-SiS. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -196.4 N/m and -217.9 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 5.1 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 4.9 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.24 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

GeO. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 47.5 N/m and 46.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.11.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-GeO. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -224.6 N/m and -232.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 4.9 Nm−1

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer b-SnO under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 265 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer b-SnO of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer b-SnO is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
SnO. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus are 43.7 N/m and 43.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Young’s modulus is essentially
isotropic in the armchair and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.12.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-SnO. We have

are from Ref. 114. Fig. 272 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer b-SnGe under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 273 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer b-SnGe of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer b-SnGe is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
SnGe. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 36.8 N/m along both armchair
and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is
νxy = νyx = 0.11.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-SnGe. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B

conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer b-InAs is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
InAs. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 33.9 N/m and 34.2 N/m along
the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.17.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-InAs. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -85.0 N/m and -130.2 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 7.3 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.32 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 7.5 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.32 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

Present studies on the buckled InSb (b-InSb) are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations,
and no empirical potential has been proposed for the b-InSb. We will thus parametrize a
set of SW potential for the single-layer b-InSb in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-InSb is shown in Fig. 239. The structural parameters
are from the ab initio calculations.114 The b-InSb has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in
Fig. 239 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. This structure can be determined
by two independent geometrical parameters, eg. the lattice constant 4.57 ˚A and the bond
length 2.74 ˚A. The resultant height of the buckle is h = 0.73 ˚A.

set of SW potential for the single-layer b-AlSb in this section.
The structure of the single-layer b-AlSb is shown in Fig. 239. The structural parameters
are from the ab initio calculations.114 The b-AlSb has a buckled conﬁguration as shown in
Fig. 239 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. This structure can be determined
by two independent geometrical parameters, eg. the lattice constant 4.33 ˚A and the bond
length 2.57 ˚A. The resultant height of the buckle is h = 0.60 ˚A.
Table DLXII shows the VFF model for the single-layer b-AlSb.
The force constant
parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the acoustic branches in the phonon dispersion
along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 288 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion
are from Ref. 114. Fig. 288 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DLXIII.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DLXIV.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. DLXV.
505We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer b-AlSb under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 289 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer b-AlSb of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer b-AlSb is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer b-
AlSb. The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation
in the small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 41.7 N/m and 42.0 N/m along
the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model
and the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.15.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer b-AlSb. We have
thus used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B
in most materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted
by ﬁtting the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s
modulus. The values of D from the present SW potential are -142.4 N/m and -190.8 N/m
along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 8.1 Nm−1
at the ultimate strain of 0.29 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The
ultimate stress is about 8.1 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.31 in the zigzag direction at
the low temperature of 1 K.

BO
Present studies on the BO are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no empirical
potential has been proposed for the BO. We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential for
the single-layer BO in this section.
The structure of the single-layer BO is shown in Fig. 290 with M=B and X=O. The
structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations.115 The BO has a bi-buckled con-
ﬁguration as shown in Fig. 290 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. Two
buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior B-B bonds, forming a bi-
buckled conﬁguration. This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical
parameters, eg. the lattice constant 2.44 ˚A, the bond length dB−O = 1.52 ˚A, and the bond
length dB−B = 1.77 ˚A.

Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. DLXXVII.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-

conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer GaO is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer GaO.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 137.2 N/m and 136.6 N/m along the

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer GaO. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -467.5 N/m and -529.6 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 19.6 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.28 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 20.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.35 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer InO is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer InO.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 85.7 N/m along the armchair

There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer InO. We have thus

We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer BS under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 300 shows the stress-strain curve
for the tension of a single-layer BS of dimension 100×100 ˚A. Periodic boundary conditions are
applied in both armchair and zigzag directions. The single-layer BS is stretched uniaxially
along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without involving the actual
thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer BS. The Young’s modulus
can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the small strain range of
[0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 179.4 N/m and 178.5 N/m along the armchair and zigzag
directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is
νxy = νyx = 0.16.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer BS. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting

The values of D from the present SW potential are -793.2 N/m and -823.2 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 20.0 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.21 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate

buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior Ga-Ga bonds, forming a
bi-buckled conﬁguration. This structure can be determined by three independent geomet-
rical parameters, eg. the lattice constant 3.64 ˚A, the bond length dGa−S = 2.36 ˚A, and the
bond length dGa−Ga = 2.47 ˚A.
Table DXC shows the VFF model for the single-layer GaS. The force constant parameters
are determined by ﬁtting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dispersion along
the ΓM as shown in Fig. 303 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are
from Ref. 115. Fig. 303 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DXCI.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DXCII.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. DXCIII.

curve for the tension of a single-layer GaS of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer GaS is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer GaS.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01].
The Young’s modulus is 76.2 N/m along the armchair
and zigzag directions. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and the SW potential is
νxy = νyx = 0.23.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer GaS. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materigas. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -254.5 N/m and -269.8 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 10.8 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.26 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 11.0 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.36 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

ALSE
Present studies on the AlSe are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no empirical
potential has been proposed for the AlSe. We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential
for the single-layer AlSe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer AlSe is shown in Fig. 290 with M=Al and X=Se. The
structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations.115 The AlSe has a bi-buckled
conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 290 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. Two
buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior Al-Al bonds, forming a bi-
buckled conﬁguration. This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical
parameters, eg. the lattice constant 3.78 ˚A, the bond length dAl−Se = 2.47 ˚A, and the bond
length dAl−Al = 2.57 ˚A.
Table DCII shows the VFF model for the single-layer AlSe. The force constant parameters
are determined by ﬁtting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dispersion along
the ΓM as shown in Fig. 309 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon dispersion are
from Ref. 115. Fig. 309 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW potential give exactly
the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DCIII.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DCIV.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. DCV.
539We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer AlSe under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 310 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer AlSe of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer AlSe is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer AlSe.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 69.4 N/m and 69.2 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and
the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.24.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer AlSe. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1

The values of D from the present SW potential are -217.3 N/m and -231.9 N/m along the

GASE
Present studies on the GaSe are based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, and no empirical
potential has been proposed for the GaSe. We will thus parametrize a set of SW potential
for the single-layer GaSe in this section.
The structure of the single-layer GaSe is shown in Fig. 290 with M=Ga and X=Se. The
structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations.115 The GaSe has a bi-buckled
conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 290 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. Two
buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior Ga-Ga bonds, forming a bi-
buckled conﬁguration. This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical
parameters, eg. the lattice constant 3.82 ˚A, the bond length dGa−Se = 2.50 ˚A, and the bond
length dGa−Ga = 2.46 ˚A.

conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer GaSe is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer GaSe.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 68.3 N/m and 67.9 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and
the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.25.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer GaSe. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -206.1 N/m and -219.8 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 10.5 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.27 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 10.8 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.39 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the

structural parameters are from the ab initio calculations.115 The AlTe has a bi-buckled
conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 290 (b), where the buckle is along the zigzag direction. Two
buckling layers are symmetrically integrated through the interior Al-Al bonds, forming a bi-
buckled conﬁguration. This structure can be determined by three independent geometrical

Table DCXVIII shows the VFF model for the single-layer AlTe.
The force constant
parameters are determined by ﬁtting to the six low-frequency branches in the phonon dis-
persion along the ΓM as shown in Fig. 317 (a). The ab initio calculations for the phonon
dispersion are from Ref. 115. Fig. 317 (b) shows that the VFF model and the SW poten-
tial give exactly the same phonon dispersion, as the SW potential is derived from the VFF
model.
The parameters for the two-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DCXIX.
The parameters for the three-body SW potential used by GULP are shown in Tab. DCXX.
Parameters for the SW potential used by LAMMPS are listed in Tab. DCXXI.
We use LAMMPS to perform MD simulations for the mechanical behavior of the single-
layer AlTe under uniaxial tension at 1.0 K and 300.0 K. Fig. 318 shows the stress-strain
curve for the tension of a single-layer AlTe of dimension 100 × 100 ˚A. Periodic boundary
conditions are applied in both armchair and zigzag directions.
The single-layer AlTe is
stretched uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction. The stress is calculated without
involving the actual thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional structure of the single-layer AlTe.
The Young’s modulus can be obtained by a linear ﬁtting of the stress-strain relation in the
small strain range of [0, 0.01]. The Young’s modulus is 55.8 N/m and 54.9 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The Poisson’s ratio from the VFF model and
the SW potential is νxy = νyx = 0.24.
There is no available value for nonlinear quantities in the single-layer AlTe. We have thus
used the nonlinear parameter B = 0.5d4 in Eq. (5), which is close to the value of B in most
materials. The value of the third order nonlinear elasticity D can be extracted by ﬁtting
the stress-strain relation to the function σ = Eǫ + 1
2Dǫ2 with E as the Young’s modulus.
The values of D from the present SW potential are -171.4 N/m and -179.0 N/m along the
armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The ultimate stress is about 8.4 Nm−1 at the
ultimate strain of 0.27 in the armchair direction at the low temperature of 1 K. The ultimate
stress is about 8.6 Nm−1 at the ultimate strain of 0.39 in the zigzag direction at the low
temperature of 1 K.

BOROPHENE
Most existing theoretical studies on the monolayer of boron atoms (borophene) are based
on the ﬁrst-principles calculations. The ReaxFF force ﬁeld model was developed for the
borophene recently.117 The present authors have provided the VFF model and the SW
potential to describe the atomic interaction within the borophene,14 which includes the
second-nearest-neighboring interactions. In the present work, we present a more eﬃcient
SW potential with only the ﬁrst-nearest-neighboring interactions.
The structure of the borophene is shown in Fig. 323, with structural parameters from the
ab initio calculations.116 Borophene has a puckered conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 323 (b),
where the pucker is perpendicular to the x-direction. The height of the pucker is h = 0.911 ˚A,
which is the distance between the top chain and the bottom chain along the out-of-plane

The two lattice bases are a1 = 2.866 ˚A and a2 = 1.614 ˚A for the inplane
rectangular unit cell. There are two inequivalent boron atoms in the unit cell. Boron atoms
are categorized into the top chain and the bottom chain. The top chain includes atoms like
1, 4, and 7. The bottom chain includes atoms like 2, 3, 5, and 6.

respectively, which are quite comparable with the ab initio results.
The third-order nonlinear constant (D) can be obtained by ﬁtting the stress strain relation
to the function σ = Eǫ+ 1
2Dǫ2, with E as the Young’s modulus. The obtained values of D are
-1100.1 Nm−1 and -2173.6 Nm−1 in the x and y directions, respectively. The ultimate stress
is about 12.3 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.17 in the x-direction at the low temperature
of 1 K, which agree quite well with the ab initio results at 0 K.116,118,120 The ultimate stress
is about 32.9 Nm−1 at the critical strain of 0.16 in the y-direction at the low temperature
of 1 K, which are quite comparable with ab initio results at 0 K.116,118,120

CONCLUSION REMARKS
As a ﬁnal remark, we note some major advantages and deﬁciencies for the SW potential
parameters provided in the present work. On the one hand, the key feature of the SW
potential is its high eﬃciency, which is maintained by using minimum potential parameters
in the present work, so the interaction range is limited to the ﬁrst-nearest-neighboring atoms.
As a result, the present SW potential parameters are of high computational eﬃciency. On
the other hand, since the interaction is limited to short-range, the optical branches in the
phonon spectrum are typically overestimated by the present SW potential. It is because we
have ignored the long-range interactions, which contribute mostly to the acoustic phonon
branches while have neglectable contribution to the optical phonon branches. The short-
range interaction has thus been strengthened to give an accurate description for the acoustic
phonon branches and the elastic properties, which leads to the overestimation of the optical
phonon branches as a trade oﬀ. Hence, there will be systematic overestimation for simulating
565optical processes using the present SW parameters.
We also note that the mathematical form of the SW potential is not suitable for the
atomic-thick planar structures, such as graphene and b-BN, because the SW potential are
not able to resist the bending motion of these real planar crystals.121,122
In conclusion, we have provided the SW potential parameters for 156 layered crystals.
The supplemental resources for all simulations in the present work are available online in
Ref. 1, including a fortran code to generate crystals’ structures, ﬁles for molecular dynamics
simulations using LAMMPS, ﬁles for phonon calculation with the SW potential using GULP,
and ﬁles for phonon calculations with the valence force ﬁeld model using GULP.
