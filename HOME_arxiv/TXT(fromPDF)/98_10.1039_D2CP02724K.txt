The combination of piezoelectricity with nontrivial topological insulating phase in two-dimensional
(2D) systems, namely piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulator (PQSHI), is intriguing for exploring
novel topological states toward the development of high-speed and dissipationless electronic devices.
In this work, we predict a PQSHI Janus monolayer VCClBr constructed from VCCl2, which is
dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. In the absence of spin orbital coupling (SOC),
VCClBr is a narrow gap semiconductor with gap value of 57 meV, which is diﬀerent from Dirac
semimetal VCCl2.
The gap of VCClBr is due to built-in electric ﬁeld caused by asymmetrical
upper and lower atomic layers, which is further conﬁrmed by external-electric-ﬁeld induced gap in
VCCl2. When including SOC, the gap of VCClBr is improved to 76 meV, which is larger than the
thermal energy of room temperature (25 meV). The VCClBr is a 2D topological insulator (TI),
which is conﬁrmed by Z2 topological invariant and nontrivial one-dimensional edge states. It is
proved that the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr are robust against strain (biaxial and
uniaxial cases) and external electric ﬁeld. Due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, only out-of-
plane piezoelectric response can be observed, when biaxial or uniaxial in-plane strain is applied.
The predicted piezoelectric strain coeﬃcients d31 and d32 are -0.425 pm/V and -0.219 pm/V, which
are higher than or compared with ones of many 2D materials. Finally, another two Janus monolayer
VCFBr and VCFCl (dynamically unstable) are constructed, and they are still PQSHIs. Moreover,
their d31 and d32 are higher than ones of VCClBr, and the d31 (absolute value) of VCFBr is larger
than one.
According to out-of-plane piezoelectric coeﬃcients of VCXY (X̸=Y=F, Cl and Br),
CrX1.5Y1.5 (X=F, Cl and Br; Y=I) and NiXY (X̸=Y=Cl, Br and I), it is concluded that the size
of out-of-plane piezoelectric coeﬃcient has a positive relation with electronegativity diﬀerence of
X and Y atoms. Our works enrich the diversity of Janus 2D materials, and open a new avenue
in searching for PQSHI with large out-of-plane piezoelectric response, which provides a potential
platform in nanoelectronics.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of 2D materials has spurred a surge of
experimental and theoretical interests in understanding
their physical and chemical properties.
The piezoelec-
tricity of 2D materials has been a research hotspot in
the ever-increasing energy conversion area1,2, which re-
quires a 2D system to be non-centrosymmetrical. The
2H-MoS2 is a typical 2D piezoelectric material, which
has been conﬁrmed experimentally3.
In theory, piezo-
electric properties of many 2D materials have been
reported4–10.
Strong in-plane piezoelectric response is
common, while large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain co-
eﬃcient is rare. Searching for 2D materials with large
out-of-plane piezoelectric response has become an im-
portant quest due to its compatibility with bottom/top
gate technologies.
Another interesting feature of 2D
systems is nontrivial topology, and TI of them is also
called as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) with
spin-momentum-locked conducting edge states.
The
ﬁrst QSHI is predicted in graphene11, and then the
HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells are experi-
mentally conﬁrmed as QSHIs12,13. Theoretically, many
2D systems have been proposed as QSHIs by ﬁrst-
principle calculations14–19.
Searching for QSHI with
large gap (larger than 25 meV) is very important for
room temperature device applications.
Multifunctional 2D materials are of particular interest
due to providing a potential platform for multi-functional
electronic devices. Compared to individual piezoelectric-
ity or nontrivial band topology in a single 2D material,
their combination can provide a unique opportunity for
intriguing physics and practical device applications. To
search PQSHI, there are two ways :(1) seeking for non-
trivial band topology from 2D piezoelectric materials;
(2) ﬁnding or constructing non-centrosymmetrical QSHI,
which may be a executable method, especially for sand-
wich structure. It is well known that a sandwich struc-
ture can be used as a parent to construct Janus struc-
ture, which lacks central symmetry, giving rise to piezo-
electric eﬀect20–22. The typical Janus MoSSe monolayer
has been experimentally synthesized based on MoS2 with
symmetrical upper and lower atomic layers23,24. How-
ever, the nontrivial topology may be broken by building
Janus structure from a QSHI22,25. The Janus SrAlGaSe4
and MoSSe as derivatives of QSHI SrGa2Se4 and 1T’-
MoS2 lose nontrivial topology. However, strain can make
them possess topological properties of their parents22,25.2

K.
Recently, based on VOCl as a prototype, 20 2D mono-
layers VXY (X = B, C, N, O and F; Y = F, Cl, Br and I)
are predicted by means of ﬁrst-principles calculations26.
They possess emerging topological, magnetic and dielec-
tric properties, which depend electron occupation, ligand
electronegativity and crystal ﬁeld strength. Calculated
results demonstrate that the VCY systems exhibit non-
trivial topological properties26. Their crystal structure
possesses central symmetry, which leads to disappeared
piezoelectricity. However, this structure can be regarded
as a sandwich structure. These provide a possibility to
induce PQSHI by constructing Janus structure based on
VCY monolayer as parent.
In this work, we build a Janus crystal structure VC-
ClBr, which can be attained by replacing the top Cl layer
in VCCl2 monolayer with Br atoms. Calculated results
show that VCClBr indeed is a PQSHI with dynamical,
mechanical and thermal stabilities.
It is proved that
nontrivial band topology of VCClBr is robust against
strain and external electric ﬁeld.
The calculated out-
of-plane piezoelectric response is strong compared with
ones of many 2D materials5,7, like Janus transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers. Finally, by analysing
out-of-plane piezoelectric coeﬃcients of VCXY (X̸=Y=F,
Cl and Br), CrX1.5Y1.5 (X=F, Cl and Br; Y=I)27 and
NiXY (X̸=Y=Cl, Br and I)28, the strong out-of-plane

devices.

CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AND STABILITY
As shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), the middle VC layer
of VCClBr is sandwiched by Cl and Br layers, which can
be considered as a Janus structure.
The VCClBr can
be constructed by replacing top Cl atom layer in VCCl2
monolayer with Br atoms. Its each V atom is 6- fold coor-
dinated with four C , one Cl and one Br atoms, giving rise
to a strongly distorted octahedron unit. The symmetry
of VCClBr (No.25) is lower than that of VCCl2 (No.59)
due to the lack of horizontal mirror symmetry. Namely,
the VCCl2 has centrosymmetry with disappeared piezo-
electricity, while the VCClBr lacks inversion symmetry,
possessing piezoelectricity.
The optimized lattice con-
stant of VCClBr is a=3.257 ˚A and b=3.959 ˚A. Due to
diﬀerent atomic sizes and electronegativities of Cl and
Br atoms, inequivalent bond lengths can be observed, for
example dCl−V =2.449 ˚A and dBr−V =2.575 ˚A, which can
induce an electrostatic potential gradient, giving rise to
a built-in electric ﬁeld.
To validate its dynamic stability, the phonon disper-
sions of VCClBr are calculated, which is plotted in Fig-
ure 1 (c).
No imaginary vibrational frequency with
three acoustic and ﬁfteen optical phonon branches is ob-
served, suggesting that VCClBr is dynamically stable.
In addition, by performing ab-initio molecular dynam-
ics (AIMD) simulations, the thermal stability of VCClBr
with a supercell of 4×4×1 for more than 8000 fs at 300 K
is examined. The total energy ﬂuctuations as a function
of simulation time along with the ﬁnal conﬁgurations are
plotted in Figure 1 (d). Calculated results show that VC-
ClBr undergoes no structural reconstruction with small
energy ﬂuctuates, indicating its thermal stability.
To further check the mechanical stability of VCClBr,
its elastic constants are calculated. By using Voigt nota-
tion, the elastic tensor with mm2 point-group symmetry
can be written as:
C =

C12=17.08 Nm−1 and C66=53.45 Nm−1. The calculated
elastic constants satisfy the Born criteria of mechanical
stability:
C11 > 0,
C22 > 0,
C66 > 0,
C11 −C12 > 0
(2)
Therefore, VCClBr is mechanically stable.
Since the C11 and C22 of VCClBr are very diﬀerent, the
anisotropy of its Young’s moduli C2D(θ) and Poisson’s
ratios ν2D(θ) should be very distinct.
The direction-
dependent C2D(θ) and ν2D(θ) can be attained by the
following two formulas39,40:
C2D(θ) =
C11C22 −C2
12
C11m4 + C22n4 + (B −2C12)m2n2
(3)
ν2D(θ) = (C11 + C22 −B)m2n2 −C12(m4 + n4)
C11m4 + C22n4 + (B −2C12)m2n2
(4)
where the θ is the angle of direction with x/y direc-
tion deﬁned as as 0◦/90◦, m = sin(θ), n = cos(θ)
and B = (C11C22 −C2
12)/C66. As plotted in Figure 2,
the C2D(θ) and ν2D(θ) of VCClBr show very strong
anisotropy. The C2D is 129.32/213.58 Nm−1 along x/y
direction, and 0.079/0.131 for ν2D.5

The energy band structures of VCClBr by using GGA
and GGA+SOC are plotted in Figure 3. In the absence of
SOC, the VCClBr is a direct gap semiconductor with the
gap of 57 meV, and the valence band maximum (VBM)
and conduction band minimum (CBM) locate at the one
point along Γ-Y path. It clearly seen that the very strong
anisotropy is observed for energy band structures along

Γ-X and Γ-Y paths. When including SOC, the VCClBr is
still a direct gap semiconductor, and the gap is improved
to 76 meV. The previous calculated results show that
VCCl2 is a QSHI26. The Janus monolayer SrAlGaSe4 as
a derivative of centrosymmetric QSHI SrGa2Se4 is a nor-
mal insulator, which can be reverted by strain22. How-
ever, Janus monolayer CSb1.5Bi1.5 still maintains non-
trivial topological properties from QSHI CX3 (X=Sb and
Bi) with inversion symmetry41. To conﬁrm the topologi-
cal properties of VCClBr, the Z2 topological invariant is
calculated. For a material with inversion symmetry, Z2
topological invariant can be attained from the product
of parities of all occupied states at four time-reversal-
invariant-momentum points in the 2D BZ. However, VC-
ClBr is non-centrosymmetrical, and the Z2 can be veri-
ﬁed by the calculation of Wannier charge center (WCC).
If Z2 equals 1/0, a material is a topologically nontriv-
ial/trivial state.
As plotted in Figure 4, an arbitrary
reference line crosses the evolution lines of WCC an odd
number of times, giving rise to Z2=1, which indicates
that VCClBr is a QSHI. Furthermore, a QSHI should ex-
hibit non-trivial topological edge states. We further cal-
culate one-dimensional edge states on (100) edge, which
are plotted in Figure 4. It is clearly seen that topological
helical edge states with the appearance of the Dirac cone
connect the conduction and valence bands. The HSE06 is
also employed to check the reliability of nontrivial topo-
logical properties of VCClBr. Within HSE06+SOC, the
energy band structure and one-dimensional edge states
are plotted in Figure 5. Calculated results show that the
gap of VCClBr is improved to 87 meV from 76 meV with
GGA+SOC, and the nontrivial topological properties are6

still kept with topological helical edge states.
The VCCl2 is a Dirac semimetal without considering
SOC, and no opened gap is observed26.
Compared to
VCCl2, VCClBr lacks horizontal mirror symmetry, pos-
sessing a built-in electric ﬁeld, which induces the opened
gap. To conﬁrm this, we apply an external electric ﬁeld
(E) perpendicular to the VCCl2, which should induce a
gap. Since the electric ﬁeld is a vector (not a pseudovec-
tor), the horizontal mirror symmetry will be broken by
electric ﬁeld.
This is diﬀerent from the magnetization
as a pseudovector, which preserves the horizontal mirror
symmetry. Thus, applying an external electric ﬁeld can
be used to simulate Janus structure (see Figure 6) in a
sense.
For VCCl2 monolayer, the evolution of band gap as a
function of applied electric ﬁeld is provided in Figure 7 by
using GGA and GGA+SOC, and the representative en-
ergy bands under 0.00 eV/˚A and 0.04 eV/˚A electric ﬁeld
are plotted in Figure 8. In the absence of SOC, the band
gap increases monotonously from 0 meV with increasing
electric ﬁeld for VCCl2. This implies that applied electric
ﬁeld can induce the gap for VCCl2, which is equivalent to
a built-in electric ﬁeld by constructing Janus structure,
like VCClBr. For example 0.04 eV/˚A electric ﬁeld, the
gap of VCCl2 is 73 meV without considering SOC, and
the GGA+SOC gap is reduced to 67 meV. It is noted
that the gap with GGA+SOC is larger than one with
GGA under small electric ﬁeld, and then the opposite
situation is observed with sequentially increasing elec-
tric ﬁeld. Finally, the edge states are calculated within
considered E range. It is found that the nontrivial topo-
logical properties of VCCl2 are robust against applied
electric ﬁeld, and the representative topological helical
edge states under 0.40 eV/˚A electric ﬁeld are plotted in
FIG.1 of electronic supplementary information (ESI).
The electric ﬁeld eﬀects on electronic and topological
properties of VCClBr are also investigated. Janus VC-
ClBr has diﬀerent atomic species on its upper and lower
facets (see Figure 6), which means that applying +z and
−z directional electric ﬁeld are not equivalent. This is
diﬀerent from VCCl2, which has the same atomic species
on its upper and lower facets (see Figure 6), giving rise to7

equivalent eﬀects caused by applying both +z and −z di-
rectional electric ﬁeld. The energy band gaps of VCClBr
monolayer as a function of applied electric ﬁeld along
+z and -z directions by using GGA+SOC are plotted
in Figure 7. The gap increases with increasing +z di-
rectional E, while increasing −z directional E reduces
the gap. However, the gap change is very small with E
from 0.00 eV/˚A to 0.40 eV/˚A, and only 5.1/-3.6 meV for
+z and −z directional E, which is very smaller than one
(37.3 meV) of VCCl2. It is also proved that the nontriv-
ial topological properties of VCClBr are robust against
applied electric ﬁeld.
Strain is an eﬀective method to tune electronic prop-
erties of 2D systems, and further aﬀects their topological
properties42–44. Here, both biaxial and uniaxial strains
are considered to investigate the robustness of nontriv-
ial topological properties of VCClBr. The L/L0 is used
to simulate compressive/tensile strain, where L and L0
are the strained and unstrained lattice constants, respec-
tively. The L/L0<1 (L/L0>1) means compressive (ten-
sile) strain. For biaxial strain, the a and b lattice param-
eters simultaneously change, and atomic positions are al-
lowed to relax. For uniaxial strain, the a/b lattice param-
eter changes, and the b/a lattice parameter and atomic
positions are allowed to relax in response to an applied
in-plane uniaxial strain.
The electronic structures versus L/L0 are calculated
by using GGA+SOC. The variation of band gaps with
biaxial, uniaxial-a and uniaxial-b cases are plotted in
Figure 7, and the energy band structures at represen-
tative applied strain are shown in Figure 9. For biaxial
strain, with increasing strain, the gap ﬁrstly increases,
and then decreases, which is due to the transition of
CBM from one point along Γ-S to one point along Γ-
Y. It is found that both compressive and tensile strains
can induce semiconductor-metal transitions, which are
due to the variation of CBM and VBM. Our calculated
results show that the nontrivial topological properties
are robust within considered strain range. For 0.96 or
1.04 strain, VCClBr is a metal, but the gap along Γ-
Y path is still maintained, and topological helical edge
states still exist (see FIG.2 of ESI). Partly, the uniaxial-a
compressive/tensile strain is equivalent to uniaxial-b ten-
sile/compressive one, which can be conﬁrmed by their
gaps versus L/L0. It is found that uniaxial strain can also
induce the change of CBM or VBM, giving rise to non-
monotonic dependence of gap on L/L0. Semiconductor-
metal transitions can also be observed at uniaxial-a 0.96
strain.
However, the gap along Γ-Y path always ex-
ists. The topological helical edge states can always be
observed with considered uniaxial strain range, which
are plotted in FIG.3 and FIG.4 of ESI at 0.96 and 1.04
strains.

PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES
For noncentrosymmetric material, an applied strain or
stress can induce electric dipole moments and produce
electricity, called piezoelectric eﬀect. The pristine VCCl2
is non-piezoelectric, while VCClBr with particular Janus
structure possessess piezoelectric eﬀect. The third-rank
piezoelectric stress tensor eijk and strain tensor dijk can
be used to describe piezoelectric response of a material.
The relaxed piezoelectric tensors (eijk and dijk) are ob-
tained as the sum of ionic and electronic contributions:
eijk = ∂Pi
∂εjk
= eelc
ijk + eion
ijk
(5)
and
dijk = ∂Pi
∂σjk
= delc
ijk + dion

(6)
Where Pi, εjk and σjk are polarization vector, strain
and stress, respectively, and the superscripts elc and ion
mean electronic and ionic contributions. The eelc
ijk and
delc
ijk (eijk and dijk) are also called clamped-ion (relax-
ion) piezoelectric coeﬃcients. The eijk and dijk can be
connected by elastic tensor Cmnjk:
eijk = ∂Pi

strain and stress are taken into account. However, the
polarization can be allowed to remain out-of-plane. We
deﬁne the in-plane directions x1 and x2 as the short edge
and long edge direction of primitive cell, and x3 as per-
pendicular to the 2D layer. Employing Voigt notation,
the piezoelectric stress and strain tensors due to mm2
point group symmetry can be reduced into :

When a uniaxial in-plane strain is applied, only a ver-
tical piezoelectric polarization exists (d31̸=0 or d32̸=0).
Moreover, with applied biaxial in-plane strain, the su-
perposed out-of-plane polarization will arise (d31̸=0 and
d32̸=0). The e31 and e32 can be directly calculated by
DFPT, and the d31 and d32 can be derived by Equa-
tion 1, Equation 7, Equation 8 and Equation 9:
d31 = e31C22 −e32C12

The calculated e31 (e32) is -0.593×10−10 C/m (-
0.545×10−10 C/m) with ionic part 0.019×10−10 C/m
(-0.032×10−10 C/m) and electronic part -0.612×10−10
C/m (-0.513×10−10 C/m). The electronic and ionic po-
larizations of e31 have opposite signs, while they have
the same signs for e32. However, the electronic contribu-
tion dominates the piezoelectricity of both e31 and e32.
Based on Equation 10 and Equation 11, the d31 and d32
can be attained from previous calculated Cij and eij.
The calculated d31 (d32) is -0.425 pm/V (-0.219 pm/V),
which are higher than or compared with ones of other
2D materials5,7. The d31 is almost twice as large as d32,
which is mainly due to very diﬀerent C11 and C22. Thus,
VCClBr is a potential PQSHI.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
The VCY2 (Y=F, Cl, Br and I) monolayers have been
predicted to be topological Dirac semimetals without
SOC26. However, for VCI2, the Fermi level deviates from
Dirac point. Thus, based on VCY2 (Y=F, Cl and Br)
monolayers, we construct another two Janus monolayer
VCFBr and VCFCl of VCXY (X̸=Y=F, Cl and Br). The
optimized lattice constants a and b are listed in Table I.
It is found that a increases with the size of X and Y an-
ions (from VCFCl to VCFBr to VCClBr), while b is less
aﬀected, which is because the X and Y anions are directly
bonded to V atoms along x direction. The energy band
structures of VCFBr and VCFCl within SOC are plotted
in Figure 10. Calculated results show that VCFCl and
VCClBr are direct gap semiconductors, while VCFBr is
an indirect gap semiconductor. The CBM of VCFBr is
at one point along Γ-S path, while the VBM locates at
one point along Γ-Y path. For VCFCl and VCClBr, both
CBM and VBM locate at one point along Γ-Y path. As
summarized in Table I, the gap increases with the size of
X and Y anions (from VCFCl to VCFBr to VCClBr). It
is clearly seen that topological helical edge states connect
the valence and conduction bands of VCFBr and VCFCl
(see Figure 11), conﬁrming their nontrivial topological
properties.
For monolayer VCClBr, VCFBr and VCFCl, the calcu-
lated elastic constants Cij, piezoelectric stress coeﬃcient
eij along with electronic and ionic parts, and piezoelec-
tric strain coeﬃcient dij are listed in Table II. For these
monolayers, calculated elastic constants satisfy mechan-
ical stability criteria, conﬁrming their mechanical stabil-
ities. For all these monolayers, the electronic and ionic
contributions of e31 have opposite signs, while they have
the same signs for e32, and the electronic part dominates
e31 and e32. For three monolayers, the d31 is larger than
d32. The d31 and d32 of VCFBr are the largest among
these monolayers, which may be due to very diﬀerent
electronegativities of F and Br atoms compared with F
and Cl or Cl and Br atoms. The d31 and d32 (absolute
value) of VCXY (X̸=Y=F, Cl and Br) along with the
electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms are plot-
ted in Figure 12. Similar phenomenon can be found in
monolayer CrX1.5Y1.5 (X=F, Cl and Br; Y=I) and NiXY
(X̸=Y=Cl, Br and I)27,28, and their d31 along with the
electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms are also
plotted in Figure 12.
It is clearly seen that the large
electronegativity diﬀerence of X and Y atoms is related
with large out-of-plane piezoelectric response. It is noted
that the d31 of VCFBr is larger than 1.0 pm/V, which is
rare for out-of-plane piezoelectric response of 2D systems.
Finally, the phonon dispersions of VCFBr and VCFCl
are calculated, which are plotted in FIG.5 of ESI. Unfor-
tunately, the two monolayers are dynamically unstable
due to existing imaginary frequencies.
However, these
comparisons provide some thoughts and scientiﬁc basis
for searching large out-of-plane piezoelectric response in
Janus 2D materials.
In summary, we have demonstrated coexistence of
piezoelectricity and robust nontrivial band topology in
Janus VCClBr monolayer with dynamical, mechanical
and thermal stabilities based on the reliable DFT cal-
culations. The nontrivial band topology in Janus VC-
ClBr monolayer is conﬁrmed by topological helical edge
states, which is robust against strain and external electric
ﬁeld. Only out-of-plane piezoelectric response exists due
to broken horizontal mirror symmetry.
The predicted
out-of-plane d31 and d32 are higher than or comparable
with ones of many 2D known materials, which is highly
desirable for ultrathin piezoelectric devices. It is found
that the elastic, electronic and piezoelectric properties of
VCClBr monolayer show very strong anisotropy due to
the Cl and Br anions directly bonded to V atoms along
the x direction. Our predicted VCClBr provides a pos-
sible platform to future development of multifunctional
piezoelectronics, and these ﬁndings open new idea to real-
ize PQSHI with large out-of-plane piezoelectric response.
