Abstract 
 The van der Waals heterostructures of allotropes of phosphorene (Œ±- and Œ≤-P) with MoSe2 (H-, T-
, ZT- and SO-MoSe2) are investigated in the framework of state-of-the-art density functional theory. 
The semiconducting heterostructures, Œ≤-P /H-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / H-MoSe2, forms anti-type structures 
with type I and type II band alignments, respectively, whose bands are tunable with external electric 
field.  Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 form ohmic semiconductor-metal contacts while Schottky 
barrier in Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2 can be reduced to zero by external electric field to form ohmic contact which 
is useful to realize high-performance devices. Simulated STM images of given heterostructures reveal 
that Œ±-P can be used as a capping layer to differentiate between various allotropes of underlying 
MoSe2. The dielectric response of considered heterostructures is highly anisotropic in terms of lateral 
and vertical polarization. The tunable electronic and dielectric response of van der Waals 
phosphorene/MoSe2 heterostructure may find potentials applications in the fabrication of 
optoelectronic devices.3 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Phosphorene with its semiconducting nature is newly included member in the family of two 
dimensional (2D) materials which is a potential candidate for nano- and opto-electronic applications 
due to its exceptional properties such as strong structural anisotropy, high mechanical strength, large 
lateral flexibility and high conductivity [1, 2]. The black phosphorene (Œ±-P) exhibit puckered structure 
[3], whereas blue phosphorene (Œ≤-P) possess graphene-like honeycomb structure of phosphorous 
atoms [4]. Both Œ±- and Œ≤-P are semiconductors with band gap ~1eV and ~2eV, respectively [4, 5]. 
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are another family of 2D materials [6] with tunable 
electronic and dielectric properties [7-9]. The monolayers of TMDs are triatomic, in which the metal 
atoms are sandwiched between two atomic planes of chalcogen atoms. MoS2 is a prototype material 
which is most explored among the TMDs [10].  
Monolayer MoSe2 is also emerging as a novel contender in electronic applications similar to MoS2 
with the fabrication of few-layer MoSe2 based FETs having Ni and Ti electrode contacts possessing 
Ô¨Åeld-eÔ¨Äect mobility of 150‚àí200 cm2/(V¬∑s) and a current on/oÔ¨Ä ratio up to 106 [11, 12]. The layered 
crystal structure of MoSe2 is found to exhibit two phases i.e., the trigonal prismatic phase (H-MoSe2) 
and octahedral coordinated phase (T-MoSe2), with 3 atoms in a hexagonal unitcell.  The Se atoms lie 
directly above one another in H-MoSe2, while they are displaced in case of T-MoSe2. Another stable 
allotrope of MoSe2 can be formed by repeating square octagon pairs in a square unitcell, which consists 
of 12 atoms per unitcell [13].  
The absence of dangling bonds in 2D materials make it possible to reassemble the layers of these 
materials to form van der Waals heterostructures [14-17]. This layer by layer structure formed by the 
combination of two or more different materials, preserve the properties of these materials without4 
 
much degradation and in addition exhibit some unusual phenomena too [18, 19]. The phosphorene 
based heterostructures have been used to develop novel devices for nanoelectronic applications in 
recent past e.g.  STM images  of h-BN/phosphorene heterostructure with h-BN as a capping layer is 
useful to distinguish between different structural phases of phosphorene [20]; phosphorene/MoS2 acts 
as CMOS inverter [21] with its possible use as a channel material for electronic applications [22]; 
phosphorene/graphene heterostructure display potential application as electrode materials for batteries 
[23]; metal/black-phosphorene heterostructures such as Zn/BP and In/BP forms Schottkey contacts 
while Cu/BP forms ohmic contact [24] in devices. Similarly, heterostructures based on MoSe2 are also 
found to be suitable for device applications such as the MoSe2/graphene heterostructures show rapid 
transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between MoSe2 and graphene which depicts its possible 
applications in optoelectronics [25]; black phosphorene/MoSe2 heterostructure show potential 
applications in p-n diodes and logical devices [26];etc.  
In the present work, we construct the novel commensurable heterostructures of black and blue 
phosphorene with various phases of monolayer MoSe2 which show variable electronic structure on the 
influence of external electric field. Mechanical properties and simulated STM images of given 
heterostructures are also investigated. Obtained dielectric response is highly dependent on the 
direction of polarization.      
2. Computational Method 
SIESTA simulation package have been used to perform all the calculations [27]. The fully separable 
Kleinman and Bylander form of norm- conserving Troullier Martin pseudopotential has been used to 
treat the electron-ion interactions [28]. The van der Waals (vdW)-DRSLL functional have been 
employed in the present work to treat the exchange and correlation energies [29]. The Kohn Sham5 
 
orbitals are expanded as a linear combination of numerical pseudo atomic orbitals using a split-valence 
double zeta basis set with polarization functions (DZP). Throughout geometry optimization, the 
confinement energy of numerical pseudo-atomic orbitals is taken as 0.01 Ry. Minimization of energy 
was carried out using standard conjugate-gradient (CG) technique. Structures were relaxed until the 
forces on each atom were less than 0.01 eV/√Ö. Monkhorst-Pack scheme is used to sample Brillouin 
zone with a 10√ó10√ó1 mesh for the calculations based on hetero-bilayers and a 30√ó30√ó1 mesh for 
homo-bilayers. The spacing of the real space used to calculate the Hartree exchange and correlation 
contribution of the total energy and Hamiltonian was 450 Ry. A vacuum region of about 20 √Ö 
perpendicular to 2D plane has been used in calculations to prevent the superficial interactions between 
the periodic images.  The dielectric properties have been investigated by calculating the dipolar 
transition matrix elements between occupied and unoccupied single-electron eigenstates by means of 
first order time-dependent perturbation theory as implemented in SIESTA [27]. The static dielectric 
constant ( ÔÅ•ùë†) is calculated as the value of the real part of the dielectric function at zero frequency, 
while electron energy loss spectra (EELS) is obtained from dielectric functions (ÔÅ•1and ÔÅ•2) using the 
formula:

3. Results and Discussions 
The commensurable vertical heterostructures of two phosphorene allotropes namely Œ±-P and Œ≤-P, 
are constructed with four phases of MoSe2 namely hexagonal (H-MoSe2), tetragonal (T-MoSe2), 
distorted tetragonal (ZT-MoSe2) and square octagon (SO-MoSe2) (Figure 1). Note that ZT-phase of 
MoSe2 is the distorted phase which is obtained after full structural optimization of the rectangular 
unitcell of T-MoSe2 (Figure S1 of ESI), which is found to be stable in previous studies on MoS2 [30].6 
 
Our calculations reveal that ZT-MoSe2 is energetically favorable over T-MoSe2 with an energy 
difference of 0.17 eV/atom.  
The supercells of the vertical heterostructures are so chosen that the lattice mismatch between the 
layers get minimized e.g., Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 consists of 1 x 5 unitcells of Œ±-P stacked vertically over 1 x 
4 unitcells of H-MoSe2 that leads to a minimum lattice mismatch of 3.2 %. The lattice mismatch in 
other heterostructures is calculated as 1.16 %, 6.7 %, 1.08% and 0.98 % for Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2, Œ±-P / 
SO-MoSe2, Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 and Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, respectively. The equilibrium interlayer distance is 
obtained as 3.8 √Ö, 3.6 √Ö, 3.7 √Ö, 3.8 √Ö and 3.5 √Ö for Œ±-P / H-MoSe2, Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2, 
Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 and Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, respectively. Binding energy per atom in these heterostructures is 
calculated to be a few meV (~ 40 meV) which shows weak van der Waals interaction in the considered 
heterostructures. Note that binding energy is obtained  as EB = |E - (E1 - E2)|/N, where E is the total 
energy of the heterostructure,  E1 and E2 are the energies of the isolated individual layers of the 
heterostructures and N is the number of atoms in the heterostructure.  
            3.1 Electronic Structure  
Œ±-P displays a direct band gap of 1.12 eV while Œ≤-P has an indirect band gap, 2.05 eV (Table 1). 
H-MoSe2 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of about 1.13 eV while T-MoSe2, ZT-MoSe2 and 
SO-MoSe2 are zero band gap materials. Note that GGA-PBE band gap underestimates the fundamental 
gap due to approximate nature of exchange-correlation functional. The band gap calculated with 
quasiparticle GW calculations in other reports [31-33] is ‚âà 1.0 eV higher than that of GGA-PBE value 
for monolayer black phosphorene and MoSe2. Therefore, it should be noted that the results presented 
here represent the qualitative picture of electronic band structure. ZT-MoSe2 and SO-MoSe2 have been7 
 
found to exhibit Dirac-cone like feature at the Fermi level which arises due to the 4p orbitals of Se in 
ZT-MoSe2 and 4d-orbitals of Mo in case of SO-MoSe2 (Figure S2 of ESI).  
 We found that Œ±-P/H-MoSe2 and Œ≤-P/H-MoSe2 are semiconductors with a band gap of 0.7 eV and 
1.1 eV, respectively, former exhibit an indirect gap while the later has a direct band gap. In Œ±-P / H-
MoSe2, the valance band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by 3p orbitals of P atoms whereas 
the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly composed of 4d-orbitals of Mo. In case of Œ≤-P / H-
MoSe2, the both VBM and CBM are mainly contributed by the 4d-orbitals of Mo (Figure 2).   On the 
other hand,  rest of the three heterostructures i.e., Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 and Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, 
are found to be zero-gap materials (Figure 2). On comparing the electronic structure of Œ±-P / ZT-
MoSe2, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2  with their monolayer counterparts, the Dirac-cone like feature are found to 
remains intact at the Fermi level while the P-bands shift upward.  In Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, the bands at the 
Fermi level which arises due to T-MoSe2, remains unaltered but the Œ≤-P bands show downward shift 
(Figure 2, Figure S2 of ESI). In all the heterostructures, the majority of the contribution to the total 
density of states around the Fermi level comes from the 4d, 4p and 3p orbitals of Mo, Se and P 
respectively (Figure S3 of ESI). In order to get further insight into the electronic structure, the charge 
density difference profile were obtained, which shows the accumulation of charge in van der Waals‚Äôs 
gap that leads to reduction of energy gap due to interlayer interactions (Figure 2) as compared to higher 
band gap in the constituent semiconducting monolayers. Note that charge density difference is 
calculated as ŒîœÅ = œÅ ‚Äì (œÅ1 - œÅ2), where œÅ is the charge density of the heterostructure, œÅ1 and œÅ2 are the 
charge densities of the isolated monolayers.  
             3.2 Band Alignment:8 
 
We found that p-type phosphorene and n-type H-MoSe2 forms an anti-type heterostructure with 
type I and type II band alignments for Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / H-MoSe2, respectively (Figure 3). The 
type II heterostructures are ideal for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications since the 
free electrons and holes get instinctively separated [22]. There is a small amount of band bending as 
one moves from the region where the phosphorene and MoSe2 layers are stacked to the region where 
only pristine phosphorene is present. Note that band bending is obtained as the difference between the 
work functions of the composed system (W) and the pristine layer (Ws): ŒîEF = W- Ws. The magnitude 
of band bending in Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 is found to be 0.17 eV for Œ±-P and 0.11 eV for H-MoSe2 while its 
magnitude in Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 comes out to be 0.07 eV and 0.43 eV for Œ≤-P and H-MoSe2, respectively.  
Similarly, the values of band bending for phosphorene layer in Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 and 
Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2 are 0.53 eV, 0.60 eV and - 0.62 eV, respectively (Figure 3). Since ŒîEF > 0 for Œ±-P / 
ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2, electrons will be transferred from phosphorene to MoSe2 making it 
as a p-type channel while for Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2 the semiconductor-metal contact is n-type due to negative 
band bending. Note that when two layers with different work functions comes in contact with each 
other, the charges redistribution and bend bending occurs to equalize the work functions between the 
layers. Also in case of vertical heterostructures, the weak interlayer coupling results in the change in 
band positions of the constituent monolayers in heterostructure.    
It is important here to discuss the Schottky Barrier Height (SBH) for the semiconductor- metal 
heterostructures if we consider MoSe2 as a metal contact and phosphorene as the channel material for 
device application. The Schottky barrier in a semiconductor- metal junction is the excitation energy 
of electrons from metal to semiconductor or vice-versa. For p-type semiconductors, the Schottky 
barrier is defined as the difference between the Fermi level and the valance band edge of the 
semiconductor and for n-type materials it is the difference between the conduction band edge of the9 
 
semiconductor and the Fermi level.  In Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 and Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, the SBH 
is calculated as 0 eV, 0 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. Hence, two of the heterostructures namely Œ±-P / 
ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 results in an ohmic contact. Hence, all three of our semiconductor-
metal contacts owning very low Schottky barrier height, if employed for practical applications, can be 
proved to greatly enhance the drive current of the device. The Schottky Barrier is p-type for Œ±-P / ZT-
MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 since the valance band is closer to the Dirac point while it is n-type for Œ≤-
P / T-MoSe2 (Figure 2). 
            3.3 Effect of External Electric Field: 
On applying perpendicular electric field in the range ¬± 1 V/√Ö, the semiconducting heterostructures 
show reduction in band gap, however, change in band gap depends strongly on the polarity of the field 
e.g positive field reduces the bandgap sharply leading to a transition from semiconductor to metal at 
E‚ä• = 0.5 V/√Ö in Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 while negative field firstly increases the band gap to a maximum value 
at E‚ä• = 0.2 V/√Ö and then decreases continuously to minimum (Figure 4).  Similarly, Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 
show asymmetric behavior in band gap variation with respect to the polarity of applied external electric 
field that results into direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. The change in bandgap on the application 
of external electric field is as a result of charge redistribution in van der Waal‚Äôs gap as shown for Œ±-
P/H-MoSe2 in Figure 5. The asymmetric behavior of the bandgap with electric field in case of 
semiconducting heterostructures can be attributed to the counterbalance of external electric field with 
the internal electric field arising due to the difference in electronegativity and structural arrangements 
of the atoms in the two layers of the heterostructure. The evolution of bands as a function of applied 
electric field is given in Figure 5 and Figure S4 of ESI.10 
 
In case of metallic heterostructures, the tuning of Schottky barrier height (SBH) with applied 
electric field can be achieved. Particularly, on the application of positive electric field in Œ±-P / ZT-
MoSe2   and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2, the semiconductor-metal contact remains ohmic but the Dirac cone 
moves energetically below the valence band edge of Œ±-P making the SHB negative while for negative 
fields, the Dirac cone remains at the Fermi level but the Schottky barrier changes from p-type to n-
type (Figure 5 and Figure S4 of ESI). In case of Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2, however, positive field turns the barrier 
from n-type to p-type as the valence band edge of Œ≤-P becomes closer to the Fermi level while negative 
fields of  around  ‚Äì 1.0 V/√Ö reduces the barrier height to zero rendering the given heterostructure to 
possess ohmic contact. Obtaining zero or even very low SBH in device contacts is one of the most-
crucial tasks for realizing high-performance nano-material-based FETs [34, 35].  
The change in electronic structure with applied field can be quantified in terms of charge density 
difference profiles. On the application of positive electric field, an accumulation of electrons occur 
near the MoSe2 layer while the region near phosphorene layer appears to be depleted of charge which 
clearly depicts electron transfer from phosphorene to MoSe2 layer. Similarly, on applying negative 
field, electrons (holes) tend to move from MoSe2 (phosphorene) to phosphorene (MoSe2) (Figure 5). 
            3.4 Mechanical Properties: 
The elastic parameters such as in-plane stiffness and Poisson‚Äôs ratio are used to characterize the 
mechanical response of a two-dimensional material. In-plane stiffness is given by  ùê∂=
1
ùëÜ0 (
ùúï2ùê∏ùë†
ùúïùúñ2 ) where 
S0 is the equilibrium area of the two-dimensional material, Es is the strain energy and œµ is the applied 
strain, whereas the Poisson‚Äôs ratio is defined as ùúà=
‚àíùúñùë°ùëüùëéùëõùë†
ùúñùëéùë•ùëñùëéùëô [36, 37].  A strain ranging from -0.02 to 
0.02 is applied by changing the lattice constant along x and y directions, simultaneously, in steps of 
0.01 to make a data grid of 25 points to calculate the strain energies which were then fitted in  the11 
 
formula ùê∏ùë†= ùëéùúñùë•2 + ùëèùúñùë¶2 + ùëêùúñùë•ùúñùë¶ where ùúñùë• and ùúñùë¶ are strain along x and y directions, respectively. 
Thereafter, the in-plane stiffness and Poisson‚Äôs ratio along x direction is obtained as ùê∂ùë•=

ùëÜ0 (2ùëé‚àí
ùëê2
2ùëè)  ùëéùëõùëë ùúàùë•=

2ùëé.  
In case of hexagonally symmetric systems, a and b are equal in harmonic range. Therefore, the in-
plane stiffness and poisson's ratio of H-MoSe2, T-MoSe2 and blue-P are same along x and y directions. 
Also for the squared symmetric SO-MoSe2, it is same in both the directions. On the other hand, the 
anisotropy in ZT-MoSe2 and black-P structures along x and y directions lead to different in-plane 
stiffness and poisson's ratio along x and y directions (Table 1). A strong bond (i.e., with smaller bond 
length) and higher bond density leads to higher in-plane stiffness. But the average bond lengths along 
x and y directions in all the considered MoSe2 phases is almost the same and also the Mo atoms in all 
the structures are six fold coordinated. Hence the difference in in-plane stiffness of these phases may 
be attributed to the different structural arrangements of Mo-Se units in different phases. SO-MoSe2 
and Œ≤-P are found to be the most and least flexible layers with smallest (~ 46 N/m) and highest (~ 277 
N/m) values of in plane stiffness, respectively. Also, the highest values of Poisson‚Äôs ratio for SO-
MoSe2 (0.63) suggests its ease in expansion without braking. 
The in-plane stiffness and Poisson‚Äôs ratio of the considered heterostructures is also depicted in 
Table 1. In-plane stiffness values of considered heterostructures follow the trend Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 > Œ≤-
P / T-MoSe2 > Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2 > Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 > Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2. Hence, Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 with 
lowest in-plane stiffness and highest poisson‚Äôs ratio among all the heterostructures, may  find 
application in flexible van der Waals device fabrication.  
            3.5 Simulated STM Images:12 
 
 First principles calculations have been well known to simulate the STM images by applying a small 
bias voltage Vbias between the STM tip and the sample [20, 38-40] which yields a tunneling current 
with density j(r) proportional to the local density of states (LDOS) at the centre of the curvature of the 
tip at (r), approximated by the Tersoff and Hamann [41]. The LDOS is integrated from (EF ‚Äì eV) to 
EF and the s-waves with constant density of states describes the tip states. A positive (negative) bias 
voltage indicates tunneling from occupied states of the sample to tip (tip to unoccupied states of the 
sample). WSxM code [42] has been employed hereto obtain the STM images derived from LDOS in 
constant current (CC) mode. STM images of Œ±-P containing heterostructures are simulated at  ¬± 0.5 V 
while for Œ≤-P  based heterostructures images are obtained at higher bias i.e. ¬± 1.5 V due to higher 
energy gap in the constituent monolayer of phosphorene, so as to  get a better understanding of the 
electronic states near the Fermi level. Simulated STM images of the constituent monolayers are clearly 
distinguishable due different atomic arrangement in the given structures (Figure 6). Bright colors in 
all the STM images indicate the atoms nearest to the STM tip i.e., the top most atoms. In case of Œ±-P, 
for forward bias, the electron density is large over the P atoms while for reverse bias the electron 
density is localized over the covalent bonds between the pair of P atoms. This means an antibonding 
character is visible for positive bias while bonding character is visible for negative bias.  In case of Œ≤-
P, under forward as well as reverse bias the contribution to electronic density is only from upper P 
atoms (Figure 6 and Figure S5 of ESI). Similar explanation is applicable for understanding the 
electronic density distribution of other structures as well. 
             On comparing STM images of heterostructures with that of the corresponding monolayers, we 
observe that in addition to possessing the antibonding character of phosphorous in Œ±-P based 
heterostructures, the features of MoSe2 are clearly depicted.  Therefore, Œ±-P can be potentially use as 
a capping layer to differentiate between different allotropes of MoSe2.  On the other hand, no difference13 
 
in STM images was obtained for Œ≤-P based heterostructures (Figure 6 and Figure S5 of ESI), hence Œ≤-
P cannot be used as a capping layer to differentiate between different MoSe2 allotropes.  
 
           3.6 Dielectric Properties: 
 Now we calculate the dielectric response of given heterostructures and their constituent monolayers 
(Figure 7 and Figure S6 of ESI). The dielectric functions are found to be highly anisotropic in low 
energy range and become isotropic in high energy range. The structure peaks in the imaginary part of 
dielectric function (Œµ2) is associated with the interband transitions in the corresponding electronic 
structure. Note that, there are multiple interband transitions due to different band numbers and different 
brillouin zone directions that might corresponds to a particular structure peak in the imaginary part of 
the dielectric function.  For example, Œ±-P and Œ≤-P possess two prominent structure peaks one at ~ 4 
eV corresponding for lateral polarization and the other at ~ 6 eV due to the vertical polarization which 
corresponds to interband transition between the bands separated by ~ 4 eV and ~ 6 eV across the Fermi 
level in corresponding electronic structure which falls in the ultraviolet region (3.2 eV to 12 eV). The 
energy of the structure peaks remain nearly same for the homobilayers as well but the intensity 
increases (Figure S6 of ESI). The higher intensity in case of homobilayers is attributed to the 
availability of increased number of allowed bands for interband transition. In case of heterostructures 
also, the interband transition is found to occur in ultraviolet region and the prominent feature is mainly 
due to phosphorene (Figure 7). 
         The structure peaks in electron energy loss spectra (EELS) depicts the plasmonic excitations. 
Low energy plasmonic structures (œÄ-plasmons) are related to the excitation of weak œÄ-electrons while 
high energy plasmonic features ( œÄ + œÉ plasmons) are associated with both weak œÄ- and strong œÉ-
electrons [43].  For example, Œ±-P exhibits two plasmonic features, one at lower energy < 8 eV and14 
 
other at energy > 8 eV (Figure 7). Note that five valence electrons in phosphorous atom gives rise to 
sp3 hybridization, three of the electrons form covalent bonds with other three atoms while rest of the 
two electrons occupy lone pair. Similarly, other monolayers considered in the study also exhibits two 
types of plasmonic features. EELS of homobilayers case also exhibit two plasmonic peaks which get 
blue shifted with respect to their monolayer counterparts (Figure S6 of ESI).  
       In case of heterostructures, the EELS of Œ±-P / H-MoSe2, Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 
depicts high energy plasmonic feature corresponding to œÄ- and œÉ-electrons while the EELS of Œ≤-P / H-
MoSe2 and Œ≤-P / T-MoSe2 exhibits both high and low energy plasmonic feature (Figure 7). The 
calculated values of static dielectric constant (Œµs) shows highly anisotropic response of given 
monolayers and heterostructures e.g. the value of Œµs for Œ±-P is 3.7 and 2.2 for lateral and vertical 
polarization, respectively, while these are 7.6 and 4.2 for  Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 heterostructure.  The value 
of Œµs  in semiconducting monolayers and heterostructures show inverse trend in comparison with the 
corresponding band gap which can be attributed to the two band relationship ÔÅ•ùë† ÔÇª 1 + (
‚ÑéœâP
ùê∏g )
2
between 
the bandgap ùê∏g of the semiconductors and ÔÅ•ùë†, proposed by Penn [44], where œâP is the plasmonic 
frequency. Higher value of static dielectric constant  represent the characteristics of metal [Table 1]. . 
The variable dielectric response of given heterostructures make them useful for tunable optoelectronic 
applications.  
 
4. Summary: 
In summary, first principles calculations have been employed to investigate various properties 
of phosphorene/MoSe2 heterostructures. The commensurate phosphorene based heterostructures are 
found to be semiconducting and metallic in nature. Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 are found to 
form ohmic contacts whereas  Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2 exhibit metallic features. External electric field induces15 
 
semiconductor-to-metal transition in Œ±-P / H-MoSe2 while direct-to-indirect bandgap transition occurs 
in Œ≤-P / H-MoSe2. In case of Œ±-P / ZT-MoSe2 and Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2, the positive field makes the 
schottky barrier height negative while negative field changes the barrier from p-type to n-type. In Œ≤-P 
/ T-MoSe2, positive field change the barrier from n-type to p-type while negative field changes the 
contact to ohmic. Mechanical response of given heterostructures reveal that Œ±-P / SO-MoSe2 can be 
potentially use as a material for flexible nanoelectronics. Simulated STM images of given 
heterostructures depict that Œ±-P can be used as a capping layer to distinguish various allotropes of 
MoSe2 . The dielectric response of considered heterostructures is found to be highly anisotropic.  Our 
results demonstrate that considered structures have great potential to be used as novel materials for 
nano-electronic device applications based on van der Waal heterostructures.
