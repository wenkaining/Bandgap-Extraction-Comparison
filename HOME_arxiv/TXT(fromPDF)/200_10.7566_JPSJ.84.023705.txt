We report the emergence of bulk superconductivity in Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0 below
0.68 and 0.36 K, respectively. This is the ﬁrst observation of superconductivity in Tsai-type crystalline
approximants of quasicrystals. The Tsai-type cluster center is occupied by Au and Ge ions in the former
approximant, and by an Yb ion in the latter. For magnetism, the latter system shows a larger magnetization
than the former. To explain this observation, we propose a model that the cluster-center Yb ion is magnetic.
The relationship between the magnetism and the superconductivity is also discussed.
Quasicrystals (QCs) have been classiﬁed as the third
solid because they possess long-range, quasi-periodic
structures with diﬀraction symmetries forbidden for crys-
tals. Owing to the considerable progress since the discov-
ery of QCs in resolving their geometric structure,1–3 QCs
are nowadays considered as a type of crystal. For their
electronic structure, on the other hand, no long-range
magnetic ordering has been observed although there are
a few reports on superconductivity.4, 5 For a periodic ap-
proximant crystal (AC), a phase whose composition is
close to that of the QC and whose unit cell has atomic
decorations similar to those of the QC, there are some
reports on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic orderings.
However, superconductivity has not been discovered thus
far to the best of our knowledge.
Recently, new types of magnetic QC and AC has
been discovered: the Au-Al-Yb (AAY) QC exhibits
novel quantum critical behavior as observed in Yb-based
heavy-fermion materials with intermediate Yb valence,6
while the AAY AC shows heavy-Fermi-liquid behavior.
Since the diverging behavior of magnetic susceptibility as
T →0 was only observed in the QC, the quantum crit-
ical state may correspond to an electronic state unique
to the QCs, i.e., a critical state that is neither extended
nor localized.
In the course of our research on the above novel phe-
nomena, we learned from our review of the literature that
the Au-Ge-Yb (AGY) system belongs to the 1/1 AC of
a Tsai-type icosahedral QC. According to Lin and Cor-
bett,7 the AGY system has two types of crystal structure:
one contains 14 at% Yb and the other 16 at% Yb atoms.
Almost four non-Yb (i.e., Au and Ge) atoms occupy the
center of the Tsai-type cluster in the former compound
as in the case of AAY,8 while, in the latter one, there is
only a “rattling” Yb atom at the center of the cluster.9

Hereafter, the former and latter ACs are referred to as
AGY(I) and AGY(II), respectively.
In this Letter, we report on our low-temperature ex-
periments on the electrical resistivity, magnetization, ac
magnetic susceptibility, and speciﬁc heat of the AGY(I)
and AGY(II) ACs. We observe that both of the ACs
show superconductivity with transition temperatures Tc
of 0.68 K for AGY(I) and 0.36 K for AGY(II). We fur-
ther observe that the magnetization is much larger in the
AGY(II) AC than in the AGY(I) AC. To explain this ob-
servation, we propose a model in which the cluster-center
Yb ion in AGY(II) is magnetic. We also discuss the re-
lationship between magnetism and superconductivity in
these new systems.
Two types of polycrystalline sample, Au86−xGexYb14
(20 ≤x ≤24) and Au84−yGeyYb16 (18 ≤y ≤22),
were synthesized with the starting materials 4N (99.99%
pure)-Au, 5N-Ge, and 3N-Yb. (Note that the composi-
tion is nominal throughout the paper.) For both alloys,
the starting materials were put in an alumina crucible,
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated to 1000
◦C. Then, the crucible was cooled to 800 ◦C. After it was
subsequently cooled slowly to 450 ◦C, the crucible was
rapidly quenched in water for the synthesis of AGY(I),
while it was slowly cooled in the furnace for the synthesis
of AGY(II).
Structure analysis was carried out by a powder X-ray
diﬀraction technique using Cu Kα-radiation; details of
the experiments are described elsewhere.8 The dc magne-
tization was measured using a commercial SQUID mag-
netometer in the temperature range between 1.8 and 300
K, and at magnetic ﬁelds of up to 70 kOe. Four-terminal
resistivity measurements were performed using ac meth-
ods. Ac magnetic susceptibility was measured using a
driving ac magnetic ﬁeld of 0.1 Oe at a frequency of 100.3
Hz. The speciﬁc heat measurement was performed by

a conventional quasi-adiabatic heat-pulse method. The
electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and spe-
ciﬁc heat measurements with zero dc magnetic ﬁeld were
carried out in a 3He cryostat down to 0.25 K, and the
resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements
at magnetic ﬁelds of up to 80 kOe were carried out in a
dilution refrigerator down to 0.08 K.
Figure 1 shows the powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns
of Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0, both of
which show a body-centered cubic structure with lattice
parameters of 1.4724(2) and 1.4605(4) nm, respectively.
Note that the alloy with a higher Yb concentration has
a smaller lattice parameter, as pointed out in Ref. 7.
The Rietveld structure analysis of the former suc-
cessfully converged and indicated that the sample with
an optimal composition x = 64.0 is of single phase
and its cluster-center tetrahedron is orientationally dis-
ordered.10 For the latter, on the other hand, the pre-
dominant phase has an optimal composition of y = 63.5
and the sample contains a small amount of an uniden-
tiﬁed phase. The inclusion of the secondary phase pre-
vented the complete Rietveld reﬁnement. In the present
study, we assume following Lin and Corbett that, there
is a single Yb atom at the cluster center in the lat-
ter system.7, 9 As a result, AGY(I) and AGY(II) denote
Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0 and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0, respectively.
Figure 2 shows two structure models, both of which are
composed of the Tsai-type cluster, i.e., concentric shells
of a dodecahedron, an icosahedron, and an icosidodec-
ahedron. Note that the “Yb1” site at the vertex of the
icosahedron is exclusively occupied by the Yb atom. The
structure model of the AGY(I) AC is similar to that of
the AAY AC; the cluster center is occupied by Au atoms
with a probability of approximately 0.27 (Ref. 10), which
is close to 1/3 in the case of a randomly oriented tetrahe-
dron. In contrast, in the structure model of the AGY(II)
AC, the cluster center is occupied by a single Yb atom
(“Yb2” site).
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependences of the
magnetic susceptibilities of the AGY(I) and AGY(II)
ACs. For comparison, we also plot the susceptibility data
of the AAY AC.6 For the analysis described below, the
magnetic susceptibilities of AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs
are plotted in unit per cluster (see the left vertical axis),
including 12 and 13 Yb atoms, respectively, while that of
the AAY AC is given in unit per Yb ion (the right vertical
axis). The AGY(I) AC shows an almost T -independent
diamagnetic susceptibility χ = −1.6 × 10−4 emu/mol-
cluster at high temperatures, and shows a Curie-like rise
in χ(T ) in the lowest-temperature region measured. The
latter rise seems extrinsic because the low-temperature
magnetization M(H) saturates at a low magnetic ﬁeld;
as shown in Fig. 3(b), M(H) is only 9.6×10−3µB/cluster
at H = 50 kOe. It is reasonable to assume that the
T -constant diamagnetism arises as a result of the can-
cellation between the paramagnetic contribution of con-
duction electrons and the diamagnetic contribution of
ion cores. Since the latter susceptibility is estimated
to be ∼−1.8 × 10−3 emu/mol-cluster from the ion
core susceptibility given in the literature,11 the Pauli
susceptibility is evaluated as ∼1.6 × 10−3 emu/mol-
cluster. Using a measured electronic-speciﬁc-heat coef-
ﬁcient γ = 109 mJ/K2mol-cluster, we obtain a Wilson
ratio RW = π2k2
Bχ/3µ2
Bγ ∼1, which is expected for a
noncorrelated electron system. As a result, the observed
magnetism of the AGY(I) AC can be understood by as-
suming that all the Yb ions (i.e., the Yb1-site ions at the
vertex of the icosahedron) are in the nonmagnetic Yb2+
state.12
In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility of the AGY(II)
AC (containing both the Yb1- and Yb2-site ions) be-
haves like that of the AAY AC. Assuming that χ(T ) =
χ0 + χ4f(T ) [χ0 and χ4f(T ) are T -independent and
T -dependent contributions to the susceptibility, respec-
tively], we ﬁnd that, for T
> 80 K, χ4f(T ) follows
the Curie-Weiss law with an eﬀective Bohr magneton
µeﬀ= 3.5µB/cluster and a Weiss temperature Tθ = 104
K. Note that this eﬀective magnetic moment per cluster
is close to 3.8 µB/Yb of the AAY AC. Since the constant
term χ0 = 4.8 × 10−3 emu/mol-cluster is also considered
as additive contributions of conduction electrons and ion
cores, the Pauli paramagnetism of the AGY(II) AC is
estimated to be ∼6.8 × 10−3 emu/mol-cluster from the
ion core diamagnetism of ∼−2.0×10−3 emu/mol-cluster.
Assuming γ ∼251 mJ/K2mol-cluster at high tempera-
tures, we obtain a Wilson ratio RW ∼2, which suggests
the possibility that the 4f electrons would contribute to
the itinerant electron magnetism.

Let us make a comparison between the AGY(II) AC
and the AAY AC. The solid line in Fig. 3(a) indicates
that χ4f(T ) = aχAAY(T ), where a is an adjustable pa-
rameter and found to be 0.9 and χAAY(T ) is a measured
susceptibility (per mole of Yb ion) of the AAY AC. We
ﬁnd good coincidence between the solid curve and the
data points, suggesting that Yb ions in the AGY(II) AC
are similar in nature to those in the AAY AC.
Figure 3(b) shows the magnetization curves for the
AGY(I), AGY(II), and AAY ACs. We ascribe the small
magnetization of the AGY(I) AC to a paramagnetic
impurity eﬀect. The solid line indicates that M(H) =
χ0H + M4f(H), where M4f(H) = aMAAY(H) [a = 0.9
and MAAY(H) is a measured magnetization of the AAY
AC per Yb ion]. Again, we ﬁnd good agreement between
the solid curve and the data points. Taking account of the
results (i) that the magnetization per cluster (containing
12 Yb1-site ions and 1 Yb2-site ion) in the AGY(II) AC
is similar in magnitude to that per Yb ion in the AAY
AC and (ii) that 12 Yb1-site ions are all nonmagnetic in
the AGY(I) AC, we propose a model showing that, in
the AGY(II) AC, the Yb1-site Yb ions are all nonmag-
netic and the Yb2-site Yb ion behaves like the Yb ions
in the AAY AC. This implies that the AGY(II) AC has
a heterogeneous Yb valence.
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependences of the
electrical resistivities ρ(T ) of the AGY(I) and AGY(II)
ACs. The T -independent feature with a large residual re-
sistivity [see inset of Fig. 4(a)] is characteristic of ACs
as well as QCs with Tsai-type clusters. The electrical
resistivities of both materials sharply drop to zero, indi-
cating the emergence of superconductivity. By deﬁning
the transition temperature Tc as the midpoint of the re-
sistivity drop, we obtain Tc = 0.68 and 0.36 K for the
AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, respectively.
Figure 4(b) shows the temperature dependences of the
real parts of the ac magnetic susceptibilities χ′(T ) of the
AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs with zero external dc mag-
netic ﬁeld. Below Tc, there emerges a clear diamagnetic
signal due to the superconducting shielding eﬀect. When
deﬁning Tc as the onset of diamagnetism, we ﬁnd that the
Tc values deduced from the susceptibility and resistivity
coincide with each other.
Detailed studies of the ﬁeld-dependent resistivity and
ac susceptibility allow us to determine the upper crit-
ical ﬁeld Hc2(T ); see the inset of Fig. 4(b). Just be-
low Tc, we observe a linear T dependence with gradi-
ents of dHc2/dT = 5.84 and 6.75 kOe/K for the AGY(I)
and AGY(II) ACs, respectively. The orbital critical ﬁeld
at zero temperature is estimated using this slope via
the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula Horb
c2 (0) =
−0.693TcdHc2/dT , and the results are summarized in
Table I, together with the Hc2(0) values obtained by ex-
trapolating the data to zero temperature. We ﬁnd that
Horb
c2 (0) is close to Hc2(0) for both materials, suggesting
that the orbital depairing mechanism dominantly con-
tributes to the Hc2 of these ACs.
To check if the superconductivity is of bulk origin, we
measured the speciﬁc heat C(T ). In the normal state,
C(T ) can be well ﬁtted using the conventional formula
C(T ) = γT + βT 3 (2 < T < 5 K) with γ = 109 and 251
mJ/K2mol-cluster, and β = 40.8 and 41.1 mJ/K4mol-
cluster for the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, respectively.

perature to be ΘD = 160 and 157 K for the AGY(I)
and AGY(II) ACs, respectively. Then, by subtracting the
phonon contribution of C(T ), we evaluate the electronic
speciﬁc heat Ce(T ). In Fig. 4(c), we plot Ce/T as a func-
tion of temperature. A clear jump is observed at Tc: the
thin solid line indicates the T dependence calculated us-
ing entropy balance. The jump height is ∆Ce/Tc = 138
and 218 mJ/K2mol-cluster and therefore ∆Ce/Ce(Tc) is
1.26 and 0.54 for the AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs, respec-
tively. These values indicate the bulk superconductivity
and suggest that, if the 4f electrons would be itinerant,
then they are involved in Cooper pair formation.
In the normal state, the AGY(II) AC shows a loga-
rithmic increase in Ce/T at low temperatures in con-
trast to the AGY(I) AC: the solid line in Fig. 4(c)
indicates a ﬁtted result using the expression Ce/T ∼

the possibility of an unconventional pairing mechanism
related to the magnetism.

sume that κ(0) ≃κ from Hc2(0) ≃Horb

the large κ values exceeding 20 indicate that both mate-
rials are type II superconductors. The coherence length
ξ(0) is estimated from Hc2(0) = Φ0/2πξ(0)2, where Φ0
is a ﬂux quantum. The penetration depth is estimated
from the relation λ(0) = κ(0)ξ(0). The thermodynamic
critical ﬁeld is evaluated from Hc(0) = Hc2(0)/
√
2κ(0).
Finally, the lower critical ﬁeld is estimated using the for-
mula Hc1(0)Hc2(0) = Hc(0)2(lnκ(0) + 0.08). As seen in
Table I, we ﬁnd no clear diﬀerence in the superconducting
parameter, ξ(0), λ(0), or κ(0) for the AGY(I) or AGY(II)
AC.
We consider two possibilities for the relationship be-
tween magnetism and superconductivity: (i) The super-
conductivity mechanisms are diﬀerent between AGY(I)
and AGY(II), and the magnetism stabilizes the super-
conductivity for the latter. (ii) The superconductivity
mechanism is common between them and the magnetism
destabilizes the superconductivity for the latter. At the
present stage, it is unclear which of those possibilities is
probable: we need further investigations.
In

two
Tsai-type
1/1
ACs with a nominal composition, Au64.0Ge22.0Yb14.0
[AGY(I)] and Au63.5Ge20.5Yb16.0[AGY(II)]. By low-
temperature experiments on their electrical resistivity,
magnetization, ac magnetic susceptibility, and speciﬁc
heat, we showed that they are the ﬁrst superconductors
among Tsai-type QCs and ACs. To account for the dif-
ferent magnetic properties of AGY(I) and AGY(II) ACs,
we proposed a model in which Yb ion located at the Tsai-
type cluster center, which exists only in the AGY(II) AC,
is magnetic while the other Yb ions located at the ver-
tex of the icosahedron are nonmagnetic. We further dis-
cussed the possible eﬀect of the cluster-center magnetic
Yb ion on superconductivity. We hope that the present
study stimulates further search for superconducting QC
and AC, and research on the relationship between mag-
netism and superconductivity as well.
