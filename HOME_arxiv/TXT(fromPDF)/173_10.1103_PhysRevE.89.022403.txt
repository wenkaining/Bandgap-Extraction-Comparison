Matallic alloys, such as Al or Cu, or mild steel, display plastic instabilities in a well deﬁned range
of temperatures and deformation rates, a phenomenon known as the Portevin-Le Chatelelier (PLC)
eﬀect. The stick-slip behavior, or serration, typical of this eﬀect is due to the discontinuous motion
of dislocations as they interact with solute atoms. Here we study a simple model of interacting
dislocations and show how the classical Einstein ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation can be used to
deﬁne the temperature in a range of model parameters and to construct a phase diagram of serration
that can be compared to experimental results. Furthermore, performing analytical calculations and
numerically integrating the equations of motion, we clarify the crucial role played by dislocation
mutual interactions in serration.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Dislocation dynamics is a complex intermittent phenomenon involving the collective motion of many dislocations
interacting between each other as well with obstacles eventually present in the material, like solute atoms or quenched
dislocations from other glide planes [1–3]. The long range stress produced by dislocations may lead to jamming and
avalanche-like phenomena even in the absence of obstacles [4]. The presence of obstacles changes the local properties
of the host material, resulting in a pinning force on nearby dislocations [5, 6]. Usually, this source of disorder for
dislocations is taken to be quenched, so that its properties do not change within the relevant timescales of the system
[7]. However, under speciﬁc conditions, the mobility of solute atoms in metallic alloys [8, 9], or oxygen vacancies in
superconductors [10], plays an important role in the dynamics of these systems.
Here we are interested in studying the dynamics of interacting dislocations mediated by mobile impurities. The
interplay between dislocations mutual interactions and pinning by mobile impurities is believed to be at the origin
of plastic instabilities observed in metallic alloys under suitable loading conditions and temperature. One of the
best studied forms of instability propagation is the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) eﬀect [11]. When a specimen of a
dilute alloy (such as Al or Cu alloy, or mild steel) is strained in uniaxial loading, the mechanical response is often
discontinuous. In constant applied strain rate tests, the stress versus strain (or time, which is proportional to strain)
curves exhibit a succession of stress drops and reloading sequences (serration).
From a dynamical point of view, the jerky or stick-slip behavior of stress is related to the discontinuous motion of
dislocations, namely, the pinning (stick) and unpinning (slip) of dislocations. The classical explanation of the PLC
eﬀect is via the dynamic strain aging (DSA) concept [12]. It is based on the interplay between the diﬀusivity of solute
atoms and dislocations that can be arrested temporarily at obstacles during their waiting time. Thus, the longer the
dislocations are arrested, the larger will be the stress required to unpin them. As a result, when the contribution from
aging is large enough, the critical stress to move a dislocation increases with increasing waiting time or decreasing
imposed strain rate. When these dislocations are unpinned, they move at large speed until they are arrested again.
At high strain rates (or low temperatures), the time available for solute atoms to diﬀuse towards the dislocations in
order to age them decreases and hence the stress required to unpin them decreases. Thus, in a range of strain rates
and temperatures where these two time scales are of the same order of magnitude, the PLC instability manifests. The
competition between the slow rate of aging and sudden unpinning of the dislocations, translates at the macroscopic
level, into a negative strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of the ﬂow stress as a function of strain rate. This basic instability
mechanism, used in most phenomenological models for the PLC eﬀect [13], is based on the behavior of individual
dislocation and thus does not explain how dislocation motion can synchronize to yield macroscopic strain bursts.
Current theoretical approaches to models the PLC eﬀect are based on a mesoscopic descriptive level (where coarse
grained dislocation density is considered) in which phenomenological parameters are needed to construct the relative
dynamical equations [13]. Modeling plastic deformation phenomena taking into account inhomogeneity at the dislo-
cation level oﬀers fundamental advantages compared to continuum mechanics approaches. The discrete dislocation
dynamical (DDD) approaches allow, for example, to account for the intrinsic length scales, such as the grain size,
the mesh length of a dislocation network or the cross-slip height, which is necessary to understand the formation of
spatial dislocation structures, as persistent slip bands [14], and plastic instabilities, as L¨uders band and the PLC eﬀect2
[13]. The problem of spatial and temporal coupling in heterogeneously deforming materials, and the associated length
and time scales to be included in constitutive laws, is a central issue in current attempts to bridge a gap between
dislocation based constitutive models and continuum mechanics.
The general three-dimensional dynamical problem of dislocation lines interacting among each other is a complex
problem due to the necessity to consider ﬂexible lines conserving their connectivity and line length and take care
of line interactions [15–21].
In several instances, however, dislocations are arranged into regular structures that
are amenable to analytical treatment and more eﬃcient simulation approach.
Here we analyze the dynamics of
the eﬀective one-dimensional dislocation array called pileup interacting with mobile impurities.
A slip band can
be envisaged as a queue of dislocations, a pileup, pushed through a series of obstacles (solute atoms or immobile
dislocations from other glide planes). In our case the obstacles perform a diﬀusive motion due to thermal eﬀects,
and interact with dislocations. This system can be viewed as a coupled one-dimensional channels of particles [22], in
which particles in one channel (dislocations) are driven by an external force and experience a drag from the undriven
particles (impurities) in the other channel. In the following we discuss before the single dislocation in a cloud of
mobile impurities problem, analyzed in Ref.[23], and then we propose a generalization of the equations in the case of
many interacting dislocations in a landscape of mobile impurities.
II.
SINGLE DISLOCATION INTERACTING WITH MOBILE IMPURITIES
Recently the dynamics of a particle interacting with diﬀusing impurities in one dimension has been investigated by
Laurson and Alava [23]. Despite the simplicity of the model, that makes it analytically tractable, it exhibits a rich
dynamics. Here we describe this model as an introduction to the following section in which we will generalize the
relative equations to the case of many interacting dislocations.
In the full formulation of the model discussed in Ref.[23], a particle in a cloud composed by a ﬁxed number of Np
impurities driven by an external force F is considered. The force is given by F = k(V t −x), where V is the driving
velocity and k is a spring constant characterizing the response of the driving mechanism. The region of the parameter
space is restricted to that in which the impurities have a vanishingly small probability to escape from the vicinity
of the particle within the timescale of the simulation. Thus, the particle is dragging an impurity cloud with a ﬁxed
number of impurity particles without escaping from it. The equations of motion are
µ∂x
∂t
= PNp
i=1 f(x −xs,i) + F,
∂xs,i
∂t
= −f(x −xs,i) + ηi,
(1)
where x and xs are the position of the particle and the impurity particles, respectively. f(z) is the interaction force
between the particle and the impurity particle, µ deﬁnes the relative mobility of the impurity and the particle and ηi
are Gaussian white noise with standard deviation δη and zero mean. The only condition imposed on the expression
of the force f(z) if ∂zf(z)|z=0 = −f0. Here we are interested in particular on the behavior of the external force F,
that in experiments represents the shear stress acting on dislocations. For z = x −xs close to zero, the following
expression for the stochastic process ∂tF is derived in Ref. [23]

Now, assuming that in the stationary state the last term in the r.h.s. of Eq.2 has zero mean (⟨V (Np + µ) −F⟩= 0)
and that ﬂuctuations are small compared to those of the white noise term (δF ≪

the following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for ∂tF

The condition of small ﬂuctuations δF ≪
p
Npδη is fulﬁlled for most of the relevant parameter values condition; only
for kf0 ≫1 this is not the case. From Eq. 3 is possible to see that, after an initial transient, the system reaches the
stationary state in which the external force F ﬂuctuates around a constant average value and these ﬂuctuations are
uncorrelated in time [23]. Therefore, the system composed by a single dislocation in a cloud of mobile impurities does
not display a serration type behavior.3
The Eq. 2 can be solved exactly, without imposing conditions on ﬂuctuations. Indeed is possible to rewrite it as a
two dimensional (2d) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Introducing the new variable F ∗= F −V (Np +µ) and considering
F ∗and
˙F ∗as the components of a 2d vector, the Eq. 2 can be written as a 2d Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [24] for

where λ1,2 are the eigenvalues of γ. The only case in which we can have ﬂuctuations in the average force is obtained
for (γ2 −4ω2

In this case oscillations (serration) emerges, but they decays exponentially fast. On the other hand, performing the
stationary limit, one ﬁnds

(11)
Therefore, for any parameter values condition, a serration type behavior is not observed in the single dislocation in
a cloud of mobile impurities model.
III.
DISLOCATION PILEUP INTERACTING WITH MOBILE IMPURITIES
As the PLC eﬀect is widely believed to be due to the dynamic interaction of dislocations with diﬀusing solute atoms,
a natural formulation of the problem, in the framework of DDD approach, is to consider Eq. 1 for N dislocations4
in a landscape of Np mobile impurities. To describe the dynamics of dislocations we use, as in [23], an overdamped
equation, so that the velocity of a dislocation depends linearly on the resolved shear stress exerted on it [25]. Therefore,
the equations of motion Eq. 1 are generalized as follows

where G is the shear modulus, bi is the Burgers vector of the dislocation i, µ and χ are the damping constant of

(13)
while for the pinning force fP (z), with z = xi −xs,j, and the noise term ηj we have the expressions
fP (z) = −f0
z
ξP e−(z/ξP )2,
⟨ηj(t)⟩= 0,
⟨ηj(t)ηj(t′)⟩= Dδ(t −t′)δij.
(14)
To emulate the behavior of a material in the bulk, we consider that N point dislocations and Np impurities move
along a line of size L where periodic boundary conditions are chosen. In order to correctly take into account the eﬀect
of periodic boundary conditions, the interactions between dislocations are summed over theirs images [26].
We are interested in the total average stress exerted on dislocations, σ = 1/N PN
i=1 σl
i (i.e. the external stress that
is needed to apply on the material to obtain a constant strain rate). In view to study the behavior of the stress σ
in relation with the PLC eﬀect, that is regulated principally by the temperature and strain rate as discussed in the
introduction, we have imposed the relations bi = b = 1, G = µ = ξP = 1, f0 = 0.01 and k = 0.1 that ﬁxes the time,
space and force scales. The free parameters of the model are now V, χ, D. In real materials impurities have already
exerted aging eﬀects over dislocations before the experiments (i. e. before that an external stress is imposed on the
material). To take into account this eﬀect the system is leaved to evolve without external stress (k = 0) for a waiting
time tw. The initial conﬁguration of the system (at time t = 0) consists of random distribution of dislocations and
pinning centers. We choose tw = 106 · dt = 104, where the integration step is dt = 10−2. This value of tw is suﬃcient
for the system to stabilize its elastic energy during the initial part of the dynamics (for t < tw and k = 0) [1].
IV.
THE CONDITIONS FOR SERRATION
Before integrating numerically Eqs.12, 13, 14, we can obtain a set of necessary conditions for serration. First of all
we can observe that if dislocations do not interact with any pinning center (fP (z) = 0), the ﬁrst equation of Eq.12
do not posses normal modes of oscillation. This can be found employing a linear perturbative approach, as made in
Ref.[27] to study the discrete cosmological N-body problem, or observing that the ﬁrst equation of Eq.12 describes
the so called Coulomb gas for the variables xi −(V/b)t at zero temperature [28].
If we now consider that dislocations interact with pinning centers (fP (z) ̸= 0), but with the last ones quenched
(that means dxs,j/dt = 0), from Eqs.12, 13, 14 we obtain
µdx

fP (xi −xs,j)
xs,j = cj
=⇒
∂tσ = kV −kb2
µ σ + Γ(t, σl
i, cj)
(15)
where cj are constants and the function Γ can be obtained using the relation between xi and σl
i in Eq. 13. Performing
the ensemble average and the time integral on the relation to the right in Eq. 15, we obtain that ⟨σ⟩= µV/b2 (so5
we do not have serration) if ⟨Γ⟩= 0, that is if the constants cj do not correlate the variables σl
i between them (i.e.
if the cj do not depend in a speciﬁc way on the position of the variables xi(0)). To ﬁnd this result we employed
the relation PN
i=1(i̸=j)
PN
j=1 1/(xi −xj) = 0, introduced the variable x = 1/N PN
i=1 xi and considered the ensemble
average respect to the {cj} conﬁgurations.
Another necessary condition to have serration can be found observing that in the range of parameters for which
the impurities have a vanishingly small probability to escape from dislocations (the same case studied in Ref.[23]
for the single dislocation problem) we can approximate the expression of the interacting force f(z) for small z as
fP (z) ≃fP (0) + z∂zfP (z)|z=0 = −f0z.
Employing this approximation, from Eqs.12, 13, 14, we ﬁnd for σ the

PN

In the end, from Eqs.12, 13, 14 we have found four necessary conditions to have serration: i) ﬁrst of all, the system
must be composed by more than one dislocation (as found in Ref.[23] in the low noise limit, and as results in the general
case from Eq.11). In other words, serration in the stress response of the system, when present, comes from a collective
eﬀect of many interacting dislocations. To verify this, we studied the role of the interaction force between dislocations
analysing the average stress ⟨σ⟩as a function of time (or strain) for diﬀerent values of the interaction force itself
(obtained changing the value of the shear modulus G), for parameter values in which serration is observed (µ/χ = 0.5,
1/T = 104, see the deﬁnition of T below, and V = 0.003). In Fig.1 we displayed the average stress ⟨σ⟩(performed
on 50 samples) as a function of time obtained integrating numerically Eqs.12,13. From it we can see that serration
disappears when the strength of the interaction force between dislocations decreases. In particular, for vanishing
interaction force (G = 0), the stationary average stress is given by the expression: ⟨σ⟩s = V [(Np/N)χ + µ] ≃0.051,
as discussed in the following analysis of Fig.2; ii) dislocations must interact with pinning centers; iii) pinning centers
must not be all quenched (see Eq.15); iv) dislocations must not be all pinned by impurities (see Eq.16).
These
conditions are all in agreement with the DSA concept.
FIG. 1: Average stress ⟨σ⟩(performed on 50 samples) as a function of time obtained integrating numerically Eqs.12,13. The
parameters of the system (µ/χ = 0.5, 1/T = 104, and V = 0.003) are chosen in the range in which serration is observed in
order to investigate the role of the interaction force between dislocations changing the value of the shear modulus G. From it
we can see that serration disappear when the strength of the interaction force between dislocations decreases.
In order to verify the previous four necessary conditions to have serration, and to investigate the behavior of the6
system in the entire free parameter space (V, χ, D), we integrated numerically Eqs.12,13. We considered N = 32
dislocations with an average spacing d = 16 and average pinning center spacing dp = L/Np = 2. Because of L = dN,
is Np = dN/dp = 8N. Instead of using the set of parameters (V, χ, D), we employed this other (V, µ/χ, 1/T ) where
T is the temperature of the system deﬁned in the following. Although we choose, without less of generality, µ = 1
we prefer to keep explicitly the ratio µ/χ. From the other hand, the explicit introduction of the temperature variable
permits to compare the phase diagram of PLC eﬀect (in Fig. 3) with results from literature [29]. The deﬁnition
of temperature is not something obvious in DDD models. Here we introduce the temperature T of the system as
obtained from the Einstein ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation: T = 2D/χ. One diﬃculty in deriving a general theory of
plasticity is due to the presence of thermal as well as athermal dislocation activated processes [13]. For this reason
is still lacking a clear deﬁnition of temperature in DDD models. The simple one we use here can be considered a
good deﬁnition for high temperatures and low stresses in which cases diﬀusional deformation mechanisms become
predominant [1]. In other regimes in which this deﬁnition of T is not a good approximation, we will discuss how it is
related to the behavior of the system.
In Fig. 2 the average stress ⟨σ⟩, obtained integrating numerically Eqs. 12,13, as a function of time t −tw is
graphicated for driving velocity V = 0.001, 0.003, mobility ratio µ/χ = 0, 0.5, 1 and inverse temperature 1/T →∞,
1/T = 104, 2 · 103, 4 · 102. The average ⟨·⟩is performed on 50 samples. In the analysis of Fig. 2 we distinguish two
cases, the ﬁrst one for µ/χ = 0 and the second one for µ/χ > 0. The case µ/χ = 0 corresponds to quenched pinning
centers (dxs,j/dt = 0, see Eq. 15). From Fig. 2a,b we see that for µ/χ = 0, the average stress, after oscillations
decreasing in time, reach the stationary value ⟨σ⟩s = limt→∞⟨σ⟩= V µ.
In the case of µ/χ > 0 we expect that at low temperatures and low driving velocity, or at low temperatures and high
driving velocity, but high values of mobility ratio, dislocations are pinned by impurities. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 2c,e,f
from which we can see that the stationary value of the average stress is given by the relation ⟨σ⟩s = V [(Np/N)χ + µ],
as can be obtained from Eq. 16. To understand the role of dislocation interaction when they are pinned during the
whole dynamics, we can consider the Eq. 11 obtained for the dynamics of a single dislocation generalized to the case in
which the damping constant of each impurity is χ. Therefore the expression of the stationary external force becomes:
limt→∞⟨F⟩= V (Npχ + µ), in which Np is the number of impurities around the only present dislocation. In the case
of N dislocations pinned by Np impurities during the whole dynamics, we have that on average each dislocation i
is pinned by Np/N impurities (considering that the initial spatial distribution of dislocations and pinning centers is
a random ﬂat ones). If we now suppose that in these conditions (obstacles that cannot unpin from dislocations),
dislocations do not ﬂuctuate too much around theirs equilibrium positions (that is a conﬁguration of equidistant
dislocations), we can conclude that the average stationary stress can be obtained from the formula for the single
dislocation pinned by NP /N obstacles case. This means: ⟨σ⟩s = ⟨F(Np →Np/N)⟩s that can be veriﬁed employing
the previous generalized version of Eq. 11. When T or V increases, the number of impurities that pin dislocations
decreases, so ⟨σ⟩s decreases.
From Fig. 2 we can see that stationary ﬂuctuations in the stress (serration) emerge for the values parameter
V = 0.003, µ/χ = 0.5 and 1/T = 104. In Fig. 2 results for driving velocities higher than V = 0.003 and temperatures
T smaller than 10−4 are not reported because in these regimes we reach the limit of our model that continue to
give serration in the stationary average stress, while in real systems we should not have serration [13, 29]. Negative
values of stress ﬂuctuations at earliest times correspond to a sudden increases in the dislocations average position (see
Eq. 13) that happens when dislocations escape from many pinning centers. Indeed, when it happens, we can observe
this eﬀect at earliest times of the dynamics (for t > tw), because the absence of the external stress for 0 < t < tw
permits to dislocations to accumulate pinning centers.
In order to summarise the results obtained from the present model and to compare them with experimental [29]
and others theoretical approache [13], we depicted in Fig. 3, relying on data displayed in Fig. 2 and others data
not displayed there, a phase diagram for the PLC eﬀect in the parameter space (1/T, V ) for µ/χ = 0.5. In the
range of parameters inside the grey region, the PLC eﬀect takes place. The dashed red lines indicate where the
model described by Eqs. 12,13 start to fail in predicting the PLC eﬀect. In particular, for high driving velocities
new dislocation mechanisms, as dislocation multiplication, climbing and others complex behaviors, must be taken
into account. Considering these mechanisms, serration must disappear for high driving velocities irrespective of the
other parameter values. While in the case of small temperatures, non thermal dislocation processes become relevant
in relation to the thermal ones, and the Einstein ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation do not holds anymore. Also in this
case, considering the presence of non thermal dislocation processes, serration must disappear for small temperatures
irrespective of the other parameter values.7

V.
THE RELEVANT TIME SCALES IN SERRATION
The behavior of the system described by Eqs. 12,13,14 can be analyzed in terms of time scales. The fundamental
time scales are: i) the capturing time tc that accounts for the average time needed for a dislocation to capture a
pinning center; ii) the aging time ta that accounts for the average time needed for a dislocation to escape from a
pinning center. In order to compute these times we consider that a pinning center pins a dislocation if the distance
between them is smaller then ξc = 3ξP = 3 (otherwise the attraction force between them is considered negligible).
In Tab. I we report the time ratio ta/tc for the same values of driving velocity V , mobility ratio µ/χ, and inverse8

temperature 1/T for which the average stress ⟨σ⟩has been computed and displayed in Fig. 2. First of all, we can
observe that for V →∞or µ/χ →0 or 1/T →0, the time ratio become: ta/tc = (2 · ξc)/(d −2 · ξc) = 0.6 where d
is the dislocation average interdistance. Indeed, in these conditions we can consider the pinning centers to be ﬁxed
respect to dislocations (or vice versa) during the dynamics and the ratio ta/tc become nothing more than the ratio
between the average (in time) length per dislocation and pinning center over which dislocations are considered pinned
(that is α(tav)·2 ·ξc) and that over which they are not (that is α(tav)·(d−2 ·ξc)) where α(tav) is the same parameter
for the two lengths and depends only on the time tav over which the average is performed. Looking at the values
displayed in Tab.I, we can observe that in general the time ratio ta/tc decreases signiﬁcantly as V increases, or as
µ/χ or 1/T decreases, but only for µ/χ = 0.5 and V = 0.003 we have that ta/tc remains small (bigger than, but near,
the value 0.6) for changing 1/T . In particular, for µ/χ = 0.5, V = 0.003 and 1/T = 104, 2 · 103, the two times ta and
tc (which ratio is displayed in bold on Tab.I) are of the same order of magnitude, but the pinning centers, for these
parameter values, are not ﬁxed respect to dislocations (or vice versa).
In the end we can conclude that for values of parameters V , µ/χ and 1/T for which serration is observed, we have
that the two relevant times ta and tc are of the same order of magnitude (remembering that the value 0.6 corresponds
to a special case in our model). This is in agreement with phenomenological models [13] and represents a link between
microscopic DDD model parameters (appearing in Eqs. 12,13,14) from which the quantities ta and tc can be computed,
and macroscopic quantities like V , µ/χ and T .
VI.
SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF DISLOCATIONS AND IMPURITIES
Analysing spatio-temporal distributions of pinning centers and dislocations can help to better understand and
unify previous considerations and results. First of all, we computed the average pinning centers distribution ρp.c.
averaging each distribution of pinning centers around every dislocation, and averaging over 50 diﬀerent realizations
of the dynamics. In the lower part of Fig. 4 we display average pinning center distributions around dislocations for
diﬀerent times that correspond to diﬀerent value of the average stress (which values are indicated in the upper stress
vs time graphic of the same ﬁgure). The more interesting case, reported in Fig.4 and corresponding to Fig.2(d), is
that for which changing temperature causes serration appearance or disappearance (that is for µ/χ = 0.5, V = 0.003).
The distributions ρp.c. are unnormalized so that the average number of pinning centers that pins dislocations are
obtained by the integral:
R ξc
−ξc ρp.c.(xp.c.)dxp.c. = ⟨Np⟩. To understand what happens when serration in the stress
appears, we reported in Fig. 4 the distributions in correspondence of stress drop, bump and re-drop. For temperatures
for which the stress do not develops serration (for 1/T = 4·102, 2·103), the distribution shape of pinning centers around
dislocations do not change in time and displays a peak more or less wide and narrow depending on the values of V , µ/χ
and 1/T . For temperatures for which serration develops (for 1/T = 104), the distributions change in a way that when
pinning centers reach dislocations from the right side (indeed V = 0.003 > 0), Fig. 4(b), and start to pin them, stress
drops because dislocations are accelerated (see Eq. 13), then after a while dislocation velocities go down because
they are pinned (when the corresponding distribution has developed a wide narrow peak), Fig. 4(c),(d). Finally,
when dislocations are able to depin and then their velocities start to increase again, the stress re-drops, Fig. 4(e),(f).
Above, analysing the stationary value of the stress (Fig. 2), we argued that at low temperatures (in Fig.2(c),(e),(f))
dislocations are completely pinned, and veriﬁed that by means of the formula ⟨σ⟩s = V [(Np/N)χ + µ] previously
obtained from the equations of motion imposing the condition of complete pinning. Integrating the distributions of
pinning centers, ρp.c., for low temperatures, we can obtain the average number of pinning centers around dislocations
that is ⟨Np⟩= Np/N = 8 which conﬁrms directly that in these cases all pinning centers are pinning dislocations.
Computing the standard deviation of the average distribution in Fig.4, conﬁrms that when serration emerges, for
1/T = 104, dislocations depin in a choerent way. Indeed, in this case the standard deviation is big near the peak of the
distribution, while is quite small away from it. In the cases in which serration is not observed, for 1/T = 104, 4 · 102,9

FIG. 4: Spatio-temporal distribution of pinning centers around dislocations. The distributions are obtained averaging for a
speciﬁc time the diﬀerent distributions around every dislocation, and averaging over 50 diﬀerent realizations of the dynamics.
In the lower par of the ﬁgure are indicated with xp.c. the pinning centers position and with xdisl. the dislocation position. The
vertical dashed blue line indicate the dislocation position and the two vertical dotted blue lines indicate the cutoﬀξc of the
dislocation-pinning centers interaction. In the upper part of the ﬁgure, the average stress for a speciﬁc time region is indicated.
The corresponding complete curve is reported in Fig. 2.
the standard deviation is almost constant in time and space.
Considering this result and that, in particular for
1/T = 4 · 102, the time ratio ta/tc (see Tab. I) is the same as for the case 1/T = 104, and that the average curve is
constant in time, we can conclude that when serration disappear, this means that dislocations depin in a incoherent
way (at diﬀerent times).
In Fig. 5 we can see a representative portion of dislocations and pinning centers motion in the case in which serration
is not present (a), and that in which it appears (b). The dark lines are dislocations. They have a slope equal to
V = 0.003, unless small deviations in correspondence of pinning centers (the green lines) pinning dislocations. In
Fig. 5b the vertical dotted and dashed red lines correspond to times for which the average stress has a minimum
and a maximum respectively. The minimum in the average stress correspond to many dislocations that are pinned,
while the successive maximum to many dislocations that depin. These processes are also present at intermediate
times, that cause the appearance of small oscillations in the average stress between a big peak and a big valley (see
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(d)). The dashed blu line, y ∼vdriftt, indicates the drift of pinning centers that move with velocity
vdrift ≃2.5 · 10−4. This drift is caused by the interaction with dislocations.
In Fig. 6 we can see the entire dynamics of all dislocations in a case in which there is not serration (a), and another
in which it appears (b). In particular, the term V t is subtracted to dislocation positions, so we have horizontal
lines, while in Fig. 5 we have lines with a slope equal to V . Moreover, the position of dislocations are rescaled in
order to have that the average inter-distance between them is 0.5 instead of d = 16. This last rescaling has been
done to evidence the ﬂuctuations of dislocations position. Like in Fig. 5, the vertical dotted and dashed red lines
correspond to times for which the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively. From Fig. 6b we can
see essentially two interesting things: minimum and maximum values in the rescaled dislocations position correspond
to maximum and minimum values in the average stress respectively; and the ﬂuctuation proﬁle of the position of one
dislocation (in correspondence of serration) can propagate with a velocity of V −vdrift. This last point means that
when pinning centers start to clustering, they remain usually clustered during the entire dynamics. The dashed blue
line y ∼−0.5/[d/(V −vdrift)]x = −0.875 · 10−4x in Fig. 6b indicate this behavior of pinning centers.10
FIG. 5: Representative portion of dislocations and pinning centers motion for a single realization of the dynamics for parameter
values: V = 0.003, µ/χ = 0.5 and 1/T = 4 · 102 (a), 1/T = 104 (b). The dark lines with a slope equal to V = 0.003 are
dislocations, and the green lines are pinning centers. (b) The vertical dotted and dashed red lines correspond to times for which
the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively. The dashed blu line y ∼vdriftt indicates the drift of pinning
centers that move with velocity vdrift ≃2.5 · 10−4.

are rescaled in a way that the average inter-distance between them is 0.5 instead of d = 16.
(b) The dashed blue line
y ∼−0.5/[d/(V −vdrift)]x = −0.875 · 10−4x indicate clustering properties of pinning centers, as discussed in the text.
In Fig. 7 we display the superposition of ﬂuctuations in the position of all dislocations, ∆xi, in a case in which
there is no serration (a) and another in which it appears (b).
These ﬂuctuations has been obtained as: ∆xi =
(xi −V t) −⟨(xi −V t)⟩t, where the time average is performed on the entire dynamics. We also display the average of
all ∆xi with the relative standard deviation, and the vertical dotted and dashed lines correspond to times for which
the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively. We can see another time that the minimum and
maximum values of the average ﬂuctuation position correspond to the maximum and minimum in the average stress
respectively.

DISCUSSION
We investigated the dynamics of a dislocation assembly interacting with mobile impurities studying the case of a
one-dimensional dislocation pileup. In order to connect this model to the PLC eﬀect, we studied the stress response
of the system under an external constant strain rate. The free parameters of the system have been reduced to the
driving velocity V , that controls the imposed constant strain rate, the mobility ratio µ/χ between dislocations and
mobile impurities, and the temperature T . To this end, we have employed an eﬀective deﬁnition of temperature that
should be valid except for low temperatures and high stresses. Analysing the average stress of the system ⟨σ⟩in the11

parameter space (V, µ/χ, 1/T ), we found a region characterized by stationary ﬂuctuations in the stress (serration)
(see Fig. 3).
The interpretation for the onset of serration in the present model agrees with the general concept of DSA but takes
explicitly into account the role of dislocation mutual interactions. The emergence of serration corresponds to the
situation in which impurities diﬀuse at a rate that allows them to pin dislocations (i.e. the capturing time tc is not
too high). At the same time dislocations should be able to escape from pinning centers after an aging time ta which
implies that ta is not too high, otherwise when dislocations unpin, they would move at large speed until they are
arrested again and pinning centers will not be able to reach them, but also not too small, because in this case pinning
centers will not be able to pin dislocations. Serration correspond to the case in which the two characteristic time
scales, ta and tc, are of the same order of magnitude (see Tab. I).
From another point of view, the origin of serration, in a speciﬁc range of parameter values (V, µ/χ, T ), is due
to the localization of impurities in a limited number of clouds under the action of dislocation induced stresses and
to the possibility for dislocations to escape from their pinning clouds without randomizing excessively the spatial
distribution of impurities. The spatial localization of pinning centers is only possible due to the coherent action of
several interacting dislocations. If we randomize the interaction between dislocations, for instance by choosing Burgers
vectors bi for each dislocation i from a random distribution, serration disappears. Spatial randomization of pinning
centers results in an incoherent contribution to the total stress ﬂuctuations of each dislocation and in the impossibility
to form clouds of pinning centers and therefore in the disappearance of serration. Only when the contribution of each
dislocation to the total stress ﬂuctuations are coherent, serration is observed.
In order to extend the validity of the deﬁnition of temperature and generalize the present model, the following
eﬀects could be introduced: i) a viscosity therm for dislocations; ii) pinning centers with diﬀerent mobilities. The last
modiﬁcation could give diﬀerent type of serration like in experiments in which three types of bands can be identiﬁed
(type A,B,C) [13].
