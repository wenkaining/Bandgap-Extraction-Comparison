A thermodynamic approach to rapid phase transformations within a diﬀuse interface in a binary
system is developed. Assuming an extended set of independent thermodynamic variables formed
by the union of the classic set of slow variables and the space of fast variables, we introduce
ﬁniteness of the heat and solute diﬀusive propagation at the ﬁnite speed of the interface advancing.
To describe the transformation within the diﬀuse interface, we use the phase-ﬁeld model which
allows us to follow the steep but smooth change of phases within the width of diﬀuse interface.
The governing equations of the phase-ﬁeld model are derived for the hyperbolic model, model with
memory, and for a model of nonlinear evolution of transformation within the diﬀuse-interface. The
consistency of the model is proved by the condition of positive entropy production and by the
outcomes of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. A comparison with the existing sharp-interface
and diﬀuse-interface versions of the model is given.

INTRODUCTION
Arising from phase transformations, a classic free-
boundary problem introduces a model of phase interface
with zero thickness. Within this problem, a sharp dis-
continuity in properties or a jump of ﬂuxes and ther-
modynamic functions occurs across the interface. The
sharp-interface model has been a successful description of
many physical phenomena in various systems [1]. How-
ever, the sharp-interface model has diﬃculties in describ-
ing situations when interfacial thickness becomes com-
parable with the characteristic length of the considered
phenomenon, and when a topology of the interface be-
comes complicated or multiply connected. In order to
avoid these diﬃculties in the sharp-interface model, an
alternative model with a ﬁnite interfacial thickness was
suggested for explaining phase transformations [2].
Historically, the ﬁrst formulation of basic principles of
diﬀuse interfaces was given by Poisson, Maxwell, and
Gibbs [3] who suggested to consider interface as a re-
gion with ﬁnite thickness in which a steep but smooth
transition of physical properties of phases occurs. Lord
Rayleigh, van der Waals, and Korteweg [4] applied ther-
modynamical principles to develop gradient theories for
the interfaces with non-zero thickness. Through the past
century, ideas of diﬀuse interface given by these authors
[3, 4] were reﬁned and applied in many physical phenom-
ena (see, e.g., overviews in Ref. [5]).
The diﬀuse-interface formalism has been widely ap-
plied to phase transformations in condensed media. Bor-
rowing the formalism of the Landau theory of phase
transitions [6], the ﬁrst introduction of the diﬀuse inter-
∗e-mail: Peter.Galenko@dlr.de; Fax: ++49-(2203)-6012255
face into the theory of phase transformations was made
by Landau and Khalatnikov [7] who labelled the diﬀer-
ent phases by an additional order parameter to describe
anomalous sound absorption of liquid helium.
In its
well-known form, the formal variational approach was es-
tablished by Ginzburg and Landau for phase transitions
from the normal to the superconducting phase [8]. On
the basis of this approach, diﬀuse-interface models with
order parameters have been developed by Halperin, Ho-
henberg and Ma for the theory of critical phenomena [9],
and by Allen and Cahn for antiphase domain coarsening
[10].
The diﬀuse-interface model has been also developed for
the description of phase transformations of the ﬁrst or-
der, especially, for the solidiﬁcation phenomenon. The
diﬀuse-interface model of solidiﬁcation incorporates an
order parameter in the form of a phase-ﬁeld variable [11].
The phase-ﬁeld Φ has a constant value in homogeneous
phases, e.g. Φ = −1 for unstable liquid phase which is
transforming into the solid phase with Φ = +1. Between
these phases in the interfacial region, the phase ﬁeld, Φ,
changes steeply but smoothly from −1 to +1. In numer-
ical solutions, it allows one to avoid explicit tracking of
the interface and locate the interface at Φ = 0 [12]. As
a particular case, the phase-ﬁeld model is reduced to the
sharp interface limits [13] and adopts the major models
of sharp interface (such as Hele-Shaw type models, classi-
cal or modiﬁed Stefan problem, etc.). The phase-ﬁeld Φ
is considered as an order parameter which is introduced
to describe the moving interfacial boundary between the
initially unstable phase and the ﬁnal phase.
Several
thermodynamically
consistent
phase-ﬁeld
models have been proposed [14, 15, 16, 17]. These in-
clude models for transformation in a pure system [14] up
to the rather general modelling of multiphase transfor-
mation in a multi-component system [17]. All of these2
models assume local equilibrium in the system, being
consistent with the basic hypothesis of the classic irre-
versible thermodynamics (CIT) [18, 19]. This assump-
tion leads to the examination of a number of transport
processes with small and moderate deviations from ther-
modynamic equilibrium and, as a consequence, relatively
slow movement of the interface can be predicted.
In
principle, such an approach can be extended to the case
when the condition of equilibrium is violated locally at
the interface, e.g., as it has been made for solute trap-
ping and kinetic eﬀects [20].
However, the local equi-
librium is missing both at the interface and within the
bulk phases for rapid transformations such as rapid so-
lidiﬁcation [21].
In this case, the description of rapid
phase trasformations might be provided by the formal-
ism of extended irreversible thermodynamics (EIT) [22]
which gives a causal description of transport processes
and abandons the assumption of local equilibrium. An
extension of the phase-ﬁeld methodology for rapid trans-
formation, which is caused by signiﬁcant deviations from
thermodynamic equilibrium, has been made recently [23].
The main purpose of the present paper is to describe
a thermodynamically consistent model for rapid phase
transformation in a binary system under local nonequi-
librium conditions.
Using the phase-ﬁeld methodol-
ogy, we derive the governing equations compatible with
the macroscopic formalism of EIT and the microscopic
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, a ther-
modynamic description of a considered system is given.
We introduce the dissipative diﬀusion ﬂuxes for heat
and mass transport together with the phase-ﬁeld rate of
change as independent variables. In Sec. III, the gen-
eralized Gibbs equation and entropy balance applicable
to rapid advancing of the diﬀuse interfaces are given. As
a starting point of the present phase-ﬁeld model, an en-
tropy functional is used in Sec. IV. The analysis of the
present phase-ﬁeld model leads to the governing equa-
tions for the hyperbolic system with dissipation. In Sec.
V, a generalization of the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model
is given using the ﬂux relaxation functions as well as a
variational principle. In Sec. VI, the model equations
are compared with the outcomes of the existing sharp-
interface and diﬀuse-interface models.
Finally, in Sec.
VII we present a summary of our conclusions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
A.
Thermodynamic variables
Let us consider an isobaric binary system at nonuni-
form temperature T with no convective ﬂow and given
concentration of atoms A and B. The local equilibrium
hypothesis establishes that the local and instantaneous
correlations among the properties of the system are the
same as for the whole system at a global equilibrium.
Describing the nonequilibrium system as an ensemble of
small local volumes in internal equilibrium, CIT [19] is
applicable to processes not too far from equilibrium. In
addition to CIT, a local nonequilibrium formalism appli-
cable to the strongly nonequilibrium systems has been
developed in past two decades [22, 24, 25, 26].
As a
phenomenological theory, this formalism is well-known
as EIT [22, 27] which goes beyond the hypothesis of lo-
cal equilibrium and avoids the paradox of propagation of
disturbances with an inﬁnite speed.
A fundamental problem in attempting to describe sys-
tems out of equilibrium is to select the relevant variables
needed for a valid description of a nonequilibrium state.
This problem has been intensively discussed in the liter-
ature (see references in bibliographic overview [28]). A
selection of the basic state space with the inclusion of
the dissipative ﬂuxes is formulated in EIT [24] and tested
against experimental data [29]. Accordingly, we extend
the classic set of independent thermodynamic variables
by the inclusion of dissipative ﬂuxes as additional basic
variables.
CIT is based on the local equilibrium hypothesis [18,
19] which assumes instant relaxation of ﬂuxes to their
steady-state values and describes the ensemble of atoms
within local volumes by the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics.
In the standard formalism of the diﬀuse-interface using
CIT, the set {C} of independent variables is assumed to
consist of the conserved variables such as energy density
e(⃗r, t) and concentration X(⃗r, t) = XB/(XA + XB) of
the B component in the system, and the non-conserved
phase-ﬁeld Φ(⃗r, t) variable [where t is the time, and ⃗r is
the position-vector of a point within system]. This can
be expressed formally as follows: {C} = {e, X, Φ}.
The extended space of independent variables E is
formed by the union of the classical set {C} and the
additional space {F} of the ﬂuxes of heat ⃗q and solute
⃗J, and also the rate of change ∂Φ/∂t of the phase-ﬁeld
variable, i.e. {F} = {⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t}. This yields
E = {C} ∪{F} = {e, X, Φ} ∪{⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t}.
(1)
Here {F} is the space of fast non-conserved thermody-
namic variables.
There are, in fact, diﬀerent possible choices of variables
(ﬂuxes in EIT, microstructural details in theories with
internal variables), and the speciﬁc choice to be adopted
depends on the aims of the description and on the prob-
lems to be analyzed. This does not mean that diﬀerent
choices of variables are incompatible with each other. For
instance, in the study of ﬂowing polymer solutions one
may select as independent variables either the viscous
pressure tensor or the conformation tensor describing the
average microstructure of the macromolecules of the sys-
tem; a Legendre transform exists which allows one to
pass from one description to the other, in a similar way
as it is possible, in equilibrium thermodynamics, to pass
from a description using internal energy as independent
variable to a description using absolute temperature as
an independent variable [30].3
Thus, our choice of the ﬂuxes as variables does not ex-
clude other possibilities. To justify our choice, we com-
ment on the qualitative grounds, the meaning and the
relevance of ⃗q, ⃗J, and ∂Φ/∂t as variables.
The ﬂuxes
⃗q and ⃗J describe the exchanges of heat and matter be-
tween the interface and the neighbouring bulk phases.
The ﬂuxes do not instantaneously follow by the classical
Fourier and Fick laws, relating them with temperature
and concentration gradients, it takes them some time
(usually rather short) to reach the value predicted by
the classical transport equations. Obviously, when the
interface motion is fast enough, the delay eﬀects in the
dynamics of the ﬂuxes may play a determining role. This
happens, for instance, when the velocity V of the inter-
face becomes comparable or higher than l/τ, l being the
mean-free-path of the particles and τ the relaxation time
of the ﬂuxes. Thus, in these circumstances, ⃗q and ⃗J be-
have as independent variables with their own dynamics,
which has important consequences on the dynamics and
stability of the interface [31, 32].
The introduction of ∂Φ/∂t as a further independent
variable is motivated by similar, though slightly diﬀerent
consideration. Indeed, the space variation of Φ is related,
among other factors, to the width of the interface. Thus,
including ∂Φ/∂t as an independent variable allows for
a more detailed description of the internal kinetics and
shape of the interface. In the same way as in Newto-
nian mechanics, where the initial position and velocity
of a particle must be speciﬁed to determine their evo-
lution, here we take both Φ and ∂Φ/∂t as independent
variables. If inertial eﬀects are suﬃciently low in com-
parison with dissipative eﬀects, ∂Φ/∂t will be directly
determined in terms of Φ and its gradient by a dynamical
equation. Otherwise, Φ and ∂Φ/∂t will be independent
and an equation for ∂2Φ/∂t2 must be found.
Consequently, with taking the above choice of vari-
ables, one may distinguish between the two sets of inde-
pendent variables as it follows. The variables from the
set {C} are characterized as the slow variables, as their
behavior is governed by conservation laws for energy and
solute concentration plus the evolution of the phase-ﬁeld,
and as they decay slowly in time. In contrast, the inde-
pendent space {F} consists of non-conserved variables
with relatively high rate of decay. The variables from
{F} diﬀer from their classical value during intervals of
the order of magnitude of the characteristic times τi for
relaxation of the heat ﬂux, solute diﬀusion ﬂux, and rate
of change of the phase-ﬁeld variable. For time intervals
much longer than these relaxation times τi, the rate of
variation of the ﬂuxes can be ignored.
B.
Relaxation times
Generally, the relaxation times τi represent physically
reasonable time estimations for the spontaneous return of
the system to the steady state after some sudden pertur-
bation. The relaxation times τT and τD for the heat and
solute can be considered as the times needed for smooth-
ing of inhomogeneities of temperature and concentration,
respectively, by diﬀusion. The time τΦ of relaxation for
the phase-ﬁeld can be evaluated from the velocity of the
diﬀuse interface moving through the local volume with
the characteristic spatial length. Consequently, the rate
of decay of the heat ﬂux ⃗q, solute diﬀusive ﬂux ⃗J, and
phase-ﬁeld rate of change ∂Φ/∂t are estimated by the
following characteristic times
τT = a/V 2
T ,
τD = D/V 2
D,
τΦ = l/V,
(2)
where a is the thermal diﬀusivity, VT the ﬁnite speed for
heat diﬀusion (i.e. the speed of propagation of temper-
ature disturbances), D the solute diﬀusion constant, VD
the ﬁnite speed for diﬀusion (i.e. the speed of propaga-
tion of concentration disturbances), V the velocity of the
diﬀuse interface, and l the spatial length.
For instance, the time τT is deﬁned by the phonon-
electron and phonon-phonon interactions for heat diﬀu-
sion in metallic systems and it is estimated in Ref. [33] to
be in the range of 10−13s < τT < 10−11s. The time τD is
deﬁned by the time for diﬀusion jumps of particles, which
varies within a wide interval: 10−11s < τD < 10−7s in a
binary alloy system or inorganic solution [34]. In addition
to this, the time τΦ might be evaluated numerically from
Eq. (2) assuming that the length l = W0 the width of
the diﬀuse interface and the velocity V is the character-
istic velocity for rapid adiabatic transformations. Thus,
for numeric evaluation of τΦ in a pure system, one may
accept the following expression
τΦ = W0χ/(µ0Q),
(3)
where Q is the heat of transformation, χ is the heat ca-
pacity (so that relation Q/χ is considered as the charac-
teristic temperature for adiabatic transformation), and
µ0 the coeﬃcient for atomic kinetics.
Taking the val-
ues for pure nickel, e.g., Q/χ = 418 K [35], µ0 = 0.52
m/(s·K) [36], and W0 = 5 · 10−9 m, one gets τΦ =
2.30 · 10−11 s. This value for τΦ ﬁts well to the time of
diﬀuse-interface kinetics which might be calculated from
the “thin-interface” analyses of Karma and Rappel [37]
extended by Bragard et al. [38].
It is also reasonable to evaluate the relaxation time for
the phase-ﬁeld in a binary system using outcomes of the
phase-ﬁeld model via “thin-interface” analyses of Karma
and Rappel [37]. Namely, for the nonisothermal solidi-
ﬁcation of a binary system, Ramirez et al. [39] derived
the time τΦ for the phase-ﬁeld as a function of X and Φ.

ing from Eq. (4), one gets τΦ = 7.92 · 10−11 s for the
values of X = 70 at.% and Φ = 0.5.
The values for the relaxation times for some pure and
binary systems are summarized in Table I.
It can be
seen, e.g. for metals and alloys, that even though the
heat speed VT is much larger than the solute diﬀusion
speed VD, the relaxation times for ⃗q and ⃗J have the same
order of magnitude, i.e. τT ≈τD. Therefore, a front of
the heat proﬁle moves with a speed much higher than a
front of the solute diﬀusive proﬁle. However, due to the
fast thermal diﬀusion, a >> D, the relaxation of the heat
ﬂux ⃗q proceeds approximately at the same characteristic
time as the relaxation for solute diﬀusion ﬂux ⃗J.

ENTROPY APPROACH
A.
Generalized Gibbs equation
For the local nonequilibrium system described in Sec.
II, we postulate the existence of a local generalized en-
tropy density s whose set of variables is the extended
space E by Eq. (1). The generalized Gibbs equation for
s is described by
ds(e, X, Φ, ⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t) = dse(e, X, Φ)

(5)
In Eq. (5), se is a local equilibrium contribution deﬁned
on the set {C} of the classic slow variables {e, X, Φ}, and
sne is a ﬂux-dependent purely nonequilibrium part of the
generalized entropy deﬁned on the space {F} consisting
of the ﬂuxes {⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t} as the independent fast vari-
ables.
The derivatives of the entropy density with respect to
classical variables and their ﬂuxes appearing in Eq. (5)
are described by

where ∆µ = µA −µB is the diﬀerence of the chemical
potentials for components A and B, respectively, and
sA and sB are the entropies for pure components A and
B, respectively. The chemical potentials and entropies
of components can be chosen for every concrete system
(see, e.g., Refs. [15, 17]).
In Eqs. (6), the coeﬃcients αi are scalars which do not
depend on ⃗q, ⃗J, and ∂Φ/∂t and are assumed to be

where κ is the thermal conductivity, a0 a dimension-
less factor (dependent on the model of the diﬀuse in-
terface, speciﬁcally leading to the sharp-interface asymp-
totic limit), and Q the heat of the transformation.
After integration, Eq. (5) can be written in the form
s(e, X, Φ, ⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t) = se(e, X, Φ) + sne(⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t),

Consequently, we arrive to a generalized entropy density
given by an expansion around its local equilibrium value
up to second-order in the ﬂuxes. In the limit of inﬁnite
speeds (VT →∞, VD →∞, and V →∞), one gets
τT →0, τD →0, and τΦ →0.
In such a case, the
term sne vanishes and Eq. (8) gives the entropy density
se(e, X, Φ) for local equilibrium system.5

HYPERBOLIC PHASE-FIELD MODEL
In this section, the important class of hyperbolic mod-
els with dissipation is considered. We work out the ex-
plicit evolution equations for the variables including the
relaxation terms.

Here εe, εx, and εφ are constants for the energy, concen-
tration, and phase-ﬁeld, respectively. In the functional
(14) the gradient terms |∇e|2, |∇X|2, and |∇Φ|2 are used
to describe spatial inhomogeneity within the ﬁelds ac-
cording to previous diﬀuse-interface models [8, 10, 12].
It is logical to include gradient terms in Eq. (14) [of the
so-called “Ginzburg-Landau form”] because, as stressed
before, our interest is focused on interfaces with steep
gradients. In addition, the extension (1) gives the en-
tropy density s based also on the ﬂuxes ⃗q, ⃗J, and ∂Φ/∂t
as independent variables.
To obtain the evolution of the entropy, Eq. (11),
and consider the several parts of the entropy exchange,
Eqs. (12)-(13), we diﬀerentiate Eq. (14) with respect to
time. Combining the terms, after some algebra one ob-

B.
Governing equations and thermodynamic
consistency
Relation (18) is well known from the phase-ﬁeld model
based on CIT (see, e.g., Ref. [15]), whereas the entropy
production (19) includes the additional terms −αq∂⃗q/∂t,
−αj∂⃗J/∂t, and −αφ∂2Φ/∂t2 related to the nonequilib-
rium part of the generalized entropy. This is due to the
special form for entropy, Eq. (8), and has a clear physical
meaning: far from equilibrium, the dissipative ﬂuxes pro-
vide ordering that leads to a decrease of the entropy pro-
duction near a steady state as compared with the local-
equilibrium state characterized by the same values of e,
X, and Φ.
The production σS of the generalized entropy, Eq. (8)
is positive due to the statement of the second law of ther-
modynamics. This condition implies a relation between
ﬂuxes and forces which, in the simplest cases, is assumed
to be linear. For Eq. (19), it gives the following set of
equations:

port, and Mφ is the mobility of the diﬀuse interface.7
Dependent on composition, the interface mobility is as-
sumed to be
Mφ = (1 −X)M A
φ + XM B
φ > 0,
(23)
where M A
φ and M B
φ are the interface mobility for the
transformation in pure systems consisting of A or B
components, respectively. In various formulations of the
phase-ﬁeld model [20, 37], the mobilities of M A
φ and M B
φ
are proportional to the atomic interface kinetic coeﬃcient
µ0 and inversely proportional to the interface width W0,
so that Mφ ∼µ0/W0.
The matrix (22) of transport and the interface mobility
(23) are assumed to be positively deﬁned for the positive
entropy production σS. The matrix (22) can be consid-
ered as symmetric, so that the matrix can be regarded as
being positive with the inequality: MeeMxx > M 2
ex. Note
that the linear phenomenological laws given by Eqs. (20)
and (21) adopt the representation theorem of isotropic
tensors [48] according to which ﬂuxes and forces of dif-
ferent tensorial rank do not couple as far as linear re-
lations are involved (this independence of processes of
diﬀerent tensorial rank is also known as the Curie princi-
ple). In our case, the vectors of heat and solute diﬀusion
ﬂuxes cannot give rise to the ﬂux of the scalar phase-ﬁeld
ﬂux in a linear description. More complicated nonlinear
relations between ﬂuxes and forces consistent with posi-
tive entropy production in EIT are considered elsewhere
[22, 24, 27].
For simplicity, we ignore both kinds of “cross coupling”
eﬀects in Eq. (20), so that Mex = Mxe = 0.
Then,
substitution of the ﬂuxes from Eq. (20) into the balances
(9), respectively, gives

where τΦ = αφMφ is the timescale of the phase-ﬁeld ki-
netics. According to Eq. (26), the acceleration ∂2Φ/∂t2
of the phase-ﬁeld appears due to introduction of both
Φ and ∂Φ/∂t as independent variables and characterizes
inertial eﬀects inside the width of diﬀuse interface.
Equations (24)-(26) are the central outcome of our pro-
posal [or, to mention a more complicated setting, we
could also refer to equations (20)-(21)]. The role of the
relaxation times is clear: they characterize the delay with
which ⃗q and ⃗J reduce to their classical expressions (corre-
sponding to classical transport equations), and the delay
with which the inertial eﬀects in the dynamics of the
interfacial region are lost.
The relaxation terms may
be neglected in many circumstances, but become crucial
in some important situations, leading, for instance, to a
maximum possible value for the speed of advancement of
the interface (in contrast to classic theory which allows
for an inﬁnite speed of propagation), and to the possibil-
ity of oscillatory phenomena in the width of the interface.
Thus, the role of the new terms is not simply to add some
new undetermined parameters (relaxation times) allow-
ing for an improved ﬁt of experimental results. These
terms also play an important conceptual role, as they
drastically change the possible kinds of behavior of the
system.
Some comments on the consistency of our proposal can
be outlined. First of all, we may refer to its internal con-
sistency as a thermodynamic (macroscopic) theory. Sec-
ond, one must check its consistency with microscopic de-
scriptions based, for instance, on kinetic theory, or on lin-
ear response theory, or in other statistical (microscopic)
theories.
Finally, one must check its consistency with
experimental results.
Here, we comment on the internal thermodynamic
consistency and, in the next Section, we shall refer to
its consistency with a statistical theory, based on the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. In this theoretical pa-
per we do not refer to experimental results. We assume
that a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory
should satisfy two main conditions:
(i) the generalized or extended entropy must be maxi-
mum at equilibrium;
(ii) the entropy production must be positive.
To these two conditions one could add two more re-
quirements:
(iii) the second diﬀerential of the entropy with respect
to its basic variables (which is related to the dynamics
of the variables) must be negative in order to lead to dy-
namically stable solutions;
(iv) the generalized equations of state obtained by diﬀer-
entiation of the generalized entropy must have a physical
meaning consistent with experiments.
It can be seen immediately that the essential condi-
tions (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed in our proposal. Indeed,
the form (8) and (14) of the entropy guarantees that ho-
mogeneous equilibrium state has the maximum entropy
as compared to nonequilibrium states with the same local
values of e, X and Φ. Furthermore, introduction of the
constitutive equations (20)-(21) into the expression (19)
of the entropy production yields for the latter a deﬁnite
positive expression:

As we noted, the transport matrix (M) and the inter-
face mobility Mφ are assumed to be positively deﬁned
for the positive entropy production, σS > 0.
If one
included higher-order nonlinear terms into the entropy
(8) or in the constitutive equations (20)-(21), thermody-
namic consistency would be more diﬃcult to check than
in our second-order approximation (8). This approxima-
tion is suﬃcient to deal with a wide range of physical
problems.
We shall not deal with conditions (iii) and (iv), which
are subtler and typically involve nonlinear eﬀects. For an
indication of their analysis in some situations involving
only ⃗q as nonequilibrium variables, the reader is referred
to the monograph [24].
V.
GENERALIZATION OF THE MODEL
The governing equations (24)-(26) present causal prop-
agation of heat and mass signals and a dissipative-wave
advancing of a diﬀuse interface. We generalize them into
evolution equations which are nonlinear in time. First,
equations of state are considered from the point of view
of the relaxation functions for the ﬂuxes. Second, non-
linear evolution equations of a general type are derived
from a variational formulation.
A.
Relaxation functions for the ﬂuxes
Let’s take into consideration a prehistory of the change
of the phase-ﬁeld in a point of a system. Such a prehis-
tory must be taken if the system is not in local equi-
librium.
We shall use a functional description with a
memory function.
We use the entropy functional (14), as before, to derive
the equations of the model. In the absence of local equi-
librium, one may incorporate the prehistory of the diﬀu-
sion process. Then, the connections between the ﬂuxes,
⃗q, ⃗J, and ∂Φ/∂t, from the one side, and driving forces,
∇(δS/δe), ∇(δS/δX), and δS/δΦ, from the other side,
are deﬁned by the following integral forms:
- relaxation of the heat ﬂux
⃗q(⃗r, t) =

where DR = {Dq, Dj, Dφ} are the relaxational kernels for
the ﬂuxes, and the variational derivatives are obtained

(31)
After substitution of expressions for the heat ﬂux re-
laxation, Eq. (28), and the solute diﬀusion relaxation,
Eq. (29), into the balance laws for energy and solute con-
centration, Eq. (9), respectively, one can get the following
integro-diﬀerential equations

Together with relaxation of the phase-ﬁeld, Eq. (30), the
general system evolution during phase transformation is
described by Eqs. (32).
When the relaxation functions DR are specially de-
ﬁned, Eqs. (30) and (32) can be reduced to known mod-
els. Particularly, for the important class of dissipative
and hyperbolic models, one can take the relaxation ker-
nels in the following forms
DR =

, wave and dissipation,
(33)
where DR(0) = {Dq(0), Dj(0), Dφ(0)} are the relax-
ational kernels for the ﬂuxes at present time t = t∗, and
τ = {τT , τD, τΦ} are the characteristic relaxation times
for the ﬂuxes.
The
diﬀerent
transformations within
the
diﬀuse-
interface are described by diﬀerent kernels in the inte-
grals (28)-(30). As it follows from Eq. (33), the relax-
ation functions DR describe the memory of the system
by assigning diﬀerent weights to diﬀerent moments in the
past. Dissipation corresponds to a zero-memory transfor-
mation, i.e. the only relevant contributions are the ”last”
ones.
In contrast to this situation, the inﬁnite mem-
ory transformation with DR ≡const leads to undamped
wave propagation of the heat, solute, or the interface
advancement. In between, the combination of the wave
and dissipative regimes described by the exponentional
law can be observed during rapid phase transformations.
This is the case of hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model described
in Sec. IV. For the latter case, the relevance of all con-
tributions to the ﬂuxes decreases as the system moves to
the past.
In Sec. IV, the model macroscopic consistency of the
statements of EIT has been shown. Now, the consistency9
of our macroscopic approach with a microscopic descrip-
tion is veriﬁed in relation to the outcomes following from
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.
The memory functions introduced in Eqs. (28)-(30)
may be related to our analysis of the dynamics of the
ﬂuxes ⃗q and ⃗J and of ∂Φ/∂t proposed by constitutive
equations (20)-(21). To do this, ﬁrst, we may consider the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem relating response mem-
ory functions to the time-correlation function of the cor-
responding ﬂuxes (see, e.g., Ref. [49]). This will allow us
to show the consistency of our macroscopic formulation
with the microscopic basis provided by the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem.
The corresponding expressions are
Dq(t −t∗) =
1
kBT 2 ⟨b⃗q(t)b⃗q(t∗)⟩eq,
Dj(t −t∗) =
1
kBT ⟨b⃗J(t)b⃗J(t∗)⟩eq,
Dφ(t −t∗) =
1
kBT ⟨d
∂tΦ(t)
d
∂tΦ(t∗)⟩eq.
(34)
Here kB is Boltzmann’s constant, ⃗q, ⃗J, and ∂tΦ stand
for the microscopic operators for the heat ﬂux, diﬀusion
ﬂux and the time derivative of Φ, respectively, and ⟨...⟩eq
means an average over an equilibrium ensemble in statis-
tical mechanics (as, for instance, the canonical one).
Relations (34) play an important role in modern statis-
tical mechanics, and may be formally derived from the Li-
ouville equation in the framework of linear-response the-
ory or from information theory [49, 50]. However, from a
practical point of view, the computation of the evolution
of the microscopic operators for ⃗q, ⃗J or ∂tΦ on purely mi-
croscopic grounds is an overwhelming task exceeding ac-
tual capabilities. Such an evolution is either obtained by
computer simulations, or tentatively given by a reason-
able form inspired on phenomenological grounds. Thus,
our evolution equations (20)-(21) for ⃗q, ⃗J and ∂tΦ may be
considered as a macroscopic modelling of the evolution
of the ﬂuxes, which according to Eq. (34) is equivalent
to proposing a form for the corresponding memory func-
tions introduced in Eqs. (28)-(30). In general terms, it
could be said that, according to Eq. (34), the study of
the evolution of the ﬂuxes around equilibrium is equiva-
lent to the determination of the corresponding memory
functions.
Constitutive equations (20)-(21) imply that ﬂuctua-
tions of ⃗q and ⃗J near a homogeneous equilibrium state
will decay exponentially as ⃗q(t) = ⃗q(0) exp(−t/τT ) and
⃗J(t) = ⃗J(0) exp(−t/τD). Introducing these expressions
into Eq. (34) one obtains
Dq(t −t∗) =
1
kBT 2 ⟨b⃗q(0)b⃗q(0)⟩eq exp

which may be rewritten as


−t −t∗

,
Dj(t −t∗) = Dj(0) exp

−t −t∗

.
(36)
Indeed, when the microscopic expressions for ⃗q and
⃗J corresponding to an ideal gas are introduced into
Eq. (36) and the equilibrium average is performed (over
a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function), the results
for the Dq(0) and Dj(0) are equivalent to those obtained
from the kinetic theory of gases in the time-relaxation
approximation [49].
Note, ﬁnally, that the usual transport coeﬃcients
(thermal conductivity, diﬀusion coeﬃcient) may be ob-
tained (when the relaxation time is suﬃciently short) by
integration of Eq. (34), as
λ =

⟨b⃗q(t)b⃗q(0)⟩eqdt,
D =

−∞
⟨b⃗J(t)b⃗J(0)⟩eqdt,
(37)
which are the well-known Green-Kubo formulae for trans-
port coeﬃcients [24, 49, 50].
Thus, our macroscopic
formalism is consistent with the microscopic ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. It provides, in fact, a phenomeno-
logical complement to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation expres-
sions, which are the formal expressions from which it is
diﬃcult to obtain on exact grounds the form of the mem-
ory functions.
B.
A variational principle and Euler-Lagrange
equations
We assume, as above, that the generalized entropy
density s is a continuous and diﬀerentiable function de-
ﬁned by the local equilibrium contribution se and ﬂux-
dependent nonequilibrium part sne with the total set of
variables (1) and generalized Gibbs equation (5). The
balance equations for the heat and solute are the same,
Eqs. (9), and the local evolution of the entropy density
is described by Eqs. (10).
A generalization can be given by introducing the gen-
eralized terms for derivatives into the entropy density
with respect to classical variables (e, X, Φ) and ﬂuxes
(⃗q, ⃗J, ∂Φ/∂t), and also by introducing general forms of
the entropy ﬂux ⃗JS and the source σS in Eq. (10). De-
pending on their own tensorial character, these are

on classic variables (e, X, Φ) and invariants Ii.
Then,
utilizing Eqs. (38), the generalized Gibbs equation (5)

Locally, Eq. (10) is satisﬁed as a balance law and, for
the entire system, one can postulate extremal condition
in the Lagrangian form of L =

in which the variation δ is carried out only on the noncon-

over the space {F} from the set (1) while the variables e,
X, and Φ from the set {C} remain constant during the
variation. Also, during the variation, the tangent ther-
modynamic space [time and spatial derivatives from the
set (1)] is ﬁxed. From this it follows that Eq. (41) is a
variational principle of a restricted type.

Eqs. (44)-(46) are nonlinear evolution equations for ⃗q,

lution equations (20)-(21).

tional principle (41), we arrive to nonlinear general evo-
lution equations for ﬂuxes, Eqs. (47), which might be
merely reduced to the evolution equations (20)-(21) of
the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model.
VI.
RELATION TO EXISTING MODELS
It is interesting to note that sharp-interface and
diﬀuse-interface models with relaxation of ﬂuxes have
been used to describe transient processes in various
nonequilibrium systems (see monograph [52], Chapter 4).
Therefore we synthesize here several previous and very
recent results in comparison with the developed hyper-
bolic model (Sec. IV) and generalized model (Sec. V) of
rapid phase transformation.
A.
Superconductivity
Ginzburg and Landau established their variational
principle for the continuous transition from the normal
to the superconducting phase [8]. They used a free en-
ergy density with a gradient term which has been further
used in many phenomena (e.g., in description of spinodal
decomposition [53] or crystal growth [54]).
As a logi-
cal extension, the transition between the normal and the
superconducting phases can be described with the de-
lay given by equations of the hyperbolic model [starting
from the functional of the form (14)] or using generalized
models with memory, Sec. V A.
Generally, equations (24)-(26) are consistent with the
generalized entropy density given by Eq. (8). The equa-
tions are reduced to the classic equations from Refs.
[8, 53, 54] when the times τT , τD, and τΦ tend to zero.
Furthermore, the entropy density (8) together with the
evolution equations (20) has been justiﬁed microscopi-
cally [24, 26] for the one-component system and from
Grad’s procedure for monatomic gases.
The choice of thermodynamic potential is important,
as it governs the transition from metastable state to the
stable one. Normally, the potential for transition is in-
cluded in the expression for entropy density (or for free
energy density) in the form of a double-well function
or by a monotonically increasing function incorporating
nonequilibrium conditions at the interface [8, 12, 38]. In
the present paper, we do not give an explicit form of se
in Eq. (8) and present governing equations (24)-(26) [or
variational derivatives (31)] in a general form. The choice
of the thermodynamic potential might be given for the
problem under consideration.
B.
Glass transition, structural relaxation and
phase separation
J¨ackle et al. [55] considered isothermal phase trans-
formation in the presence of additional slow structural
relaxation variables. Considering the dynamics based on
the relaxational chemical potential, these authors refer
their model to systems with phase separation and to slow
structural relaxation in polymeric solutions in the prox-
imity of the glass transition temperature. The calcula-
tion has shown that, even at the early stages of phase
separation, equation for chemical potential with memory
may give pronounced deviations from the predictions of
classic linear Cahn-Hillard’s model [53].
Phase separation during spinodal decomposition may
proceed under local nonequilibrium conditions in solute
diﬀusion ﬁeld oﬀered by rapid quenching.
As it has
been demonstrated in computational modeling [56], the
rapidly quenched liquid mixtures under decomposition
exhibit non-equilibrium patterns, evolving with univer-
salities diﬀerent from those extracted from the Cahn and
Hillard’s model.
Local nonequilibrium separation in liquids can be de-12
scribed in terms of EIT as a model for isothermal spin-
odal decomposition in a binary system [23], in conditions
of large deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium. The
dynamics of the diﬀusion ﬂux ⃗J as a fast variable from
the set (1) is consistent with the characteristic time of
local rearrangement of particles (atoms or molecules) or
with the time of relaxation of diﬀusive ﬂux to its local
equilibrium steady-state value. The model equation for
spinodal decomposition of a binary system is the gener-
alized Cahn-Hillard equation of the form of Eq. (25) for
local nonequilibrium solute redistribution. In this case,
the dynamics of rapidly quenched decomposition is de-
scribed for short periods of time or large gradients of
chemical composition.
C.
Shear ﬂow, viscoelastic ﬂuids and
diﬀusion-reaction systems
The system of coupled evolution equations (20)-(21)
describes, in fact, a process of phase separation under
shear if temperature is replaced by viscous pressure ten-
sor. In this case, one may get the condition deﬁning the
spinodal line in non-equilibrium states [see monograph
[30], Chapter 6]. As a reduced one, equation of type (20)
or (32), endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions, has been introduced to model the behavior of
certain viscoelastic ﬂuids and to predict the velocity of
ﬂow [57].
In addition, equation of type (32) is used to predict
a wavefront in time-delayed reaction-diﬀusion systems of
the generalized Fisher’s equation [58]. The speed of the
travelling wave depends on the relaxation time and there-
fore spreading of population in reaction-diﬀusion system
might be predicted with great ﬂexibility. One of the con-
sequences of this equation, reduced to Eqs. (24) or (25)
for modelling a hyperbolic reaction-diﬀusion system [with
εe = 0 or εx = 0, respectively], might be considered in
an exciting example suggested by Fort and Mendez in
Ref. [59] for neolitic advancing of human groups across
Europe. They have shown, in particular, that hyperbolic
reaction-diﬀusion equations of type of Eqs. (24) or (25)
predict the population spreading during the European
past in agreement with the existing archaeological data.
D.
Rapid solidiﬁcation
At deep supercoolings in a solidifying system, or at
high velocity of the solid-liquid interface, it is necessary
to take into account local nonequilibrium eﬀects in so-
lute diﬀusion and to use a non-Fickian model for trans-
port processes which is compatible with EIT [21, 40].
The problem of rapid solidiﬁcation within the sharp-
interface limit is described by generalized Stefan prob-
lem (so-called “self-consistent hyperbolic Stefan prob-
lem” [31, 32]) which takes into account local nonequilib-
rium both at the interface and within the bulk phases. In
such a case, the spatio-temporal evolution of solute con-
centration is described by the partial diﬀerential equation
(25) of a hyperbolic type [with εx = 0] which takes into
account the relaxation of solute diﬀusion ﬂux to the lo-
cal thermodynamical equilibrium in a rapidly solidifying
system.
Advancing of the diﬀuse-interface with a higher ve-
locity comparable with the solute diﬀusion speed is also
described by the phase-ﬁeld model with relaxation of the
diﬀusion ﬂux [23]. It has been shown that choosing the
concrete form of the entropy (as the thermodynamic po-
tential), one may recover the existing models based on
the CIT and analyze solidiﬁcation under local nonequi-
librium conditions.
E.
Motion of antiphase domains
In the description of diﬀuse interface kinetics, Allen
and Cahn [10] proposed a model for evolution of the
non-conserved order ﬁeld during antiphase domain coars-
ening. For isotropic interfaces, gradient ﬂow gives the
Allen-Cahn equation by taking τΦ = 0 in Eq. (26). This
equation is true in the case of low inertial eﬀects in com-
parison with the dissipative eﬀects.
With ﬁnite relax-
ation time, τΦ, and ﬁnite acceleration, ∂2Φ/∂t2, Eq. (26)
predicts the evolution of coarsening with relaxation. It is
reasonable to say that the generalized Allen-Cahn equa-
tion (26) is true for the case of signiﬁcant inertial eﬀects
during the motion of antiphase domains.
As an advancing of the Allen and Cahn’s model, the
process of the interface motion by mean curvature with
delayed response has been analyzed recently. Rotstein
et al.
[60] developed the phase-ﬁeld model based on
equations similar to Eqs. (28) and (30). These authors
described the ﬁrst-order transition with the delayed re-
sponse of the system due to slow relaxation of internal
variables. Using the exponential relaxation function for
wave and dissipative mode, Eq. (33), which leads to the
hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld model, the dynamics of the per-
turbed motion of interface by mean curvature has been
considered. It has been shown in Ref. [60] that internal
relaxing eﬀects induce damped oscillations in the inter-
facial motion during crystalline coarsening. As opposed
to the classic parabolic phase-ﬁeld model, the hyperbolic
phase-ﬁeld model predicts these interfacial oscillations in
qualitative consistency with the oscillations on the sur-
face of quantum crystals [61] and in crystallization waves
in helium [62]. From a mathematical viewpoint, a search
for existence and uniqueness of the solution and some
well-posedness results for the problem of motion by mean
curvature using the phase-ﬁeld model with memory are
beginning to be presented (see Ref. [63]).13
F.
Complex (dusty) plasmas
Recent investigation into the ﬁeld of complex (dusty)
plasma physics show that this system exhibits a com-
plicated behavior which depends on the behavior of its
“subsystems” which are represented by electrons, ions,
neutral gas, and charged dust particles. All of them have
their own relaxation time to local equilibrium; therefore,
interaction among them may lead to a delay of relaxation
to local equilibrium in plasma. Moreover, in the elec-
tronic subsystem of plasma, local equilibrium does not
exist, that stimulates development of theories beyond lo-
cal equilibrium [64]. Interaction of diﬀerent subsystems
in complex (dusty) plasmas with missing local thermody-
namic equilibrium in the electronic subsystem, makes the
description of observed experimental data of this object
rather complicated.
Experimental results of Morﬁll et al. [65] from plasma
observations exhibit unusual behavior from weak colli-
sionless interaction of gases to ﬂuid ﬂow with further
possible crystallization of plasma. These results are de-
scribed by means of molecular dynamic simulations [65].
The ﬁeld approach, also, seems to be also applicable due
to the fact that during transitions in plasma, the char-
acteristic size of patterns is on the mesoscopic or even
macroscopic scale.
The ﬁeld approach to a heat- and
electronically-conducting ﬂuid has been demonstrated in
ionized gases [51] using equations of generalized type of
Eqs. (44)-(46).
VII.
CONCLUSIONS
The diﬀuse-interface model for rapid phase transfor-
mation in metastable binary systems has been presented.
To describe the steep but smooth change of phases within
the width of diﬀuse interface, we use the formalism of the
phase-ﬁeld model.
Rapid phase transformations may proceed under lo-
cal nonequilibrium conditions. In our phenomenological
macroscopic description, we extend the classic set of in-
dependent thermodynamic variables by inclusion of dis-
sipative ﬂuxes as additional basic variables. The evolu-
tion of the ﬂuxes is characterized by their own dynamics
with relaxation times τ summarized in Table I. Thus,
the extended set (1) of variables allows one to describe
phase transformations with ﬁnite interface velocity that
is comparable or even higher than l/τ, where l is the
mean-free-path of particles (atoms).
The evolution equations for the hyperbolic phase-ﬁeld
model with dissipation are derived from an entropy func-
tional (14) based on the extended set (1) of independent
thermodynamic variables. This model yields a deﬁnite
positive entropy production (27) in consistency with the
second law of thermodynamics.
Generalization of the model has been done by introduc-
ing memory functions and using a variational principle.
As a result, the consistency of the macroscopic approach
with the microscopic ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem has
been found for the phase-ﬁeld with memory [Eqs. (34)-
(37)]; and nonlinear evolution equations [Eqs. (44)-(46)]
are derived from the variational principle (41).
The derived equations for the evolution of diﬀuse inter-
face were correlated with existing models of nonequilib-
rium transport processes and for systems under phase
transformation.
Particularly, we compare our deriva-
tion to models of superconductivity, phase separation,
viscoelastic or electronically-conducting ﬂuids, interface
motion by mean curvature, rapidly solidifying systems,
and reaction-diﬀusion systems.
