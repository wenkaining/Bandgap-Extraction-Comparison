Abstract: This paper applies the formalism of classical, Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical 
mechanics to the phenomenon of non-thermal damage. As an example, a non-thermal 
fiber-bundle model with the global uniform (meanfield) load sharing is considered. 
Stochastic topological behavior in the system is described in terms of an effective 
temperature parameter thermalizing the system. An equation of state and a topological 
analog of the energy-balance equation are obtained. The formalism of the free energy 
potential is developed, and the nature of the first order phase transition and spinodal is 
demonstrated.

1 Introduction 
Damage as a complex phenomenon has been studied by many authors and a survey of 
recent developments in damage mechanics can be found in [1-3]. Although 
temperature as a parameter could be included in consideration the models of damage 
usually don’t require its presence. Instead, the damage phenomenon is described by the 
topological stochasticity of fracture surfaces. Stochastic ‘geometric’ behavior of the 
system carries on the role of thermal fluctuations. 
A natural question arises: Can we describe the topological fluctuations in the 
system in terms of an effective temperature parameter? If the temperature is naturally 
absent but the stochastic behavior carries on its role the question above can be 
reformulated as: Can the formalism of statistical mechanics (further SM) be extended 
to non-thermal damage phenomena?  
Many attempts [4-10] have been made to answer these questions. One of the 
most brilliant approaches was suggested by Smalley et al. [11]. To model damage they 
actually used Dyson’s hierarchical model developed in SM [see 12 and furthercitations in the literature]. In spite of the great interest the application of SM to damage 
phenomena is still an unresolved question. 
This paper develops a rigorous, systematic approach to the question. It could be 
expected that the direct applications of the energy concepts of SM to topological 
phenomena are neither correct nor possible. Instead, the basic variables of statistical 
mechanics like temperature, energy, and free energy potential should be mapped on 
their topological analogs. Therefore we should start from the basic principles and 
follow a step-by-step comparison between SM and non-thermal damage phenomenon. 
In this way we could find the topological analogs of the equation of state, energy-
balance equation, and free energy potential. The knowledge of the free energy potential 
would give us a complete knowledge of the system. Particularly, the behavior of 
possible phase transitions in the system would be classified by it.  
The nature of damage phenomenon is assumed to be represented by the 
stochasticity of its topological occurrence. The equilibrium properties of this stochastic 
behavior are assumed to be prescribed as an external stochastic constraint (further 
ESC). In other words, the equilibrium probability distributions are dictated by a priori 
assigned model stochasticity. The analogy with statistical mechanics describes this 
ESC in terms of the effective temperature parameter thermalizing the system. In other 
words, stochastic fluctuations are mapped on thermal fluctuations of SM and 
prescribed ESC is mapped on the ESC of the classic canonical ensemble (temperature 
dictated by the external medium). And the main purpose of the paper remains to 
illustrate a complete similarity between SM and damage mechanics. To emphasize thisthe abbreviation ‘ASM’ will be used when the results will appear to be in a complete 
analogy with SM. 
2 Model 
Damage is a complex phenomenon. It can be associated with local and non-local load 
sharing, brittle and ductile behavior. It can emerge both in one-dimensional and three-
dimensional systems, leading in the last case to three-dimensional stress patterns of 
crack formation. The basic principles of damage are often completely disguised by the 
secondary side effects of its occurrence. 
Therefore, to develop a theory of damage as a SM phenomenon, it is reasonable 
to consider initially a simple model. So, in SM the Van der Waals’ meanfield model is 
usually used to illustrate the behavior of gas-liquid systems. In the case of magnetic 
systems an analogy is the meanfield Ising model with the infinite range of interactions. 
The basic principles of SM and phase-transition behavior can be illustrated by these 
simple models. Further models corresponding to real systems can be constructed as 
more accurate and more complex improvements. 
In this paper we will investigate the meanfield approximation of damage 
phenomena. As a model we consider a static (deterministic, quenched) fiber-bundle 
model (further FBM) with the uniform global (meanfield) load sharing. The term 
‘static’ as an opposite to the term ‘stochastic’ is used to specify that each fiber has 
a priori assigned strength threshold s which does not change during the model 
evolution, and this fiber can fail only when its stress σF exceeds its strength s. All 
fibers have predefined strengths, distributed with a priori specified probability densityfunction ps(s). The cumulative distribution function 
∫

(
)
(
 is the probability 
for a fiber to have been already broken if its stress is supposed to be σF.  
We assume that there is an ensemble of identical systems. The systems are non-
thermodynamic and thermal fluctuations are naturally absent in them. Instead, each 
system in the ensemble realizes some strength distribution over its fibers. This 
introduces stochastic topological fluctuations. The prescribed distribution Ps(s) works 
as an ESC introduced into the system as a model input. This ESC is similar to the 
temperature prescribed in a canonical ensemble. The external medium dictates the 
equilibrium distribution of probabilities for the stochastic behavior but the system 
actually can realize itself in a non-equilibrium state with any other probability 
distribution (i.e., it can fluctuate from the equilibrium with the ESC). E.g., in the 
thermal canonical ensemble a system can consume any amount of energy and only the 
equilibrium value is prescribed by the temperature. Similar, we assume that a system in 
the ensemble can realize an arbitrary distribution of fiber strengths and realizes Ps(s) 
only in the equilibrium with the ESC. The model is deterministic (static) in the sense 
that for each particular system the realization of strength distribution is assigned a 
priori and does not change during the system evolution. Therefore for the same 
realization of strength distribution the system follows during its evolution exactly the 
same deterministic trajectory. However, the model is stochastic in the sense that a 
priori assigned sample distribution of a system is prescribed stochastically and only on 
the ensemble average should correspond to Ps(s).We assume that the number of fibers in the model N is constant and infinite in 
the thermodynamic limit. Intact fibers carry all the same strain εF which is identically 
equal to the strain ε of the whole model as a ‘black box’: εF ≡ ε. The stress of each 
intact fiber is assumed to have a linear elastic dependence on the strain till the fiber 
failure: σF = EεF, where E is the Young modulus, which is assumed to be the same for 
all fibers. This introduces the concept of non-linear stress-strain dependence for the 
total model although each fiber behaves elastically till its failure.  
Order parameters in gas-liquid systems are densities of phases; in magnetic 
systems they are magnetizations of phases. Similarly to the SM approach we define 
different phases of damage as phases with different fractions of broken fibers. To do so 
it is necessary to introduce a damage parameter D as a fraction of broken fibers. If the 
total number of fibers in the model is N then the number of broken fibers is DN and the 
number of intact fibers is (1-D)N. The damage parameter D plays here a role of the 
order parameter distinguishing phases. 
For all possible states of the system (equilibrium or not) we will assume that the 
total external force acting on the system is balanced by the response force of all fibers 
– transient processes with the discontinuity of boundary force are not considered in this 
paper. Then if we, as an external observer, were to look at the model as at a ‘black box’ 
we would not to know how many fibers are broken inside and we would see that the 
external force F is applied to N fibers, creating inform ‘virtual’ stress σ at the model 
surface. The actual stress in fibers is 1 / (1 - D) times higher due to the fiber failure andstress redistribution. Therefore, the virtual stress of the model (how an external 
observer sees it) is σ = (1 - D)σF or 
σ = (1 - D)Eε. 
(1) 
Under the condition of fixed number of particles liquid-gas and magnetic 
systems have two field parameters outside of coexistence region: these could be 
temperature and volume/magnetization, or temperature and pressure/magnetic field, or 
any other pair of independent variables. In the case of FBM strain ε or stress σ could be 
chosen to be a field parameter. However, in contrast to other systems, only one of these 
parameters is independent. ‘Geometric’ constraint (1) and an equation of state make 
two of three parameters D, ε, σ dependent. Therefore we would preliminary expect that 
an analog of the energy-balance equation for the FBM must have one term less.  
In SM a system has a phase space of microstates along which it wonders 
jumping from one microstate to another in accordance with the assigned probabilities 
of each microstate. In general, the system can reach any macrostate of all possible, and 
only the long waiting time makes the non-equilibrium states unobservable. Another 
formulation is a concept of ensemble of identical systems. An observer can 
simultaneously watch different microstates as realizations of different copies of the 
initial system. An ergodic hypothesis claims that these two different approaches are 
equivalent: in the ensemble at a given time the observer sees each state realized with 
the same probability as it would be in the case of observations of only one system for 
the long time.However, in the case of the FBM without healing (which is under the 
consideration) we have only one possibility – an ensemble of identical systems. Each 
realization of the model has a priori prescribed strength distribution which does not 
change during the system evolution. Therefore, for the given value of constant strain or 
stress the system has failed in one particular way and will never visit other microstates. 
So, only ensemble analogy with SM is possible for the FBM. 
3 Definition of a microstate, macrostate, and equilibrium state 
In the case of gas-liquid systems microstates are defined as cells in the phase space of 
the system. In the case of magnetic systems microstates are defined as different 
realizations of “up” and “down” spins on a lattice: ↑↑↓↓↑. We can define microstates 
for the FBM in an analogous way as different realizations of broken and intact fibers. 
So, for the FBM with N = 3 fibers all possible microstates are |||, ||x, |x|, x||, |xx, x|x, 
xx|, and xxx where symbol ‘|’ denotes an intact fiber while symbol ‘x’ – a broken fiber. 
Further in the paper index n will be used to enumerate all possible microstates. A 
similarity with the Ising model should be mentioned here because each spin or fiber is 
fixed at a particular location of the lattice and all fibers are macroscopic objects. 
Therefore in contrast to particles, they should not be considered as identical 
(indistinguishable) objects.  
For the specified damage D and for the external boundary constraints (further 
EBC) ε = const or σ = const each microstate has probability

as the probability that (1 - D)N fibers are intact and DN fibers are broken. This 
probability

 is dictated by the ESC Ps(s). Again, this ESC is similar to the 
temperature prescribed in a canonical ensemble. The external medium dictates the 
equilibrium distribution of probabilities but the system actually can realize itself in a 
non-equilibrium state with any other probability distribution wn. Only the equilibrium 
state is dictated by the ESC therefore we used abbreviation ‘equil’ to emphasize that 
this probability distribution corresponds to the equilibrium with the ESC.  
In general, a macrostate may be defined as a union of all possible microstates 
realized with the specified probabilities. However, in this paper a simpler definition 
will be used when these probabilities equal only zero or unity. In other words, further 
in this paper as to a macrostate we will refer to a subset of microstates chosen by a 
particular property. For example, the definition of a macrostate in a thermal canonical 
ensemble is a subset of all microstates with the specified energy. For the FBM we will 
presumably use the definition of a macrostate as a subset of all microstates with the 
specified fraction of broken fibers, i.e., with the specified damage D. If another 
definition of a macrostate shall be utilized it will be clearly specified. 
All microstates corresponding to the macrostate D have the same probability (2)

Everywhere further the symbol “≈ln” will mean the accuracy of exponential

for the EBC σ = const. This is the probability for the macrostate D to be observed in 
equilibrium with the ESC.  
For the equilibrium we will use two different definitions which are often 
confused in the literature. The ESC is assumed to prescribe the equilibrium probability 
distribution 
equil
n
w
 for all microstates. Therefore, the equilibrium with the ESC could be 
identified with a system which can realize itself on all microstates with equilibriumprobabilities: 
equil
n
n
w
w =
. In other words, all microstates are possible but their 
probabilities are dictated by the ESC. As an example we could think of the equilibrium 
in a thermal canonical ensemble where all microstates with all energies are possible but 
their probabilities are dictated by Boltzmann distribution. The superscript ‘equil’ will 
be used for this definition. Then the value of any quantity f in equilibrium by definition 
is 
∑
≡
n
n
equil
n
equil
f
w
f
. 
In contrast, another definition is the equilibrium (most probable) macrostate, i.e., 
a system that can realize itself only on (that is isolated on) a subset of microstates 
corresponding to the most probable macrostate. This is the macrostate which gives the 
main contribution to the partition function. As an example we could think of the 
equilibrium macrostate of the thermal canonical ensemble where we count only those 
microstates whose energies equal to the equilibrium value E0 = NkBT / 2. To distinguish 
this case the subscript ‘0’ will be used. 
4 Why we cannot directly apply the SM formalism 
The FBM is not a thermal system and it has topological fluctuation instead of 
thermal fluctuations. Temperature is naturally absent in this system. Therefore the 
methods of SM cannot be applied directly and have to be developed independently. For 
example, under constant stress and constant temperature conditions it would not be 
correct to say that the free energy potential of the system (whose minimization gives an 
equilibrium state) is the Gibbs free energy G defined in the traditional way G = E –
 TS - Vσε where E is the energy of the system. The FBM model does not have 
temperature or energy-balance equation. Therefore SM is not applicable here directly.Another incorrect method would be the minimization of entropy as it is done in 
SM. One of definitions of entropy is given by

where wn is the probability of microstate n and the sum goes over all microstates (here 
and further Boltzmann constant is omitted for the formulas of SM and is absent 
naturally for the FBM formulas). For the FBM this formula can be rewritten as

(6) 
where we have accumulated the summation over all microstates corresponding to the 
specified D by the number of these microstates 
macro
D
N
 due to the fact that all these 
microstates have equal probabilities w(D) given by Eq. (2).  
For an isolated system the negative entropy is the free energy potential and the 
equilibrium state can be found by the maximization of entropy over all possible values 
of microstate probabilities wn. The method of Lagrange multipliers is used with the 
single EBC prescribed for the system that the sum of probabilities of all microstates 
must be equal to unity: 
1
=
∑
n
n
w
. Then the maximization gives equal probabilities 
equil
n
w
 
for all microstates.  
For a canonical ensemble a correct equilibrium state is usually found by adding 
an additional EBC prescribed to the system: the mean energy must be equal to the 
energy, dictated by the medium: 
0

. It should be said however that this 
condition is irrelevant for the canonical ensemble (because nothing restricts the systemto consume any energy) and is in situ only an artificial trick to obtain the result by the 
maximization of entropy. With this trick the maximization of entropy gives the correct 
Gibbs distribution 
equil
n

. However, a better way to obtain this result would be to say 
that for the canonical ensemble (constant temperature and constant volume) the free 
energy

For the FBM this method mustn’t be used because the maximization of 
microstate probabilities wn must include the ESC Ps(s) as an additional EBC. In other 
words, we must minimize the free energy over probabilities wn with the constraints

. So, the relative fluctuations of D are inversely 
proportional to the square root of the number of fibers N (N is infinite in the

. The fact that the maximum is very 
narrow gives us a possibility (ASM) to calculate all quantities averaged over D as their 
values at the point of the maximum: fequil ≈ f(D0). For example, the averaged damage 
parameter in the equilibrium equals to its value at the maximum: Dequil ≈ D0.  
Is it possible for fluctuations to overwhelm the damping factor

It should be mentioned that the entropy given by Eqs. (9-10, 12-13) is the 
statistical, topological entropy and must not be confused with the thermodynamic 
entropy. In the literature it is often to multiply Eq. (12) by the Boltzmann constant kB 
and to use this quantity in the energy-balance equation as the thermodynamic entropy. 
The incorrectness of this approach can be easy illustrated by the following example. 
Let’s assume that only one fiber is broken. In this case the entropy given by Eq. (12) 
and multiplied by kB is 
N
k
S
B ln
 ≈ 
. If the number of fibers is high but finite, e.g., 
N = e10, the product of the entropy and temperature TS has an order of the energy of 
10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, the surface energy and elastic energy of the broken 
fiber as a macroscopic object have the order of the Avogadro constant (1023 time 
higher). Therefore, it is irrelevant to use the obtained expression of entropy in the 
energy-balance equation because the entropy given by Eq. (12) does not represent the 
thermodynamic entropy. Instead, a new, ‘topological’ analog of the energy-balance 
equation must be constructed as we will see below.6 Equation of state for the constant stress σ = const as an EBC 
Let us first consider a simple example. For the EBC of constant strain we had 
σ = (1-D0)Eε = (1-Ps(Eε))Eε for the virtual stress at the model boundary. Its derivative 
is

. The equation of state can be easy 
obtained. For any values of parameters s1 and s2 the virtual stress σ has a linear 
dependence on strain ε in the range 0 < Eε < s1. This is the elastic behavior of the 
model till the first fiber failure. If s2 ≤ 2s1 then after the strain ε exceeds value s1/E the 
stress monotonically decreases with the further increase of the strain. Instability

 means that for the EBC of constant stress the non-elastic branch of 
the stress curve is always unstable and a complete rupture follows the first fiber failure. 
However, if s2 > 2s1 then the stress with the further increase of strain increases initially, 
comes to the point where

as it is shown in Fig. 2. However, in the case of the constant strain Eq. (7) has only one 
solution as the direct dependence of D on ε (DA corresponds to εA and DB corresponds 
to εB) and for any value of constant strain the probability

 for this case is given in Fig. 4c. The fluctuations are no more Gaussian and 
the relative fluctuations become proportional to

N . This behavior is typical for the 
spinodal point in the meanfield Landau’s theory (ASM) and its applicability to the 
FBM model seems to be natural because the model we discuss is the meanfield model. 
For the case of a FBM with the local stress redistribution in the vicinity of the point S 
the size of fluctuations in the system would have power-law divergence which would 
correspond to the infinite correlation length (ASM). Therefore, under the EBC of the 
constant stress the system has a spinodal point and the damage in the system exhibits 
properties of the first order phase transition A → B → F.We have found three independent equilibrium values of damage parameter DA, 
DB, and DF for the dependence

three values should be stable. However, we know that the equilibrium DA is in situ

 there. It is 
again in the complete analogy with the Van der Waals’ meanfield model for the gas-
liquid system. The exact solution of the homogeneous meanfield Van der Waals’ 
model also gives the metastable and unstable branches of the isothermal pressure-
volume dependence. The reason is that the constructed model is a priori homogeneous. 
Only introduction of the Maxwell’s rule for heterogeneous liquid-gas transition allows 
substituting the unstable branch by the stable coexistence of two phases. The case of 
the FBM is similar. Our model is a priori meanfield homogeneous model. Therefore its 
exact solution exhibits the presence of the unstable branch. Only introduction of 
heterogeneity into the system would allow substituting this branch by the stable 
Maxwell’s solution. If we were to imagine a heterogeneous FBM with local range of 
stress transfer we would have a heterogeneous mixture of intact and broken states A 
and F. It is illustrated in Fig. 3. Curve 0 - S is metastable, curve S – B - G is unstable, 
and the Maxwell’s rule is given by the straight line A - B - F. Here point F represents 
the infinity of the strain therefore actually curve A – B - F should be thought as a 
horizontal line to infinity.  
So, we have found that under the EBC of constant stress the FBM exhibits 
presence of the first order phase transition and spinodal. However, as it will be shown 
further, the classification of phase transitions is controversial because the continuity ofthe free energy potential strongly depends on the choice of the free energy potential 
itself. Some potentials, although they acquire a minimum at equilibrium, can be 
continuous even in the case of the first order phase transitions. This will be illustrated 
by Eq. (24) in the next paragraph. 
7 Temperature and free energy potential 
To construct the free energy potential it is necessary to discuss first the derivation of 
the free energy potential in SM. First we consider a thermodynamic system isolated 
with the given energy E. In the energy spectrum of the system some g(E) degenerated 
levels correspond to this value of energy E. As to degenerated levels we will for 
simplicity refer to the groups of levels with close values of energies. For the case of an 
ideal system without interactions it is possible to think of the exact degeneracy in the 
sense of quantum mechanics.  
So, only g(E) microstates are possible for the isolated system. The equilibrium 
probability of each microstate is

Here g(E) is the number of microstates ΔΓ over which the system can realize itself

For the isolated system we have to use another definition of a macrostate: We

. Again, the negative entropy of the non-
equilibrium macrostates can be chosen as the free energy potential. 
Of course, our systems are non-Hamiltonian and the concept of energy is not 
applicable to them. Therefore we would suggest in future to use the term ‘ruling’ or 
‘governing’ potential instead of ‘free energy’ potential. Or, being consistent with Sinai-
Bowen-Ruelle’s terminology [13, 15, 16], the term ‘topological’ or ‘stochastic’ 
potential could be used. However, to be consistent the term ‘free energy’ potential will 
be used till the end of the paper.Phenomenological approach for an isolated system claims that the entropy of the 
isolated system can only increase:

For any equilibrium state this potential identically equals to zero. Therefore its

introduce another free energy potential whose derivatives could be non-zero. Therefore 
the criterion to distinguish first and continuous phase transitions strongly depends on 
the choice of the free energy potential.

Imagine now a system in the canonical ensemble during its evolution over non-

thought as a system isolated with the energy E. Therefore, the increase of the entropy

Therefore, we have confirmed that the Helmholtz energy is the free energy potential in 
the case of the canonical ensemble. 
The behavior of the FBM under the EBC ε = const is analogous to the behavior 
of the canonical ensemble and the damage parameter D plays a role of the energy E.

The temperature here is a constant for the external constraint ε = const and therefore 
could be used as an EBC too. Actually, two EBCs ε = const or T = const are equivalent 
and could be used intermittently.  
Of course, the term ‘temperature’ here has nothing to do with the energy 
characteristics of the system and reflects only the similarity of statistics with SM. 
Therefore we would suggest naming it ‘topological’ temperature.

. So, 
we see that in general case the balance equation could be obtained by the 
differentiation of the non-equilibrium entropy. Peculiar here is the fact that for the 
general case the equation of topological balance depends actually only on the 
degeneration of macrostates D given by Eq. (3) and does not depend on the equilibrium 
probability distribution given by Eq. (2). Therefore, only the structure of the system 
itself determines the balance equation and the ESC does not influence it. However, this 
constraint defines the equilibrium state and in this way (1 / T in Eqs. (27) and (36)) 
determines how the balance equation would look like in the equilibrium with this ESC. 
So, for the general case the balance inequality is

stress-strain ratio

This is the most general case of the balance inequality for the FBM with the fixed 
number of fibers. 
9 Conclusion 
An introduction of the model stochasticity as an external stochastic constraint 
(ESC) introduces fluctuating topological behavior into a system. For the FBM it is 
shown that these fluctuations ‘statistically’ thermalize in general a non-thermal system. 
The equilibrium ‘canonical’ distribution of probabilities is dictated by the ESC instead 
of the temperature of the external media. The formalism of the classical statistical 
mechanics is developed providing all classical features like the narrow probability 
maximum, free energy potential, balance equation, and equation of state. This gives 
rise to the new statistical mechanics, statistical mechanics of damage. 
Behavior of the system exhibits the presence of a critical point and continuous 
phase transition in its vicinity. Apart from the critical point the system has the first 
order phase transition. However, the classification of the order of phase transition is 
shown to be controversial and is based on the choice of the free energy potential.
