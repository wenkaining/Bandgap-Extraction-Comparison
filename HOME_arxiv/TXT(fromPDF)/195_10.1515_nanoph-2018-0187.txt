Magneto-optical spectroscopy based on the transverse magneto-optical
Kerr eﬀect (TMOKE) is a sensitive method for investigation of
magnetically-ordered media.
However, in magnetic materials the
optical transitions are usually characterized by spectrally broad res-
onances with widths considerably exceeding the Zeeman splitting
in the magnetic ﬁeld. Here we investigate experimentally and the-
oretically the TMOKE in the vicinity of relatively narrow optical
resonances provided by conﬁned quantum systems. For experimen-
1
arXiv:1810.13344v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  31 Oct 2018tal demonstration we use the exciton resonance in a (Cd,Mn)Te
diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum well, where the strong
exchange interaction with magnetic ions enables the giant Zeeman
splitting of exciton spin states ∆in magnetic ﬁelds of a few Tesla. In
the weak coupling regime, when the splitting ∆is smaller than the
spectral broadening of the optical transitions Γ, the TMOKE mag-
nitude grows linearly with the increase of the Zeeman splitting and
its spectrum has an S-shape, which remains virtually unchanged in
this range. In the strong coupling regime (∆> Γ) the TMOKE mag-
nitude saturates, while its spectrum is strongly modiﬁed resulting
in the appearance of two separate peaks.
The TMOKE is sensi-
tive not only to the sample surface but can be used to probe the
conﬁned electronic states in depth if the upper layer is suﬃciently
transparent.
Our results demonstrate that TMOKE of spectrally
narrow resonances serves as a versatile tool for probing the charge
and spin structure of electronic states in various conﬁned quantum
systems and can be used for spin tomography in combination with
the conventional polar Kerr eﬀect.
2The transverse magneto-optical Kerr eﬀect (TMOKE) is one of the magneto-optical ef-
fects that emerge due to the Zeeman splitting of the electron levels in magnetic ﬁeld [1].
Contrary to the widely used Faraday eﬀect, the TMOKE is sensitive to the spin com-
ponent orthogonal to the light propagation direction and is usually used to detect the
in-plane magnetization of para- and ferromagnetic materials [2–5].
Furthermore, TMOKE is an intensity eﬀect of an incident light beam that is deﬁned
by the relative change of reﬂectance R, for the two opposite directions of an in-plane
magnetic ﬁeld B:
δ = 2R(B) −R(−B)
R(B) + R(−B).
(1)
TMOKE appears only for oblique light incidence with the magnetic ﬁeld orthogonal to
the incidence plane and in a frequency range where the medium’s absorption is non-
vanishing [1]. As TMOKE is related to the modiﬁcation of boundary conditions for the
incident light by the magnetic ﬁeld, it is valuable for investigation of magnetic properties
near the sample’s interface [2, 3].
If the boundary conditions at two interfaces of a
thin magnetic ﬁlm are diﬀerent, the transmitted light intensity becomes magnetization
dependent as well [6].
Usually, TMOKE is observed for ferromagnetic metals in the visible and infrared
spectral range, where it has a typical value of δ ≈10−3 and a weak spectral dependence [7].
In dielectric materials the oﬀ-resonant TMOKE in the transparency range is very weak
due to the negligible absorption. However, resonant TMOKE with notable magnitude may
be present even in nearly transparent media in the vicinity of the absorption band which
is provided by spectrally narrow optical resonances. Such phenomenon has been recently
actively studied in hybrid magneto-photonic structures where the optical resonances are
represented by electromagnetic modes such as surface plasmon polaritons [8, 9], waveguide
modes [10, 11] or optical Tamm states [12].
It was demonstrated that the TMOKE
3is drastically enhanced in hybrid metal-dielectric structures at the resonance of surface
plasmon-polaritons [8, 13–16] and reaches up to δ = 0.15 (see Ref.17). Nevertheless, due to
the strong absorption in metals the bandwidth of the plasmonic resonances Γ signiﬁcantly
exceeds the Zeeman splitting ∆, so that the ratio ∆/Γ ≪1 holds. In this case the spectral
dependence of TMOKE has a characteristic S-shape around the plasmonic resonance: it
possesses maxima and minima at the slopes of the resonance and crosses zero at the
central frequency.
Further types of optical resonances are represented, for instance, by conﬁned quantum
states such as rare earth ions in dielectrics, or excitons in semiconductors. These optical
resonances are much narrower as compared to plasmonic excitations.
Therefore, the
fundamentally new strong coupling regime with ∆/Γ ≥1 can be established, where
the exciton damping Γ is slower as compared to its spin precession in a magnetic ﬁeld.
Consequently the Zeeman splitting is observed in reﬂectivity, in contrast to the weak
coupling regime with ∆/Γ ≤1. Surprisingly, TMOKE was not yet studied in this regime
irrespective of the studied system.
In this work we reveal TMOKE in the vicinity of narrow optical resonances which orig-
inate from excitons. For demonstration purposes we focus on excitons in diluted magnetic
semiconductor (DMS) quantum well (QW) structures. Here the exchange interaction of
magnetic ions with the conduction band electrons (s −d) and valence band holes (p −d)
allows to achieve a large exciton Zeeman splitting with ∆/Γ > 1 already in moderate
magnetic ﬁelds [18–20]. In particular, we demonstrate the enhancement of TMOKE in
the vicinity of exciton resonances in a 10 nm-thick (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW.
In what follows, ﬁrst, we consider the TMOKE theoretically for a generic three-level
system and conﬁrm that the TMOKE features observed at the exciton resonance are
inherent to a broad class of optical resonances caused by conﬁned quantum states. Sec-
4ond, we demonstrate resonant TMOKE for spectrally narrow excitonic resonances in a
(Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW structure.
Results
Theory of TMOKE near the resonance of a three-level system.
In order to
identify the general properties of the TMOKE in the vicinity of a spectrally narrow
optical resonance let us theoretically study the TMOKE in a simpliﬁed magneto-optical
model for the electric dipole optical transitions in a three level quantum system, which
is realized in a large variety of atomic, molecular and solid-state objects with pseudospin
in the excited or ground state [21–23]. In particular, one example of such systems is
represented by a single level in the ground state (g) which is coupled through the optical
ﬁeld to two excited states (e, with pseudospin projection Sy = ±1
2). The latter are split
due to the Zeeman eﬀect. The selection rules for optical transitions dictate that excitation
with an electromagnetic wave, which possesses σ+ circular polarization in the xz-plane,
addresses the state with angular momentum projection Sy = +1
2 and correspondingly
Sy = −1
2 for σ−polarization. Due to the Zeeman splitting, ∆, their energies are split
from the central one E0 by ∆/2: E = E0 ± ∆/2 (see Fig. 1a).
These transitions cause resonances in the permittivity tensor ϵij = ϵδij −ieijkgk, where gk
is the gyration vector, eijk is the Levi-Civita tensor, and i, j, k = x, y, z [1]. In the case of
the magnetic ﬁeld directed along the y-axis the permittivity tensor components are:

where E is the energy, ϵb is the background permittivity, d is the matrix element of the
electron transition dipole moment and Γ is the damping.
5Relatively simple analytical expressions for TMOKE (Eq. (S1) in Supplementary) can
be obtained for the light reﬂection from a semi-inﬁnite magnetic medium. The principle
scheme of the considered geometry of the light incidence, and the applied magnetic ﬁeld
is shown in Fig. 1b.
We start the asymptotic analysis of Eq. (S1) for the weak coupling regime (∆/Γ ≪1)
which gives the following expression for TMOKE (see Supplementary, Eq. (S2)):
δ = −8Ed∆Γ tan θ

where we deﬁne the energy related to the dipole moment as Ed = 4π|d|2/ϵb, and we
introduce eE = (E0 −E) + Ed(1 +
1
2(ϵb−1)) and a =
1
2(ϵb−1)Ed. Here and below we assume
that the incidence angle θ is small enough so that we can neglect tan2 θ with respect
to ϵb. As follows from Eqs. (2) and (3) the TMOKE is proportional to the damping Γ
and exists only within the spectral range where the imaginary part of the permittivity
is not vanishing. In this sense, it is similar to the eﬀect of magnetic dichroism. The
TMOKE grows linearly with ∆and its spectrum has an antisymmetric S-shape with
respect to E = E0 + Ed(1 +

2(ϵb−1)) (see Fig. 2a). The TMOKE has a maximum and a
minimum spectrally separated by Γ. The magnitudes of the TMOKE extrema are directly
proportional to the Zeeman splitting ∆:
δ = ∓3

At the same time the shape of the TMOKE spectrum does not change with the magnetic
ﬁeld for ∆/Γ ≪1.
Narrow optical resonances in suﬃciently large magnetic ﬁelds lead to the other limiting
case when ∆/Γ ≫1. Analysing the general expression for TMOKE (Eq. (S1)) we should
take into account that the resonances of TMOKE are located at |E0−E| = ∆/2. We treat
6Γ/∆as a small parameter and derive the analytical expression for the TMOKE peaks in

Minus refers to E0 −E > 0, and positive TMOKE corresponds to E0 −E < 0. TMOKE
spectra for the strong coupling regime are presented in Fig. 2b. Contrary to the previ-
ous situation of weak coupling, the relatively large magnetic ﬁeld changes the shape of
the TMOKE spectrum when ∆> Γ: it comprises two separate peaks of opposite sign,
the energy distance between the peaks corresponds to the Zeeman splitting ∆and con-
sequently increases with the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Another interesting feature of the
strong coupling regime is the fact that the TMOKE peaks’ magnitude experiences sat-
uration. When ∆and Γ are almost equal, one can see that the TMOKE peaks behave
like in the weak coupling regime, and the maximal TMOKE gradually grows. However,
this initial increase of TMOKE ceases, when the ratio ∆/Γ exceeds about 5. Now the
relatively large Zeeman splitting approximation is fulﬁlled. Henceforth, the maximum
value of TMOKE does not depend on ∆. Similarly to the weak coupling regime, the
dependence of TMOKE on the incidence angle is linear as one can see from Eq. (5).
Thus, in large magnetic ﬁelds, when the Zeeman splitting exceeds the resonance linewidth,
one can observe novel features that do not exist in case of small magnetic ﬁelds. Namely,
the TMOKE spectrum’s shape changes with magnetic ﬁeld: it has two peaks of opposite
sign and these peaks move away from each other with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. More-
over, on the contrary to the weak coupling regime, the peaks’ magnitude does not depend
on the applied magnetic ﬁeld. These general features have been ascertained for the sim-
plest case when the p-polarized beam is reﬂected from a semi-inﬁnite magnetic material
with one narrow resonance. For more complex systems additional peculiarities emerge,
7nevertheless, preserving the general properties discussed above.
As conﬁned quantum states can be formed not only near the sample surface but also at
some region in the bulk (e.g. in the QW inside a semiconductor sample with a cap layer),
it is important to consider the case when the magneto-optical resonance appears in a thin
layer buried at some distance from the sample surface. Though TMOKE is considered
as a surface sensitive eﬀect, in this case it can be useful for probing conﬁned resonances
in depth. For this purpose we analyse a trilayer structure composed of: the cap layer of
varying thickness, the 10 nm-thick QW layer with the dielectric permittivity tensor given
by Eq. (2) and the buﬀer layer (see Fig. 3a). Variation of the cap layer thickness modiﬁes
the shape of the TMOKE resonance with a period of 120 nm which is half of the light’s
wavelength in the cap layer (Fig. 2c). Additionally one can achieve a fully antisymmetric
TMOKE spectral shape as it occurs for the 90 nm cap layer.
The TMOKE features discussed above can be observed in diﬀerent systems that posses
sharp optical resonances originating from conﬁned quantum states. In the next section we
concentrate on the experimental demonstration of these features for the case of exciton
resonances in magnetic semiconductor QW structures.
TMOKE at the exciton resonance in semiconductor quantum well. To inves-
tigate the TMOKE mediated by excitons in diluted magnetic semiconductors, we use a
sample with a QW structure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on a (001) oriented GaAs
substrate. The 10 nm-thick DMS Cd0.974Mn0.026Te QW layer is sandwiched between non
magnetic Cd0.73Mg0.27Te barriers (buﬀer and cap layers) (see Methods and Fig. 3a). The
TMOKE measurements were performed in two regimes: (i) The weak coupling regime
in magnetic ﬁeld of B = 580 mT at a temperature T ≈10 K; (ii) The strong coupling
regime where the magnetic ﬁeld was varied in 125 mT steps from 0.5 to 5.0 T at T = 2 K.
For the ﬁrst case the TMOKE spectra were obtained in a wide range of incidence angles
8using a Fourier imaging setup. In the second case the measurements were performed for
θ = 5◦. In both cases the magnetic ﬁeld was oriented in the QW plane and perpendicular
to the plane of light incidence as it is shown in Fig. 3a. The details on the measurement
procedure and evaluation of TMOKE spectra are presented in the Methods section.
TMOKE in the weak coupling regime. Figure 4 summarizes the data obtained in the
weak coupling regime of excitonic states. Reﬂection spectra of the structure show oscil-
lations related to the interference of light after multiple reﬂections within the (Cd,Mg)Te
buﬀer layer (solid curve in Fig. 4a). The exciton resonance from the DMS QW is repre-
sented by a weak feature in the reﬂection spectrum at a photon energy of around 1.683 eV.
In contrast, the TMOKE spectrum presented in Fig. 4b at θ = 5◦shows a much more
abundant picture with two resonances located at 1.683 and 1.701 eV. This result high-
lights the sensitivity of TMOKE spectroscopy.
The presence of two exciton resonances in the TMOKE spectrum of the DMS QW struc-
ture is related to the quantization of carriers inside the QW as well as uniaxial strain
in the direction along the normal to the QW [24]. For that reason the light-hole and
heavy-hole exciton resonances, which are degenerate in a bulk crystal, split into the
light-hole (lh) state with Elh(B = 0) = 1.701 eV and the heavy-hole (hh) state with
Ehh(B = 0) = 1.683 eV. The corresponding energies are marked by dotted vertical lines
in Figs. 4a,b. The light-heavy-hole splitting is equal to ∆lh = 18 meV. Both TMOKE
resonances are observed for oblique incidence near the frequencies of the corresponding
transitions from the hole states and have antisymmetric S-shape. The exciton mediated
TMOKE grows with increase of the incidence angle, reaching 1.1% at θ = 20◦(Fig. 4c),
which is several orders of magnitude larger than the oﬀ-resonant value of 0.01%, observed
at θ = 20◦and 1.578 eV.
9We emphasize that the light-hole exciton feature in the photoluminescence and reﬂectivity
spectra is too weak to determine the position of the resonance which is mainly due to its
fast relaxation into the ground state corresponding to the heavy-hole exciton. In contrast
to that, the TMOKE spectrum can be used to determine the positions of both exciton
resonances. Interestingly, the strength of TMOKE is about twice larger for light-hole
excitons than for the heavy-hole state and the sign of the eﬀect is opposite. In other
words, for positive incidence angles θ the TMOKE magnitude for the lh exciton changes
from positive to negative values with increasing photon energy E (rising S-shape), while
for the hh exciton an opposite behaviour with falling S-shape is observed, as shown in
Fig. 4b.
Heavy-hole excitons show a smaller magnitude of TMOKE because at zero magnetic ﬁeld
the corresponding transitions are linearly polarized in the QW plane and hence carry zero
spin along the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Hence, the TMOKE for the heavy-hole resonance
is enabled only due to the admixture of light-hole states at non-zero magnetic ﬁeld. That
explains why the heavy-hole TMOKE remains relatively weak until the Zeeman splitting
becomes comparable with the light-heavy-hole splitting. It also hints to the origin of the
diﬀerent sign for light-holes and heavy-holes that will be explained more intuitively once
we consider higher magnetic ﬁelds.
Now we proceed to a quantitative description of the TMOKE resonance for hybridized
light-hole and heavy-hole states at weak magnetic ﬁeld. To that end we have calculated
the eﬀective permittivity tensor of the QW. The orbital eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld,
that can mix light-hole and heavy-hole resonances and induce spatial dispersion [25],
were neglected. In the case of a DMS structure these eﬀects are less important than
the Mn-mediated giant Zeeman splitting. The resulting QW permittivity tensor can be
presented as ϵ = ϵb(1 + χhh + χlh), with the heavy-hole and light-hole susceptibilities
10in the xz subspace (Ox is in the QW plane and perpendicular to the external ﬁeld and
Oz is normal to the QW plane, see Fig. 3a). The susceptibilities read (see section B of
Supplementary Materials for the derivation details):

Here, Dν ≡Eν −E −iΓν; Eν and Γν are the exciton resonance energy and width, the
index ν = lh, hh, (lh, ±), (hh, ±) labels zero-ﬁeld and Zeeman-split excitonic transition
energies (see also Fig. 3c) and ωLT is the eﬀective longitudinal-transverse splitting. The
parameter Z depends linearly on the magnetic ﬁeld being responsible for the light-heavy-
hole mixing.
It is determined by the ratio of the Zeeman splitting of the heavy-hole
state in the Faraday conﬁguration ∆h,F to the light-heavy-hole splitting ∆lh. For the
experimentally relevant case of B = 580 mT it is equal to |Z| ≈0.3. In the general case
one has Z = N0βxSBS/∆lh, where N0β = −0.88 eV is the p −d exchange interaction
constant, S = 5/2 is the Mn spin, x is the concentration of Mn2+ ions and BS(ε) is the
modiﬁed Brillouin function describing the magnetization of Mn ions at given magnetic
ﬁeld and temperature [18–20, 26].
For S = 5/2 the argument of BS(ε) is deﬁned as
ε = 5µBgMnB/2kBTeﬀwith the Bohr magneton µB, the Boltzmann constant kB, the Land´e
factor of Mn2+ ion gMn = 2.01 and the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ= T + T0. The speciﬁc
parameters of the investigated structure x ≈0.026 and T0 ≈1.5 K were evaluated from
the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of heavy-hole exciton splitting in the Faraday geometry
∆h,F measured using photoluminescence spectroscopy [27].
The TMOKE response is described by the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the susceptibilities (6).
The diﬀerent signs before these elements for light-holes and heavy-holes reﬂect diﬀerent
signs of the TMOKE response. Because of the term ∝(Elh,−−Elh,+)/Dlh, for light-
11holes TMOKE is possible even when the mixing with the heavy-holes is neglected, i.e.
Z →0.
Note that the mixing term Z is determined solely by the energy structure
of the valence band states, i.e. proportional to ∆h,F/∆lh, while the energy splitting of
the exciton resonances is governed by the Zeeman splitting of both valence band and
conduction band states as it is shown in Fig. 3b,c. The contribution from the electrons is
given by ∆e = N0αxSBS, where N0α = 0.22 eV is the s−d exchange interaction constant
between the conduction band electrons and Mn2+ ions in (Cd,Mn)Te. The corresponding
splittings for light-hole and heavy-hole excitons are given by ∆X,ν = Eν,+ −Eν,−+ ∆e
with ν = lh, hh, respectively. A detailed description of the magnetic ﬁeld induced splitting
of exciton resonances in the Voigt geometry is given in section B of the Supplementary
Materials.
Using the transfer matrix method for multilayer DMS structures with the QW described
by Eq. (6), we calculated the reﬂectance and TMOKE spectra. They show good agree-
ment with the experimental data if Elh = 1.7005 eV and Ehh = 1.6825 eV are assumed
(dashed curves in Fig. 4a,b). The longitudinal-transverse splitting is ℏωLT = 0.65 meV
while the linewidth and Zeeman splitting of both resonances are Γhh = Γlh = 2.4 meV,
∆X,hh = 1.2 meV and ∆X,lh = 4.3 meV.
Therefore, in the external magnetic ﬁeld of
580 mT ∆is of the order of Γ, and in Fig. 4(b,c) we deal with the weak coupling regime.
TMOKE in the strong coupling regime. As the exciton resonances are quite narrow
the strong coupling regime (∆/Γ ≫1) is already reachable in magnetic ﬁelds of several
Tesla, i.e. if the temperature is kept low enough (T = 2 K) that the ratio ∆/Γ exceeds 5
at B = 2 T and is about 10 at B = 5 T.
The TMOKE spectra and their dependence on magnetic ﬁeld strength up to 5 T for θ = 5◦
are presented in Fig. 5. It follows that for ∆/Γ ≫1 each of the resonant TMOKE fea-
12tures corresponding to heavy and light-hole excitons at B = 0 split into two resonance
features. The splitting increases with the increase of B. Remarkably, the TMOKE max-
imum/minimum values are saturated at B = 1 T and remain constant for higher ﬁelds.
Consequently, in this regime the magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuences the shape of the TMOKE spec-
trum but does not increase its value of δ = 0.5 %.
In order to interpret the four branches in the TMOKE spectra at higher B let us consider
the case of the Zeeman energy which overcomes the light-heavy-hole splitting (Z ≫1) in
magnetic ﬁelds higher than 1 T (see Fig. 3). In this regime a simple qualitative picture
can be considered which is realized in a bulk (Cd,Mn)Te crystal. In Voigt conﬁguration
(B ∥Oy) the Zeeman-split electron states are characterized by the spin projection Se,y =
±1/2 representing a doublet. The valence band states split into a quartet with Zeeman
energy governed by the total angular momentum projection on the magnetic ﬁeld direction
Jh,y = ±1/2, ±3/2. Note that the case of strong magnetic ﬁeld is fundamentally diﬀerent
from the case of weak magnetic ﬁeld where the quantization axis is given by the QW
conﬁnement potential and therefore the energies of the valence band states are mainly
determined by the normal projection of the angular momentum Jh,z = ±1/2, ±3/2 for
light-holes and heavy-holes, respectively.
Neglecting the QW conﬁnement the splittings of conduction and valence band states
are given by ∆e = 2N0αx |Se,y| BS and ∆h = −2
3N0βx |Je,y| BS, respectively. Thus, we
obtain four σ polarized exciton transitions. The energy splitting between the outer heavy-
like hole components ∆out = ∆h + ∆e correspond to the excitonic states | ± 3/2, ±1/2⟩
written in the |Jh,y, Se,y⟩notation. The inner components are split by ∆in = ∆h/3 −∆e
corresponding to light-hole-like exciton resonances | ± 1/2, ∓1/2⟩. As follows from Fig. 5
the splitting ∆out ≈70 meV, while ∆in is about 8 times smaller at B = 5 T. According
to the s −d and p −d exchange constants in bulk (Cd,Mn)Te the relation ∆out > ∆in > 0
13holds [20].
In this case the two optical transitions with lower energy | −3/2, −1/2⟩
and | −1/2, +1/2⟩are σ+ polarized in the xz-plane, while the upper energy transitions
|+3/2, +1/2⟩and |+1/2, −1/2⟩have opposite σ−polarization (see also Fig. 3c). The form
of the S-shape resonances in large magnetic ﬁeld is in full accord with this considerations:
it has a rising slope for the low energy exciton transitions at 1.666 and 1.688 eV and
changes to falling for the higher energy resonances at 1.696 and 1.733 eV.
This also
explains the opposite sign of the light-hole and heavy-hole TMOKE resonances observed
in the limit of small magnetic ﬁelds (Fig. 4).
The susceptibilities at large ﬁelds can be simpliﬁed to a compact antisymmetric form

In particular, this model also predicts the saturation of the TMOKE in higher magnetic
ﬁelds.
Discussion
To conclude, we have demonstrated here the enhancement of TMOKE in the vicinity of a
narrow optical resonance. There are two distinct TMOKE regimes which depend on the
magnitude of the Zeeman splitting with respect to the linewidth. In the weak coupling
regime (∆< Γ) the TMOKE magnitude grows linearly with the increase of the Zeeman
splitting and its spectrum has an S-shape. On the contrary, in the strong coupling regime
14(∆> Γ) the TMOKE magnitude saturates, while its spectrum is strongly modiﬁed with
the increase of the Zeeman splitting leading to the appearance of two separate TMOKE
peaks. The spectral dependence of the TMOKE peaks and the sign of δ provide rich
information on the energy structure and selection rules for optical transitions.
Though in this work the considered phenomena were experimentally demonstrated at the
exciton resonances in a 10 nm-thick (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te QW, they can also be found
in other physical systems. For example, the optical resonances of the rare-earth ions in
dielectric materials are quite narrow so that Γ ≤∆even in moderate magnetic ﬁelds. In
this respect, X-ray spectra of the conﬁned quantum states are of interest [28–30]. For
instance, the rare-earth ions in orthoborates provide lines with ∆/Γ ≈1 in B ≈1 T [30].
Apart from X-ray, the visible and infrared spectra also demonstrate narrow lines [31–35].
Our results have several implications in fundamental and applied optics. First, resonant
TMOKE in the strong coupling regime can be used as a spectroscopic tool for investigation
of the energy structure of electronic states which are involved in optical transitions. It
should be noted that though TMOKE is usually considered as a surface sensitive eﬀect,
it is demonstrated here to be applicable for probing conﬁned resonances in the depth of
the sample as well.
Next, resonant TMOKE can be used to read out the in-plane magnetization of the sys-
tem which is appealing for possible applications in quantum information and sensing
technologies [36, 37]. Typically, the spin dynamics in semiconductors are assessed by
the polarization rotation due to the Faraday eﬀect or Polar Kerr eﬀect (PMOKE) [38].
However, these give access only to one of the spin components parallel to the direction
of light propagation (B ∥k). On the other hand, the TMOKE allows measuring the
perpendicular component of the magnetization. Thus, a combination of TMOKE and
PMOKE, provides the possibility for performing spin tomography.
15Methods
To investigate the TMOKE mediated by the excitons in a DMS, we used a quantum
well structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a 400 µm-thick (001) oriented GaAs
substrate. The 10 nm-thick magnetic Cd0.974Mn0.026Te quantum well layer is sandwiched
between non-magnetic Cd0.73Mg0.27Te barriers (3.25 µm thick buﬀer and 250 nm thick cap
layer, respectively).
The experimental studies were performed on the following two set-ups.
In the weak
coupling regime the sample was placed in a He ﬂow cryostat between the ferrite cores of
an electromagnet. Fourier imaging spectroscopy was used to measure the angular- and
wavelength- resolved reﬂectivity and TMOKE spectra at low temperatures of about 10 K
using a tungsten halogen lamp, which illuminates the sample with p-polarized light. The
reﬂected light was collimated using a microscope objective with numerical aperture of 0.4,
resulting in the experimentally accessible angular range of ±23◦. A telescope consisting of
two achromatic doublets mapped the collimated light onto the spectrometer slit. The exit
slit of the spectrometer was equipped with a thermoelectric cooled charge coupled device
(CCD) detector, providing a spectral resolution of 0.6 nm and an angular resolution of
about 0.4◦. By taking the reﬂected intensity for two opposite magnetic ﬁeld directions
the parameter δ characterizing the TMOKE was deduced. For these rather low magnetic
ﬁeld strengths, the noise level is reduced by repetitive switching of the magnetic ﬁeld
direction. This also smoothes potential ﬂuctuations of the lamps intensity.
On the other hand, in the giant Zeeman splitting case the sample was kept at a temper-
ature of 1.6 K inside a liquid helium bath cryostat equipped with a split-coil supercon-
ducting magnet. Transverse magnetic ﬁelds of up to 5 T were applied in order to observe
the magnetic ﬁeld induced change of reﬂectivity for p-polarized white light incident under
an angle of 5◦. The reﬂected light was subsequently dispersed by the spectrometer and
16detected with the CCD detector. Sweeping of the current in the superconducting magnet
is slow and therefore it does not allow to perform repetitive measurements in two oppo-
site magnetic ﬁelds within a reasonable time. Therefore we sweeped the magnetic ﬁeld
once in steps of 125 mT from −5 to 5 T and back again. For each magnetic ﬁeld step
we measured the reﬂected intensity multiple times in both p- and s-polarization. In this
case potential intensity ﬂuctuations of the white light source are smoothed by normaliz-
ing each p-polarized spectrum to the spectrally integrated s-polarized intensity for each
magnetic ﬁeld step Ip(B, ω)/Is(B). Using the spectrally integrated s-polarized intensity
for normalization has the advantage that otherwise small temperature deviations might
slightly shift the optical resonances and consequently change the spectral dependence of
TMOKE.

A: TMOKE near resonance at the surface of semi-inﬁnite material. Let us
analyze TMOKE at the interface [air]/[magnetic material] near a resonance (see Fig. 1b).
We consider a semi-inﬁnite magnetic material with dielectric tensor ϵ given by Eq. (2).
The analytical expression for TMOKE at the single interface of a semi-inﬁnite medium is
following [1]
δ = −2 Im
4ϵ tan θ
(ϵ −1)(ϵ −tan θ2)Q,
where θ is the incidence angle. Light comes from the air and reﬂects at the magnetic
dielectric. The magneto-optical response of the material is determined by Q = gy/ϵ. We
substitute the expressions for the dielectric tensor elements from Eq. (2) and take into
account that 4π|d|, tan θ and ϵb are real
δ = −16π|d|2 tan θ Im

where D = (E0 −E −iΓ)2 −∆2/4.
Next, we assume that the incident angle θ is small enough so that we can neglect tan θ2
with respect to ϵb. For instance, in semiconductors the diagonal elements of dielectric
tensor are about 10, therefore, this condition is satisﬁed up to incident angles of π/3;
in case of ferromagnetic dielectrics with ϵb ≈3 this assumption is valid for θ ≤π/4.
Therefore, the TMOKE has the following form
δ = −16π|d|2 tan θ Im

(S1)
One can see from Eq. (S1) that the TMOKE depends linearly on the incidence angle θ.
The dependence on Zeeman splitting ∆is more complicated, so we perform an asymptotic
1analysis. We address TMOKE at small and large values of ∆with respect to the resonance
half-linewidth Γ.
1. If ∆≪Γ than D = (E0 −E −iΓ)2 −∆2/4 ≈(E0 −E −iΓ)2. With this assumption
we rewrite Eq. (S1) as
δ = −16π|d|2 tan θ Im

∆
(ϵb −1)(E0 −E −iΓ) + 4π|d|2 ×
1
ϵb(E0 −E −iΓ) + 4π|d|2

.
One can see that 4π|d|2/ϵb should have the dimension of an energy, thus, we introduce
the energy related to the dipole moment Ed = 4π|d|2/ϵb, so
δ = −4Edϵb tan θ Im

We introduce the substitutions eE = (E0 −E) + Ed(1 +

therefore we come to the following expression
δ = −8Ed∆Γ tan θ
ϵb −1
eE
[( eE + a)2 + Γ2][( eE −a)2 + Γ2]
.
(S2)
The denominator is the product of two quadratic functions of eE that is symmetric with
respect to eE = 0. One can see that for ∆≪Γ the TMOKE depends linearly on the
Zeeman splitting ∆, and the sign of TMOKE changes around the excitonic resonance
energy.
2Besides that, when a ≪Γ, the denominator approaches to (Γ2 + eE2)2 with the deviation
of a2(2Γ2 −2 eE2 + a2). In this case the maximum deviation is estimated as 2a2/Γ2 and
Eq. (S2) is as follows
δ = −8Ed∆Γ tan θ

Thus, at eE = ±Γ/

2. If ∆≫Γ it should be taken into account that the resonances of TMOKE take place
when |E0−E| = ∆/2. Let us consider the case E0−E = ∆/2. In this case D ≈−iΓ∆−Γ2.
Taking α = Γ/∆as a small parameter (α →0, ∆→∞) we obtain from Eq. (S1)

It can be easily shown that in case of E0 −E = −∆/2 the TMOKE will have the opposite

B: TMOKE at the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton resonances.
Here, we
describe the derivation of Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) for the QW susceptibilities in Voigt geometry.
The scheme of the Zeeman splitting of the conduction and valence band states in the
Voigt geometry is shown in Fig. 3b. The Γ6 conduction band state splits into the states
ψe,↑(↓) =↑(↓)|s⟩with the energies
Ee,±1/2 = Ee ± 3A ,
(S7)
where A = 1
6αN0xSBS(ϵ), |s⟩is the s-symmetry Bloch amplitude and ↑(↓) are the spinors
with Se,y = ±1/2. The exchange interaction parameters are introduced in the main text
of Section . Ee is the energy of the electron ground state in the quantum well at zero
magnetic ﬁeld counted from the top of the bulk valence band.
The splitting of the Γ8 valence band states is described by the following Luttinger Hamil-

direction (d is the QW width). It phenomenologically describes the eﬀect of size quanti-
zation assuming inﬁnite QW walls. The eﬀect of strain is neglected and it is also assumed
that excitons have zero in-plane wave vector. The parameter B = 1/6N0xβSBS(ϵ) de-
scribes the exchange interaction with the Mn spins. We use the Luttinger parameters
γ1 ≈5.3ℏ2/2m0 and γ2 ≈1.6ℏ2/2m0 [40], where m0 is the free electron mass.
The Hamiltonian Eq. (S8) describes the competition between the Zeeman splitting in the
magnetic ﬁeld B ∥y and the size quantization along the z axis. Its eigenstates have the
following form:[39]
E(h)
hh,−= −k2
zγ1 −B −2

The spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. In the case of large magnetic ﬁeld the Zeeman splitting
overcomes the light-heavy-hole splitting so that the size quantization eﬀect can be ne-
glected and the states are characterized by the total momentum projection Jh,y onto the
ﬁeld direction, as indicated in Fig. 3. The hole eigenstates are given directly by Eq. (S9).
At zero magnetic ﬁeld the states with energies E(h)
hh,±, E(h)
lh,± are degenerate and correspond
to heavy and light-holes, respectively, with the splitting
∆lh = |E(h)
lh,±(B = 0) −E(h)
hh,±(B = 0)| = 4γ2(π/d)2.
(S11)
An increase of the magnetic ﬁeld leads to light-heavy-hole mixing. At weak magnetic ﬁeld
5the heavy-hole eigenstates can be written as

Here the main eﬀect is the admixture of the X-type state from the light-holes to the heavy-
holes which changes the symmetry of the heavy-hole states. This result is obtained by
diagonalizing Eq. (S8) and substituting the Bloch functions from Eq. (S9). The parameter
∆h,F = 6B
(S13)
is the giant Zeeman splitting of heavy-holes in Faraday geometry. The light-hole eigen-
states at weak magnetic ﬁeld read

Given the energy spectrum and the wave functions, we can calculate the eﬀective per-
mittivity tensor of the QW, neglecting the eﬀect of spatial dispersion. It is given by the

6where p is the momentum operator, m0 is the free electron mass, and we keep only the
resonant terms. In the cubic approximation the only nonzero matrix elements are
pcv = ⟨S|px|X⟩= ⟨S|py|Y ⟩= ⟨S|pz|Z⟩.
(S16)
It is convenient to introduce the LT splitting ωLT as 4πe2(m0/ωpcv)2 = ϵbωLT. Substi-
tuting Eqs. (S12),(S14) or Eqs. (S9) into Eq. (S15) we arrive to the permittivity tensors
Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) in the main text for weak and large magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. The
optically allowed excitonic transitions have the energies
Ehh,+ = Ee,+1/2 −E(h)
hh,+(B = 0),
Ehh,−= Ee,−1/2 −E(h)
hh,−(B = 0),
Elh,+ = Ee,+1/2 −E(h)
