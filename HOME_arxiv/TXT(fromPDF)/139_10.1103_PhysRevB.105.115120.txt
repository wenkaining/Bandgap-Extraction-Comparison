We have performed magneto-transport and high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on 
palladium (Pd) doped topological insulator PdxBi2Te3 (0   x  0.20) single crystals. We have observed unusually high values 
of magnetoresistance (~1500%) and mobility (~ 93000 cm2V-1s-1) at low temperatures for pristine Bi2Te3 that decrease on Pd doping. 
The Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations have been detected for x = 0.05, 0.10, confirming the presence of 2D topological surface 
states (TSSs) for these samples. The Hall measurement shows the crossover from n-type charge carriers in pristine Bi2Te3 to p-type 
charge carriers upon Pd doping. The ARPES measurements show that the conduction band crosses the Fermi level for pristine Bi2Te3, 
and the Dirac point of the TSSs and bulk-derived valence bands indicated shift to lower binding energy upon Pd doping in a rigid-band-
like way up to x ~ 0.10. Based on the comparison of the parameters obtained from the SdH and ARPES measurements, the reduction in 
the kF value in the magneto-transport measurements likely due to the band bending induced by the Schottky barrier. 
I.
INTRODUCTION:
Topological insulators (TIs) are one of the most exciting and 
studied systems in contemporary condensed matter physics. 
TIs are characterized by the gapless topological surface state 
(TSS) which are located inside the bulk band gap. The TSSs 
remain gapless under the perturbation conserving the 
topological number which is calculated based on the 
symmetry properties of the wave functions in the bulk.[1,2] 
The TSS has a helical spin texture, and its dispersion around 
the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) can be 
regarded as that of a massless Dirac fermion.[3] Electrons in 
the TSS acquires a π Berry phase after adiabatically 
completing a closed trajectory around the Fermi surface.[4] 
TIs exhibit a variety of exotic electronic transport properties 
such as non-saturating linear magnetoresistance, low field 
weak antilocalization effect (WAL), Shubnikov-de Haas 
(SdH) oscillations, and high carrier mobility.[5] Angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and 
scanning tunneling microscopy studies have directly 
revealed a Dirac-cone-like TSS in the bulk band gap.[6,7] 
The layered Bi2Te3 is one of the typical three-dimensional 
TIs and its TSSs has been extensively studied through 
transport and spectroscopy experiments.[6,8] Bi2Te3 
crystallizes in rhombohedral crystal structure with space 
group R3̅𝑚 (#166).[9] The unit cell of Bi2Te3 comprises of 
three quintuple layers (QLs) which are bonded by weak van 
der Waals forces, and each QL consists of five atomic layers 
arranged in TeI-Bi-TeII-Bi-TeI sequence. This weak binding 
force between Te atoms in adjacent QLs account for the easy 
cleavage along the ab-plane perpendicular to the c-axis, and 
the anisotropic thermal and electronic transport properties 
arise from these structural properties. The spectroscopy 
studies indicate that Bi2Te3 is an indirect narrow-band-gap 
(~150 meV) topological insulator with a single Dirac cone 
at the Γ̅ point.[6] Bi2Te3 has been known for the highest 
thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) around room 
temperature.[10] Superconductivity has also been observed 
in Bi2Te3 under high pressures between 3 - 6 GPa with a 
superconducting transition temperature of Tc ~ 3 K in the 
rhombohedral phase without structural phase transition.[11-
13] 
Previously, Hor et al.[14] has reported superconductivity at 
Tc ~ 5.5 K in PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0) 
compounds through ac susceptibility and resistivity 
measurements. Amit et al.[15] discussed the temperature 
dependent resistivity and magnetic susceptibility at various 
magnetic fields (H) and pressure (p) to construct the phase 
diagram for the superconducting compound PdBi2Te3. The 
superconducting transition temperature was decreased from 
Tc ~ 5.5 K with increasing pressure. Both the above reports 
indicated small superconducting volume fraction ~ 1% for 
the compound PdBi2Te3, which is likely due to the difficulty 
in Pd intercalation into the van der Waals gap between the 
QLs.[14] So far, however, the magneto-transport and high-
resolution ARPES measurements of Pd doped Bi2Te3 have 
not been explored yet. These measurements are quite useful 
in understanding the electron dynamics and electronic bandstructure and may give useful information about the 
topological surface states. Pd is a higher Z element in 
comparison to other dopants viz. Nb, Cu, and Sr, and known 
to show exchange enhanced magnetic susceptibility. It is, 
therefore, worth investigating the Pd doping from the 
viewpoint of tailoring the electronic transport, spin-orbit 
coupling, and topological surface states of the Bi2Te3. 
In this study, we present detailed electronic transport 
properties and high-resolution ARPES studies to investigate 
the palladium doped bismuth telluride, PdxBi2Te3 single 
crystals. We have observed a large value of the 
magnetoresistance, 
and ultra-high 
mobility at low 
temperatures in pristine Bi2Te3. The evolution of the 
electronic transport and topological surface state properties 
upon 
Pd 
doping 
is 
discussed 
in 
the 
light 
of 
magnetoresistance, quantum oscillations, WAL, and the 
electronic structure revealed by high-resolution ARPES. By 
combining the results from ARPES and SdH oscillations 
measurements, we discuss the macroscopic magneto-
transport properties from the viewpoint of microscopic 
electronic band structure.  
 
II.  EXPERIMENTS: 
Single crystals of PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) 
were grown using the flux method in two steps. High purity 
elemental Bi (99.99%), Te (99.999%), Pd (99.99%) from 
Sigma-Aldrich Co. were accurately weighed according to 
the stoichiometric ratios and vacuum sealed (>10-5 mbar) in 
quartz tubes. In the first step, Bi2Te3 were prepared for all 
the compositions. The compounds were heated at 850 °C for 
24 h, followed by cooling to 500 °C at the rate 10 °C /h, 
where they were kept for 72 h. Then, the compounds were 
furnace off cooled to room temperature. Second, for Pd 
doped samples, the melted Bi2Te3 and Pd were mixed 
thoroughly using mortar and pestle, pelletized and vacuum 
sealed and kept for another heat treatment at 850 °C for 48 
h, then slow cooled (3 °C/h) to 400 °C and kept for 12 h. 
Then, the compounds were furnace off cooled to room 
temperature. Single crystals were obtained from the ingots 
easily by cleaving perpendicular to the (00l) axis.  
The crystal structure and phase purity of the samples were 
determined by X-ray diffraction measurement at room 
temperature using Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with Cu-
K (= 1.5418 Å) radiation. The morphological studies on 
freshly exfoliated samples were studied using energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and field emission scanning 
electron microscope (FESEM FEI, Nova Nano SEM 450). 
Figures S1 and S2 depict the x-ray diffraction patterns, 
Rietveld refinements and layered morphology of studied 
samples.[16] The resistivity and Hall effect measurements 
were performed in a Physical Property Measurement 
System (PPMS, Quantum Design Inc.) using the standard 
four-probe contact configuration in the temperature range 
1.8 - 300 K up to magnetic fields of 8 T. Magnetization 
measurement were performed in a Magnetic Property 
Measurement System (MPMS, Quantum Design Inc.). The 
magnetic field was perpendicular to the cleaved plane of 
crystals and the current direction. The samples were 
exfoliated using scotch tape before performing above 
measurements.  
The high-resolution ARPES measurements were carried out 
using the -Laser ARPES system developed at the 
Hiroshima Synchrotron Radiation Center, Hiroshima 
University, Japan.[17] The samples were cleaved in situ on 
the 5 axes manipulator at a temperature of 20 K, using the 
top-post method. The base pressure was below 510-9 Pa. 
The Dirac-cone-like spectra was measured in the s-
polarization geometry along the Γ̅ −M̅ high symmetry line 
of the surface Brillouin zone. Azimuthal sample alignment 
was performed ex situ via measurements of Laue patterns, 
while the Γ̅-point position was determined by a fine angular 
map along the direction perpendicular to the dispersive 
direction of the analyzer slit. The position of the Fermi level 
was determined using the Fermi edge of the reference 
sample in electrical contact with the sample. The Laser spot 
size (on the sample) was less than 10 µm resulting in an 
intrinsic angular resolution of less than 0.05°. The overall 
instrumental energy resolution was estimated to be better 
than 2 meV.  
III. RESULTS: 
A. Transport measurements 
Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of 
longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) of PdxBi2Te3 crystals from 1.8 - 
300 K measured under zero field. The ρxx exhibits metallic 
behavior throughout the temperature range. The Residual 
Resistivity Ratio (RRR), which is defined as the ratio of 
resistivity at room temperature to that at low temperature 
(RRR = ρ(300 K)/ρ0(1.8 K)), decreased on Pd doping from 
~ 57 for Bi2Te3 to ~ 4 for Pd0.20Bi2Te3. The high value of 
RRR for Bi2Te3 is further reflected in the narrow linewidth 
in high-resolution ARPES spectra which is among the best 
for the 3D TIs[6,18-24] It has been reported that Bi2Te3 
show distinct resistivity behavior with varying value of RRR 
for different pieces of the crystal even if they are taken from 
the same batch grown in the same ampoule.[8] The 
electronic properties of these compounds strongly depend 
on the internal defects and inhomogeneity in the material. 
Theoretical studies by Black-Schaffer et al. on the role of 
subsurface impurities and vacancies in the 3D TIs suggestedthat bulk impurities can give rise to gapless bulk 
conductivity and may mask the surface transport 
properties.[25] Therefore, we measured ρxx(T) on the four 
different pieces of the crystal for each composition (See Fig. 
S3 [16]). Samples taken from some portions of the crystal 
were found to exhibit a broad hump shape around 100 - 150 
K, suggesting that the transport properties are sensitive to 
the inhomogeneity of the tellurium and anti-site defects 
present in the crystal. At low temperatures, all the ρxx(T) 
show saturation below 10 K, implying the finite residual 
resistivity. 
We 
have 
observed 
a 
signature 
of 
superconductivity in Pd0.20Bi2Te3 below Tc ~ 2.2 K in the 
magnetization measurements (See M(T) and M(H) curves in 
Fig. 
S4[16]). 
However, 
we 
could 
not 
detect 
superconductivity in the resistivity measurements, which is 
likely due to the low superconducting volume fraction. 
Figure 1(b) depicts the variation of charge carrier density (n) 
in the temperature range 1.8 - 300 K. The bulk carrier 
density was estimated using a single-carrier Drude band 
model, n(T) = 1/(eRH(T)). The slope has been calculated 
from the linear part of the magnetic field dependence of ρxy 
(See Fig. S5 [16]). It is evident that for all temperatures, ρxy 
is linear and negative for Bi2Te3, implying the presence of 
n-type bulk charge carriers. With an increase in Pd 
concentration ρxy changes its sign, manifesting the hole-
dominant transport in such systems. We find that the bulk 
carrier density is in the range 1018 - 1019 cm-3 for PdxBi2Te3 
without any appreciable temperature dependence except for 
Pd0.05Bi2Te3. It is to note that there is a sharp change in the 
carrier concentration of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 above T = 20 K. The 
transverse resistivity ρxy(H) of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 (See Fig. S5 
[16]) shows a sudden change in the slope between low 
temperature and high temperature ρxy(H) values.  
Using Hall coefficient (RH) and longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) 
data, we have estimated the Hall mobility (µ), which is 
shown in Fig. 1(c) with the smallest observed carrier density 
(7.581017 cm-3) and lowest residual resistivity (8.810-5 -
cm) at 1.8 K. These result in ultra-high mobility values of ~ 
93000 cm2V-1s-1 for pristine Bi2Te3. The extremely large 
mobility for Bi2Te3 is in accordance with the high RRR and 
large MR value (MR varies quadratically with mobility) as 
discussed below. 
 
 
 
Figure 1: (a) Temperature dependence of zero-field longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) for PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) of crystals, 
and (b), (c) show the variation of carrier density (n) and mobility () with temperature, respectively, calculated from Hall resistivity data. 
Figure 2(a) shows magnetoresistance (MR % = [ρxx(H) – 
ρxx(0)/ρxx(0)]  100%) for the PdxBi2Te3 crystals with 
magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface (ab - 
plane) as well as the current direction. The low temperature(T = 1.8 K) MR values for Bi2Te3 at 8 T field is ~1500 % 
which is larger than previously reported value of MR = 540 
% at 7 T by Shrestha et al.[26,27], MR  =  400 % at 13 T by 
Wang et al.[28], MR = 1000 % at 10 T by Singh et al.[29], 
and MR = 267 % at 9 T by Barua et al.[30] With the 
increasing Pd content, MR value decreases significantly 
from 1500 % (x = 0) to 300 % (x = 0.20). As seen from the 
Fig. 2(a), the MR of PdxBi2Te3 showed a quadratic 
dependence on magnetic fields. Figure 2(b) shows that the 
MR value remains almost unchanged up to 10 K, then starts 
to decrease on further increase of temperature. At 200 K, the 
MR curves of all Pd concentration overlaps and have similar 
values at room temperature. The decrease in MR value with 
temperature could also be associated with the increase in 
carrier concentration. The MR curves show parabolic field 
dependence at higher temperatures as well as with the 
increase in Pd content (See Fig. S6 [16]).  Generally, high 
MR values are

PdxBi2Te3 (x = 0 - 0.20).  
realized in semimetals, where electron and hole pockets 
coexist at the Fermi level.[31] A large value of MR and high 
mobility have been a feature of semimetals such as Bismuth, 
graphene, zero-gap semiconductors silver chalcogenides 
(Ag2+Se, Ag2+Te), Dirac and Weyl materials, and Heusler 
compounds.[31-36] The linear band dispersion as revealed 
by ARPES may results in high mobility, possibly due to high 
Fermi velocity of massless particles.[37] Moreover, a large 
non-saturating MR is expected in such systems.  
Interestingly, the MR measured on the crystal of 
Pd0.05Bi2Te3 with the broad hump shape anomaly around 
100-150K in ρxx(T) shows cusp-like feature at low magnetic 
field which is suggestive of WAL effect. To further examine 
the WAL effect, we show magnetoconductance of 
Pd0.05Bi2Te3 in Fig. 3. The WAL is a quantum correction to 
conductivity resulting from both the strong spin-orbit 
coupling in the bulk as well as the spin-momentum locking 
in the TSSs of TIs.[38] The cusp like positive MR in low 
fields due to the WAL are observed up to 20 K and reduces 
at high temperature. The WAL effect is derived from the 
destructive interference between two time-reversed electron 
paths around an impurity or scattering point. This 
destructive interference reduces the elastic backscattering, 
thereby increasing the conductivity. We have analyzed the 
WAL data using the well-known Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka 
(HLN) model[39]:

change in magnetoconductance (ΔGxx) at low temperatures and 
HLN fit (black line) in field range ±1 T. 
The prefactor  is expected to be -0.5 for the 2D topological 
surface states of TIs. We have shown the fitting (black line) 
of the magnetoconductance curve in the range 1 T in Fig. 
3. The obtained  values (~ -7) at T = 2.5 K is larger than 
the previously reported values in the range -0.4 to -2.5 for 
thin film as well as bulk samples of TIs.[40-44] Such largevalues can also be understood by assuming that some of the 
bulk channels also conduct together with the surface states 
of TIs. Additionally, the large value of magnetoconductance 
in this material is also consistent with the large value of . 
The 𝑙𝜙 values (~97 nm) are comparable to that discussed in 
the literature.[26] 
In the field dependent resistivity of Pd0.05Bi2Te3 and 
Pd0.10Bi2Te3, we have observed Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) 
oscillations. The quantum oscillation is an important probe 
to analyze the shape and sizes of the Fermi surface as well 
as topological properties of carriers. We have observed the 
oscillations at low temperatures (1.8 - 10 K) and magnetic 
field in the range of 4 to 8 T. The observed quantum 
oscillations in Δρxx for the x = 0.05 and x = 0.10 samples 
have been plotted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(c) as a function of 
inverse magnetic field at different temperatures (Δρxx has 
been determined by subtracting the polynomial background 
from ρxx). The magnitude of oscillations in Pd0.10Bi2Te3 is 
larger than that in Pd0.05Bi2Te3. The amplitude of SdH 
oscillations decreases with increase in temperature due to 
the thermal damping factor.  
In Figs. 4(b) and 4(d) the fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
amplitudes for the subtracted oscillations are plotted with 
the frequency. The FFT amplitudes of both samples 
decrease on increasing temperature. The x = 0.05 sample 
shows a prominent peak at the oscillation frequency of F = 
2.75 T for all temperatures whereas the x = 0.10 sample has 
a major peak at F = 4 T for 1.8 K which gradually shifts to 
7.2 T for higher temperatures. The frequencies of these 
oscillations are proportional to the extremal cross-section of 
Fermi surface (𝐴𝐹 = 𝐴(𝐸𝐹)) perpendicular to the applied 
magnetic field, based on the Onsager relation 𝐹= ℏ/
2𝜋𝑒 𝐴(𝐸𝐹). The calculated values of Fermi surface cross-
section assuming a circular Fermi surface (𝐴𝐹= 𝜋𝑘𝐹
2), Fermi 
wave vector (𝑘𝐹), Fermi velocity 𝑣𝐹= ℏ𝑘𝐹/𝑚𝑐, and the 
electron mean free path (𝑙𝐹= 𝑣𝐹𝜏) are presented in Table 1. 
The frequencies of 2.75 T and 4 T imply a cross section of 
2.681012 cm-2 and 3.831012 cm-2 respectively for x = 0.05 
and 0.10 samples. These values are almost two

respectively. 
orders less than what is measured from Hall resistivity: 
4.91018 cm-3 for x = 0.05 and 9.51017 cm-3 for x = 0.10. 
We assume, therefore, significant contributions from the 
bulk valence bands to the Hall resistivity measurements.The temperature and field dependent SdH oscillations 
amplitude in the resistivity (Δρxx) were analyzed to yield 
transport parameters. According to the Lifshitz - Kosevich 
(L-K) expression, oscillation amplitude in Δρxx is given by     
 
                                 Δρxx = ρT ρD 
where 𝜌𝑇= 
2𝜋2𝑘𝐵𝑇
ℏ𝜔𝑐sinh2𝜋2𝑘𝐵𝑇
ℏ𝜔𝑐
 ,      𝜌𝐷= 𝑒
− 2𝜋2𝑘𝐵𝑇𝐷
ℏ𝜔𝑐
 
Here, ρT is the thermal damping factor and ρD is the Dingle 
damping factor, 𝜔𝑐= 𝑒𝐻/𝑚𝑐 is the cyclotron frequency 
and TD is the Dingle temperature. In the Lifshitz-Kosevich 
theory, the thermal smearing of SdH oscillations is 
determined by the magnitude of cyclotron mass, 𝑚𝑐. As the 
temperature increases, the ratio of thermal energy to the 
cyclotron energy increases leading to the decrease in 
amplitude of oscillations. A fitting to the temperature 
dependent SdH oscillation amplitude shown in the inset of 
Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(c) at a fixed magnetic field H, yields the 
cyclotron mass 𝑚𝑐 of ~ 0.105𝑚𝑒 for both x = 0.05 and x = 
0.10. The effective mass obtained here are in fair agreement 
with that reported value ~ 0.09 𝑚𝑒 for the undoped 
Bi2Te3.[27,29,30,45] 
The Dingle temperature (TD) is calculated from the field 
dependence of the SdH oscillation amplitude at fixed 
temperature. It yields the same field dependence as does the 
impurity scattering.[46] The Dingle plot is shown in the 
insets of Figs. 4(a), and 4(c), in which ln(Δ𝜌𝑥𝑥𝐴sinh 𝛼𝑇/
𝐻)  against 1/H is plotted, where 𝛼= 2𝜋2𝑘𝐵𝑚𝑐/ℏ𝑒. A 
straight line fit to this plot generates a slope that contains 
Dingle temperature, given by −2𝜋2𝑘𝐵𝑚𝑐𝑇𝐷/ℏ. From TD, 
quantum scattering lifetime   for the carriers is calculated 
based on the relation 
ℏ
𝜏= 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇𝐷. Then, we can further 
calculate surface carrier mobility (𝜇𝑠= 𝑒𝜏/𝑚𝑐= 𝑒𝑙𝑆𝑑𝐻/
ℏ𝑘𝐹) and mean free path (𝑙𝑆𝑑𝐻) of surface carrier. The 
obtained lower Dingle temperature value implies weaker 
impurity scattering that results in higher quantum 
mobility.[46] The calculated surface carrier mobility is less 
than that calculated from Hall measurement. 
To further study the topological properties of the surface 
states, we estimated the Berry phase value from the Landau 
level fan diagram, that is given by n = F/2πH+, where n is 
the nth Landau level, F is the SdH oscillation period, H is the 
magnetic field. The inset of Fig. 4(b, d) shows the Landau 
level fan diagram plotted as the 1/H positions of maxima and 
minima in the background subtracted SdH oscillations in 
resistivity as a function of the integer values known as 
Landau indices. The minima in resistivity correspond to 
integer values n and maxima to n+1/2. The zeroth Landau 
level can be extracted from the linear extrapolation of the 
1/H = 0, which gives n0 = 0.33 and 0.35 for x = 0.05 and 
0.10, respectively. The Berry phase 𝜑= 2𝜋𝛽 is 0,  = 0, for 
the normal fermions, and Berry phase is 𝜋,  = 0.5 for the 
Dirac fermions with the linear dispersion relation. The 
extracted values of n0 in our results are closer to 0.5, 
indicating that the oscillations arise from the topological 
surface states with a finite contribution from bulk states. 
Thus, the analysis of SdH oscillations provide evidence of 
non-zero Berry phase for x = 0.05 and 0.10 samples, which 
indicates the existence of the TSSs.

B. High-resolution ARPES measurements 
 
Figures 5(b)-5(f) represent the high-resolution ARPES 
image plots on PdxBi2Te3 (0  x  0.20) taken along the Γ̅ −
M̅  high symmetry direction (Fig. 5(a)). The energy 
distribution curves (EDCs) taken at the Γ̅ point are shown in 
Figs. 5(g)-5(k). The EDC peaks at the Dirac point can be 
fitted by a single Lorentzian function suggesting the gapless 
TSS for PdxBi2Te3 (0   x  0.20) samples in agreement with 
non-zero Berry phase. One can see the Dirac cone like TSSs 
crossing the Fermi level as well as signals from the bulk 
valence bands projections. In the case of pristine Bi2Te3, 
there exist electron like conduction bands inside the TSSs 
for the upper part of the Dirac cone.[6,7] In this study, 
pristine Bi2Te3 is apparently n-type because the Fermi level 
intersects with the bulk conduction band (Fig. S7 [16]), the 
electron-like conduction band is compatible with the 
negative Hall coefficient in the bulk. 
 
It is clearly seen from Figs. 5 (b)-5(f) that the initial addition 
of Pd into the crystal leads to hole doping of the entire 
electronic structure and both the TSSs and bulk derived 
valence states are shifted toward higher energy in a rigid-
band-like manner. The energy shift continues up to x = 0.1 
and stopped for x  0.10. Note that bulk valence bands cross 
the Fermi level for the x  0.1 samples, in agreement with 
the positive Hall coefficient in the bulk. It should be noted 
that the topological surface state of x = 0.05 is well-isolated 
from the bulk band at EF, and the electric transport is 
governed by the surface state. On the other hand, for higher 
compositions, the bulk valence bands go across EF, 
indicating that the contribution of the surface states might 
be masked by the bulk carriers in the transport properties. 
Note that other doped topological insulator AxBi2Se3 (Sr, 
Nb, Cu) are reported to show downward shift of Dirac point 
with increase in dopant concentration.[47-50] The position 
and time dependent ARPES results on x = 0.10 and x = 0.20 
are presented in supplemental information (See Fig. S8 and 
S9 [16]). We found the difference of the energy is at most 
~8 meV. In the case of the pristine sample (Bi2Te3), the 
energy deviation was below the detection limit. These 
results indicate the magnitude of the homogeneity. After 24 
hours of cleavage, the DP was shifted to lower energy likely 
due to the adsorption of residual gas on the sample surface.  
In Figs. 6(a)-(c), on moving towards the lower binding 
energy (i.e., from the EF to the Dirac point), the shape of 
constant energy contour for Bi2Te3 changes from a star-like 
to a circle with decreasing the cross-section area, whereas 
for Pd doped samples, it is already rounded hexagon at EF.Figure 6(d) shows the surface charge carrier density as a 
function of the Pd concentration. The initial Pd doping leads 
to a rapid reduction of carrier density of the TSS up to a 
value of x = 0.1, after that the TSS density remains 
essentially unchanged. The saturation of the doping level of 
the TSSs above x = 0.1 where the valence band maximum 
(VBM) starts to cross the Fermi level. One can expect a 
significant contribution from the bulk valence band for x  
0.1 sample.  
In order to evaluate the 𝑘𝐹 value, we fit the momentum 
distribution curve (MDC) at the Fermi level using Voigt 
function (See Fig. S10 [16]).[51] As a result, we can 
estimate the charge carrier density 𝑛2𝐷,𝑇𝑆𝑆=

TSSs. The Fermi velocity (𝑣𝐹) and effective mass (𝑚∗) were 
determined by using the formula 𝑣𝐹=

Г  using the 
MDC width δk, which is a Lorentzian linewidth in the Voigt 
function (Gaussian line width represents the instrumental 
resolution).[51-53] It should be noted that ARPES linewidth 
at EF is sensitive to the lattice defects, and the observed 
linewidth for all our compositions are among the narrowest 
for the reported doped topological insulators.[6,18-24]

IV. DISCUSSION: 
Now, we compare results obtained from the SdH oscillation 
and ARPES measurements. The Fermi wavenumber 
obtained from the SdH oscillation are almost identical for x 
= 0.05 and 0.10 samples, 𝑘𝐹~ 1 106 cm-1, and the values 
are smaller by a factor of 1/7 (x = 0.05) and 1/4 (x = 0.10) in 
comparison to that obtained from ARPES results. The 
reduction in the 𝑘𝐹 value obtained from magneto-transport 
is likely due to the band bending induced by the Schottky 
barrier leading to the shifting of the Fermi level towards the 
Dirac point. We assume the band bending is saturated if the 
valence band crosses the Fermi level as shown in Fig. 5. 
Based on the observed Fermi surfaces by ARPES, one can 
clearly see that the Fermi surface area for the Pd doped 
samples are reasonably approximated by 𝐴𝐹 = 𝜋𝑘𝐹
2. Since 
the area and surface carrier density is in proportion to kF2, 
the ARPES results yield 16 (= 42) to 49 (= 72) times larger 
values compared with the magneto-transport measurements. 
On the other hand, the cyclotron mass, mc ~ 0.1me for x = 
0.05 and 0.10 samples, obtained from the SdH oscillation 
are close to the effective mass m* ~ 0.2me evaluated in the 
ARPES experiments. We assume that the effective mass 
given by SdH and ARPES are similar in spite of the 
difference in the kF value because of the linearity of the band 
dispersion of the TSSs. Furthermore, we should note that the 
mean-free-path, l = 𝑣𝐹τ = 13-15 nm, obtained from SdH 
oscillation are close to the values, l = 1/δk = 𝑣𝐹τ = 17 - 50 
nm, evaluated from ARPES. As the Berry phase is closer to 
π, we assume that the parameters obtained by the SdH 
oscillation mainly derive from the TSSs, while the carrier 
density is likely reduced due to the band bending.  
 
It is important to note the difference in these two 
measurements. While the TSSs on the surface is directly 
(d)observed by ARPES, the metal-semiconductor contacts are 
inevitable for the transport measurements. The Schottky 
barrier induces the band bending at the interface, which 
modifies the energy position of the Dirac point location in 
the near surface region.[18,54] Therefore, the Fermi wave 
number may be modified in the SdH oscillation 
measurements, and hence the surface carrier density. 
Furthermore, the SdH oscillation provide parameters 
averaged over the Fermi surface while ARPES results are 
along the Γ̅ −M̅ high symmetry direction. We should note, 
however, the anisotropy of the Fermi surface shape is 
reduced for doped samples (x > 0.05). Furthermore, the 
ARPES signals are obtained from the beam spot size of < 
10m ϕ, while SdH oscillation signals are averaged over ~1 
mm2 size samples. 
 
V. CONCLUSION: 
We have presented the effect of Pd doping on the magneto-
transport and electronic properties of Bi2Te3 crystals. We 
have shown the evolution of various electronic parameters 
such as lifetime and mean-free-path of carriers at the Fermi 
level obtained through the ARPES and SdH oscillations 
studies. The observation of SdH oscillations, weak 
antilocalization, non-zero Berry phase in magneto-transport 
studies clearly indicated the contribution from the 
topologically nontrivial surface states. The Dirac cone-like 
surface states in ARPES confirms that PdxBi2Te3 retains its 
topological properties upon Pd doping. Hall measurement 
shows the crossover from n-type charge carriers in undoped 
Bi2Te3 to p-type charge carriers upon Pd doping in the bulk. 
This is consistent with the ARPES results, in which both 
Dirac cone and bulk derived valence states are pushed 
towards the Fermi level upon Pd addition. Besides the 
energy shift of the Dirac point, the quasiparticle properties 
such as effective mass and mean-free-path are consistent 
with the SdH oscillation and ARPES measurements, which 
are consistent with the linearity of the band dispersion of the 
TSS.

Figure S1 (I) depicts the X-ray diffraction pattern on the crystals showing peaks corresponding to the (00l) planes, 
suggesting the crystals are grown along the ab plane. Figure S1 (II) shows the picture of crystals cleaved from the bulk 
ingot and rhombohedral crystal structure of PdxBi2Te3 drawn using VESTA software. The crystal structure shows the 
intercalated position of palladium atoms in the van der Waals gap between the quintuple layers (QLs). Figure S1 (III) shows 
the Laue diffraction pattern on the crystals.  
 
Figure S2 (I) shows the Rietveld refined patterns of the powdered samples using the FullProf Suite, fitted with the 
rhombohedral structure (R3̅m) of Bi2Te3. A comparison of the lattice parameters for all the compositions is tabulated in 
Table S1. The atomic radius of Pd (1.40 Å) is comparable to atomic radius of Bi (1.60 Å) than the Te (1.15Å). This may 
lead to the formation of secondary phase with increase in Pd content in Bi2Te3. The lattice parameters obtained in this study 
are indicative that the lattice expands with the Pd concentration. However, we find an impurity peak at 2θ = 30.8o which 
corresponds to Pd9Te4.  
 
Figure S2 (II, III) shows the FE-SEM images taken on crystals showing the layered morphology on different scales (5 and 
10 µm).  
 
Figure S3 shows the temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity in zero-field for flakes (three for each composition) 
in addition to that presented in main manuscript.  
 
Figure S4 presents the magnetization measurements results on Pd0.20Bi2Te3 which reveal finite superconductivity (a) 
temperature dependence of magnetization, M(T) with superconducting transition (Tc) at 2.2 K, (b) magnetic field 
dependence of magnetization, M(H) plot at 1.8 K, showing superconducting hysteresis loop.    
 
Figure S5 shows the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity at different temperatures (1.8 - 300 K) for the samples 
presented in main manuscript. 
 
Figure S6 shows the magnetic field dependence of magnetoresistance (MR%) at different temperatures (1.8 – 300 K) for 
the samples presented in main manuscript. 
 
Figure S7 shows Fermi surface of Bi2Se3 measured by ARPES. While the spectral intensity is weak, one can see spectral 
intensity of the bulk conduction band around the Γ̅ point. 
 
Figure S8(a) shows ARPES spectra of x = 0.10 from arbitrarily selected three different points just after cleaving (fresh 
surface), and Fig. S8(b) shows corresponding ARPES spectra after 24 hours of cleavage (aged surface). By the fitting ofEDC spectra at the 𝛤̅  point, the Dirac point energies were evaluated to be -0.082 ~ -0.088 eV, which were consistent with 
our previous measurements -0.081 ~ -0.087 eV. The Dirac point energy may vary by ~10% depending on measurement 
points on the surface, which falls within the error bars. Note that the Dirac point energy was shifted to lower energy (electron 
doping) by 0.035-0.042 eV after 24 hours, which was likely due to the adsorption of the residual gas on the sample surface. 
 
Figure S9(a) shows ARPES spectra of x = 0.20 from arbitrarily selected two different points just after cleaving, and Fig. 
S9(b) shows corresponding ARPES spectra after 24 hours of cleavage. We found that the Dirac point was -0.070 ~ -0.072 
eV for fresh surface. After 24 hours, the Dirac point was shifted to lower energy by 0.078 - 0.102 eV due to the deterioration 
of the surface. The energy shifts for x = 0.20 were larger than those for x = 0.10 and hence more sensitive to the surface 
deterioration. 
 
Figure S10 shows fitting results of EDCs at the Γ̅ point. We could reproduce the EDC using single Lorentzian function, 
which indicates no gap opening at the Dirac point.
