A novel type of one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystal formed by the array of periodically located
stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background dielectric medium is
proposed. The wave equation for the electromagnetic wave propagating in such a structure is solved
in the framework of the Kronig-Penney model. The frequency band structure of 1D graphene-based
photonic crystal is obtained analytically as a function of the ﬁlling factor and the thickness of the
dielectric between graphene stripes. The photonic frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic
wave localized by the defect of photonic crystal formed by the extra dielectric placed on the place
of the stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes is obtained.

INTRODUCTION
Photonic crystals are formed by structures with the dielectric constant periodically varying in space [1]. Electro-
magnetic waves in photonic crystals have a band spectrum and a coordinate dependence caused by this periodicity
of the dielectric constant. Interestingly enough that the solution of Maxwell’s equations with a periodic dielectric
constant, resulting in photonic band-gap structures, is similar to the solution to Schr¨odinger’s equation for a periodic
potential, resulting in the electron energy band-gap structures in solids. Electromagnetic waves penetrate in the pho-
tonic crystal similar to the Bloch waves of electrons in a regular crystal. The width of the photonic band gap depends
on the geometrical parameters of the photonic crystal and the contrast of the dielectric constants of the constituent
elements [2, 3]. Diﬀerent materials have been used for the corresponding constituent elements including dielectrics,
semiconductors and metals [2, 3, 6–9]. The photonic crystals with superconducting elements have been studied in
Refs. [10–16].The one-dimensional photonic crystals formed by semiconductors were analyzed in Ref. [17]. It is well
known that the properties of photonic crystals provide an opportunity to manipulate the emission, propagation and
distribution of light [4, 5] and photonic crystals can be used as frequency ﬁlters. The properties of photonic crystals
were reviewed in Ref. [18].
Photonic crystals are diﬀerent from the regular solid crystals in the following way. While Schr¨odinger’s equation
describes the regular solid crystals via the scalar wave function, Maxwell’s equations for photonic band-gap crystals
describes the electric or magnetic ﬁeld, which is a vector corresponding to the transverse electromagnetic waves.
A novel type of 2D electron system was experimentally obtained in graphene, which is a 2D honeycomb lattice of
the carbon atoms that form the basic planar structure in graphite [19, 20]. Due to unusual properties of the band
structure, electronic properties of graphene became the object of many recent experimental and theoretical studies
[19–25]. Graphene is a gapless semiconductor with massless electrons and holes which have been described as Dirac-
fermions [26]. The unique electronic properties of graphene in a magnetic ﬁeld have been studied recently [27–30].
The space-time dispersion of graphene conductivity was analyzed in Ref. [31]. A graphene-based two-dimensional
photonic crystal was proposed in Ref.
[32], where its frequency band structure was studied. Diﬀerent types of 2D
photonic crystals were reviewed in Ref. [33].
In this Paper, we consider a one-dimensional photonic crystal formed by an array of periodically located parallel
stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedding into a background dielectric medium. The graphene
stripes are placed one under the other with the dielectric stripes placed between them. We calculate the frequency
band structure of such a photonic crystal. The photonic band structure usually can be obtained using numerical
calculations. In this Paper we obtain the analytical solution for the wave equation with the periodical dielectric
function. We also calculate the frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized due to a defect in the
array of the stacks of graphene stripes separated by a dielectric stripes.
The Paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II we obtain the photonic band structure of the 1D graphene-
based photonic crystal. In Sec. III we ﬁnd the frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized by the
defect of a 1D graphene-based photonic crystal. Finally, the discussion of the results and conclusions follow in Sec. IV.2

THE WAVE EQUATION FOR 1D PHOTONIC CRYSTAL WITH GRAPHENE STRIPES
We consider polarized electromagnetic waves with the electric ﬁeld E perpendicular to the plane of graphene stripes.
The wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in a dielectric media has the form [34]
∆E(r, t) −ε(r, t)
c2
∂2E(r, t)
∂t2
= 0 ,
(1)
where ε(r, t) is the dielectric constant of the media, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. Looking for solutions with
harmonic time variation of the electric ﬁeld, i.e., E(r, t) = E(r)eiωt, and considering the propagation of wave in the
x−direction along the plane of graphene stripes and perpendicular to the graphene-dielectric boundaries one obtains
from Eq. (1)
∂2Ez(x)
∂x2
+ ω2ε(x, ω)

Ez(x) = 0 .

The dielectric constant of the 1D periodic structure is given by

2(a −b) + na ,
ε1(ω),

2(a + b) + na,
where ε0 is the dielectric constant of the dielectric, ε1(ω) is the dielectric function of graphene multilayers separated
by the dielectric barriers, a is the period of 1D array of graphene stripes, b is the width of graphene stripes, and n is
an integer. The 1D photonic crystal with graphene stripes separated by dielectric layers with a thickness d is shown
in Fig. 1. By introducing the ﬁlling factor f the relation between a and b can be written as b = af.
The dielectric function ε1(ω) of a graphene multilayers system separated by dielectric layers with a dielectric
constant ε0 and a thickness d is given by [35, 36]
ε1(ω) = ε0 + 4πiσg(ω)

Here e is the charge of an electron, τ −1 is the electron collision rate, η is the Heaviside step function, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, and µ is the the chemical potential determined by the electron concentration, which is controlled
by the doping. The chemical potential can be calculated as µ = (πn0)1/2¯hvF , where the electron concentration is
given by n0 = (µ/(¯hvF ))2/π and vF = 108 cm/s is the Fermi velocity of electrons in graphene [36].
We solve the wave equation (2) to ﬁnd the eigenfrequencies corresponding to the electromagnetic wave penetrating
in the photonic crystal shown in Fig. 1. This wave equation is mathematically similar to the Schr¨odinger equation for
an electron moving in a one-dimensional rectangular periodic potential barrier described by the Kronig-Penney model.
The eigenenergies of the Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to the Kronig-Penney model presented in Eq. (A1) are
given by [37]:
cos(ka) = cosh(βb) cos [αa(1 −f)] + α2 −β2

The eigenfrequencies of the 1D photonic crystal as functions of the wave vector k can be obtained by substituting the
dielectric constant of the multilayer graphene given by Eq. (3) into Eq. (7). The solutions of Eq. (7) for ω as functions
of k provides the frequency band structure for 1D photonic crystal formed by the periodically located parallel stacks of
alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background dielectric medium and allow one to determine
the photonic band gap Ω. Eq. (7) shows that the photonic band gap depends on the ﬁlling factor f and the period
of 1D array of graphene stripes a, as well as on the thickness d of the dielectric stripes that separate the graphene
stripes. Let us mention that dependence of the photonic band gap on the thickness d of the dielectric layer, which
separates the graphene stripes, is presented in (7), since the dielectric function ε1(ω) (3) of a graphene multilayers
system separated by dielectric layers depends on d.
III.
LOCALIZATION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE ON THE DEFECT
Let us consider a defect in the array of stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a
background dielectric medium. This defect is formed by one empty space or “1D vacancy” due to the absence of a
stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes in one place, where it should be placed due to the periodicity.
This place is ﬁlled by the dielectric. This extra dielectric stipe contributes to the dielectric contrast that results by
adding the term −ω2/c2(ε1(ω) −ε0)γ(|x −x0|)Ez(x) to the r.h.s. in Eq. (2). Here γ(|x −x0|) = 1 for |x −x0| ≤b,
and γ(|x −x0|) = 0 for |x −x0| > b, where x0 corresponds to the coordinate in the middle of 1D defect, which is the
coordinate of the middle of the absent graphene stripe. As a result we obtain the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld
for 1D photonic crystal with the defect:
∂2Ez(x)
∂x2
+ ω2
c2 (ε(x, ω) −(ε1(ω) −ε0)γ(|x −x0|)) Ez(x) = 0 .
(8)
Eq. (8) describes the periodic array of stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes with the defect formed by
one stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes being absent.
We solve the wave equation (8) to ﬁnd the eigenfrequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized at
the defect formed by a background dielectric medium due to the absence of the stack of alternating graphene and
dielectric stripes in one place, where it should be placed due to the periodicity. This wave equation is similar to the
Schr¨odinger equation describing the electron in the periodic potential energy in the presence of the potential energy
of the defect placed at the point x0 given in Appendix B. From the mapping of Klein-Gordon type equation given by
Eq. (B6) the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in graphene-based photonic crystal has the following form

d2Ez(x)
dx2
−2ω2Ω2(ε1(ω) −ε0)γ(|x −x0|)Ez(x) = (ω4 −Ω4)Ez(x) ,
(9)4
where k0 = 2π/a is the vector of the 1D reciprocal lattice. This Klein-Gordon type equation has the eigenvalue
ω4 −Ω4. In Eq. (9) Ωis the width of the forbidden band (photonic gap) in the spectrum of the electromagnetic wave.
The electric ﬁeld can be obtained by mapping Eqs. (B7) and (B9) that correspond to wavefunctions of the stationary
states. The continuity of the electric ﬁeld and its derivative in the points x = x0 + b/2 and x = x0 −b/2 result in the
transcendental equation determining the spectrum of the even states:
p
ω2Ω2(ε1(ω) −ε0)2 −ω4 + Ω4 tan

as well as of the odd states:

p
ω2Ω2(ε1(ω) −ε0)2 −ω4 + Ω4b2/c2
= −

|ω4 −Ω4| .
(11)
Solving Eqs. (10) and (11) with respect to the frequency ω, we obtain the frequency corresponding to the photonic
mode localized by the defect.

DISCUSSION
In the calculations below we assume n0 = 1011 cm−2. For simplicity, we consider the same material for a background
dielectric medium and dielectric stripes between the graphene stripes. As the dielectric material we consider SiO2
with the dielectric constant ε0 = 4.5. Using Eq. (7) we calculated the band structure for 1D graphene-based photonic
crystal. The results of the calculations of the dispersion relation of the photonic crystal are presented in Fig. 2.
The photonic band structure is calculated for diﬀerent distances between graphene layers d. In our calculations we
used the chemical potential for the electrons in graphene µ = 3.525 × 10−21J, temperature T = 300 K, the period
of the 1D graphene stripes array a = 25 × 10−6 m, and the ﬁlling factor f = 0.3927. According to the results of
our calculations, the photonic band structure almost does not depend on ε0 due to the fact that ε0 ≪|ε1|. The
results of our calculations demonstrate the strong dependence of the photonic band structure on the thickness d of
the dielectric that separates the graphene stripes. At d = 1 nm and d = 5 nm the distance between the lower and the
upper dispersion curves is larger in the middle than at the edges. At d = 3 nm and d = 10 nm the distance between
the lower and the upper dispersion curves is larger at the edges than in the middle.
Using Eqs. (10) and (11) we calculate frequencies corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized by the defect
in the photonic crystal formed due to the absence of a stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes in one
place, where it should be placed due to the periodicity. For the photonic crystal with the defect at d = 1 nm we
have ν = 1.79 THz, at d = 3 nm we have ν = 1.85 THz, at d = 5 nm we have ν = 3.91 THz, at d = 10 nm we
have ν = 3.62 THz. All these frequencies are located inside the photonic band gap. Let us mention that since our
approach is based on the Luttinger-Kohn model [39, 40], the localized frequency ν does not depend on momentum.
The frequency localized by the defect is just a constant in the photonic band structure, which can be controlled by
the thickness d of the dielectric stripes that separate the graphene stripes, as well as by the ﬁlling factor f and the
period of 1D array of graphene stripes a.
In conclusion, the graphene-based photonic crystal proposed in this paper is a novel type one-dimensional photonic
crystal formed by the array of the stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background
dielectric medium. This system can be analyzed as a 1D photonic crystal and the corresponding wave equation for the
electromagnetic wave propagating in such a structure can be solved in the framework of the Kronig-Penney model.
The frequency band structure is obtained analytically as a function of the ﬁlling factor, the period of 1D array of
graphene stripes and the thickness of the dielectric between the graphene stripes. We obtain the photonic frequency
corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized at the defect of a photonic crystal formed by a background
dielectric medium due to the absence of the stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes in one place, where it
should be placed due to the periodicity.

scatterers with the rectangular potential, b is the width of the rectangular potential barrier, and n is an integer.
It is easy to see that the wave equation (2) with the dielectric constant given by Eq. (3) can be mapped onto the
Schr¨odinger equation (A1) for an electron in the 1D periodic potential corresponding to the Kronig-Penney model.

Appendix B: The Dirac-type equations for the the electromagnetic wave in the photonic crystal with the
defect
Following Ref. [15] we can map the wave equation for the photonic crystal with the defect onto the Schr¨odinger
equation in the periodic ﬁeld with the defect. After mapping of Eq. (8) onto the Schr¨odinger equation describing the
electron with the eﬀective electron mass m0 in the periodic potential energy V (x) in the presence of the potential
energy of the defect Wγ(|x −x0|) placed at the point x0 we have

In Eq.(B1) ψ(x) = Ez(x),

and the potential V (x) is given in Eq. (A1) and potential W is deﬁned as
W = ¯h2ω2
2m0c2 (ε1(ω) −ε0) .
(B2)
Eq. (B1) has the same form as Eq. (6) in Ref. [38]. However, in our case the potential W is deﬁned by Eq. (B2)
and corresponds to the potential of the defect in the Schr¨odinger equation for an “electron” in the periodic ﬁeld of
the crystal lattice and in the presence of the defect.
We will reduce the problem of the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle in the periodic potential V (x) related to the
system of the periodically placed stacks of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes embedded into a background
dielectric medium and an “defect potential” W related to a defect to a much simpler equation for the envelope
wavefunctions. Taking into account the two-band structure and following the two-band model [38] we introduce a
two-component spinor wave function ψ(x)
ψ(x) =

ϕ(x)
χ(x)

,
(B3)
where two diﬀerent neighboring bands are described by wave functions ϕ(x) and χ(x). Note that Eq. (B1) contains
both the periodic function V (x) corresponding to the ideal lattice and W, describing the potential of a defect. Without
a defect the energy spectrum would be described by two neighboring bands and the gap between them. Applying the
standard two-band approach, we obtain an eﬀective Dirac-type equation for the envelope spinor wave function, which
implies the periodicity provided by V (x) [15, 38].
Note that Eq. (B1) describes an electron in the periodic potential of the ideal crystal lattice V (x) and the potential
of the defect W. If the solution corresponding to the absence of impurity W = 0 is known, the energy levels of
the electron localized by the defect can be obtained by replacing Eq. (B1) by the Dirac-type equation according to
Luttinger-Kohn model described in Refs. [38–40]. This model implies a Dirac-type equation for the two-component
spinor wave function. According to Ref. [38], the functions ϕn(x) and χn(x) deﬁned as
ϕn(x) =

cn(k) exp [ikx/¯h] ,
χn(x) =

(B4)
satisfy the set of the second order partial diﬀerential equations. Considering only two neighboring bands corresponding
to the wave function ψ(x) given by Eq. (B3) this set of equations for ϕn(x) and χn(x) can be reduced to the Dirac-type
equations for the two-component spinor (B3), which has the following form [38]
[εω −∆ω −Wγ(|x −x0|)] ϕ(x) + i¯hsσx

where s = ¯hk0/(

3m0). In Eq. (B5) σx is Pauli matrix and ∆ω is the width of the forbidden band in the electron
spectrum that, as it follows from the mapping of the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld graphene-based photonic
crystal onto Eq. (B1), is ∆ω =
¯h2Ω2
2m0c2 , where Ωis the width of the forbidden band (photonic gap) in the spectrum
of the electromagnetic wave. Eqs. (B5) are obtained in the limit |ε2

Deﬁning the eﬀective
mass of a quasiparticle as mω = 3m2
0∆ω/(¯h2k2
0) , and following the standard procedure of quantum electrodynamics
[41, 42] we obtain from the system of Dirac-type Eqs. (B5) the following Klein-Gordon type equation. Note that
the Klein Gordon equation can be reduced to a Schr¨odinger-like equation with an eﬀective energy and an eﬀective
potential. If the potential is weak enough to ignore the W 2 term, the relativistic formalism becomes equivalent to the
non-relativistic formalism. More importantly, in situations where the Klein-Gordon equation is not exactly solvable,
the Schr¨odinger form of the Klein-Gordon equation sheds some light on the problem as it could be reduced to a
