1Abstract
Martensitic transformations are strain driven displacive transitions governing the mechanical and
physical properties in intermetallic materials. This is the case in Ni2MnGa, where the martensite
transition is at the heart of the striking magnetic shape memory and magneto-caloric properties.
Interestingly, the martensitic transformation is preceded by a pre-martensite phase, and the role
of this precursor and its inﬂuence on the martensitic transition and properties is still a matter of
debate. In this work, we report on the inﬂuence of Co doping (Ni50−xCoxMn25Ga25 with x = 3
and 5) on the martensitic transformation path in stoichiometric Ni2MnGa by neutron diﬀraction.
The use of the superspace formalism to describe the crystal structure of the modulated martensitic
phases, joined with a group theoretical analysis allows unfolding the diﬀerent distortions featuring
the structural transitions. Finally, a general Landau thermodynamic potential of the martensitic
transformation, based on the symmetry analysis is outlined. The combined use of phenomenological
and crystallographic studies highlights the close relationship between the lattice distortions at the
core of the Ni2MnGa physical properties and, more in general, on the properties of the martensitic
transformations in the Ni-Mn based Heusler systems.

INTRODUCTION
Martensitic transformations, diﬀusion-less, displacive and ﬁrst order transitions from a
high symmetry austenite phase to a low symmetry martensite phase,[1] are strain-driven
phase transitions observed in diﬀerent classes of materials.[1, 2] The transformation is
characterized by the appearance of strong lattice strains frequently joined with shuﬄes
and/or shears of speciﬁc lattice planes resulting in macroscopic changes of the crystal
shape and of the material microstructure.[1] Diverse and striking physical phenomena occur
at the martensitic transformation ranging from enhancement of the material’s mechanical
strength,[1, 2] shape memory eﬀects,[3] magneto- and mechano-caloric eﬀects[4, 5] and even
exotic new topological states.[6] The knowledge of martensite symmetry and how the distor-

properties characterizing such materials.[7, 8]
Heusler alloys are a wide class of materials showing martensitic transformations induced
by diﬀerent external stimuli such as temperature-changes,[9–13] magnetic-ﬁeld [14, 15] as
well as applied strain and pressure.[13, 16–18] Moreover, the Heusler structure is able to host
a large variety of chemical species by adjusting the lattice symmetry and distortions,[13, 19–
24] resembling the structural ﬂexibility observed in perovskite oxides. The ideal cubic struc-
ture of austenite can undergo symmetry-breaking transitions showing close analogies to per-
ovskite distortions.[19] Let us consider a martensitic transformation that takes place from
a high-temperature cubic L21 austenite phase (space group Fm3m1′) to a low-temperature
tetragonal non-modulated L10 martensite phase (I4/mmm1′). The martensitic distortion
is usually driven by a tetragonal strain acting on the Mn coordination polyhedra like a
Jahn-Teller distortion as shown in Fig. 1. This local eﬀect is known to occur in perovskite
oxides, and was also observed in the Ni2MnGa system from neutron diﬀraction experiments
and asserted as a band Jahn-Teller eﬀect.[25, 26] For some compositions, the martensitic
transformation is also associated with a periodic shift of speciﬁc lattices planes that can
give rise to commensurate and incommensurate structure modulations.[11, 21–23, 27] These
displacive modulations can be viewed as a way for the lattice to maintain the proper geomet-
rical bond requirements and can be compared with the characteristic oxygen tilting patterns
in perovskite materials. [28, 29] Many eﬀorts of the research community were dedicated to
the understanding of the various lattice distortions in perovskite materials[30] and how the
interplay between them leads to functional properties like multiferroicity.[31, 32]
In this paper, we will apply the formalisms generally used in the perovskite materi-
als to the martensitic transformation in Ni2MnGa Heusler alloys.
Depending on com-
position, Ni50Mn45−xZx (Z: Ga, In, Sb, Sn) alloys show a wide range of multifunctional
properties related to the matensitic transformation, ranging from magnetic shape memory
eﬀects,[14, 33, 34] giant magneto- and barocaloric eﬀects [4, 5, 35, 36] to exotic magnetic
properties.[12, 37] These technologically relevant properties arise from the relationship be-
tween diﬀerent degrees of freedom in the material: magnetism, spontaneous strains, dis-
placive modulation and the interplay of these with the system entropy.[5] All resemble the
interaction of the diﬀerent ferroic orderings in multiferroic materials, that is strictly linked to
the coupling of the diﬀerent nuclear and magnetic distortions.[38] It is therefore interesting

to investigate the lattice and magnetic distortions and their coupling. To fulﬁll this purpose,
we start from the experimental observation of the change in the martensitic transformation
path in stoichiometric Ni2MnGa induced by small Co doping. Ni2MnGa can be considered
the archetype of Ni-Mn based Heusler alloys, and has been widely studied in literature.
It undergoes a martensitic transformation from a cubic austenite phase, described with
the Fm3m1′ space group, to a 5M modulated martensite structure below 210 K.[22] The
martensitic transformation is preceded by a “premartensite” phase below 260 K.[10, 26, 39]
This phase can be described as a modulated austenite phase with an incommensurate mod-
ulation vector close to the commensurate (1/3 1/3 0) value (deﬁned with respect to the cubic
parent structure). The nature of this premartensite phase and its role in the martensitic
transformation are still a matter of debate,[40–42] justifying the need of a detailed symmetry
analysis of the transformation.
Two main theories are usually considered when trying to explain the martensitic trans-
formation in Ni2MnGa and related compounds: a soft phonon model[40] and an adaptive
one.[41, 43, 44] In the latter, the modulated martensite phase is described as a long-range
ordered arrangement of nano-domains of the L10 tetragonal structure. The strict geometri-
cal relation between the austenite and martensite lattices, due the conservation of the habit
plane [44], and the minimization of the elastic energy [43] restrict the periodicity of the modu-
lated phases. The adaptive model considers the modulated martensite phase as a metastable
phase and the tetragonal non-modulated L10 phase as the only thermodynamically stable
4martensitic phase.[43, 44]. This model is able to correctly describe the mechanical properties
of the martensite phases together with the magnetic anisotropy. [41, 45, 46] Nevertheless
it also shows some limitation: (i) the observation of incommensurate structures is not well
justiﬁed and are explained by the presence of stacking faults in the ordered twinning pat-
tern; (ii) it does not fully account for the presence of the pre-martensite phase, in which
the tetragonal strain is not quantiﬁable but the modulation satellites are still present; (iii)
it does not explain why the nano-twinning need to be periodic on a large scale, which is
needed to explain the observation of sharp Bragg reﬂections.
The soft-phonon model take into account the experimentally observed softening in the
[ζζ0] TA2 phonon branch at ζ ≈0.33.
[40] This theory has been mainly developed in
the ferroelectic community [47] and it is based on the observation that one, or a limited
number of phonons, posses a lower frequency that decreases with temperature, eventually
becoming unstable at the transition. In its ﬁrst description this theory required a complete
softening of the phonon mode and a classical second order phase transition. [47–49] This
is not the case in Ni2MnGa where an incomplete softening of the unstable phonon and a
ﬁrst order transition are observed. Nevertheless, Krumhansl and Gooding[49] show that the
requirement of a complete softening of the phonon mode and a second order transition is
not a strict requirement and can be overcome, for example, considering a coupling between
the soft phonon mode and spontaneous strains.[50] In the case of Ni2MnGa this theory is
criticized on the lack of a complete phonon softening and on the fact that it fails to explain
the presence of the precursor phase.[40] Recently Gruner et al.
[44] proposed a stricter
relation between the phonon softening and the adaptive nano-twinning.
In this work we will show an experimental proof of a direct coupling between the in-
commensurate modulation (the soft-phonon mode) and the tetragonal strain.
We will
also provide a Landau thermodynamical potential based on the symmetry of the par-
ent austenite phase and the daughter martensite phases that formally shows the phe-
nomenological eﬀect of the latter coupling on the macroscopic properties of this systems,
strengthening the soft-phonon model. These conclusions are based on neutron diﬀraction
data collected on Co doped Ni2MnGa alloys. The macroscopic properties and the sym-
metry of the martensite phase in Ni2MnGa are very sensitive to small variations of the
composition,[11, 12, 21, 23, 24, 36, 51, 52] so that varying the concentration gives the op-
portunity to gain insights on the martensitic transformation. In particular, the substitu-
5tion of Co in the Ni sublattice inﬂuences both magnetic and structural properties of the
alloy,[12, 24, 36, 51, 52] allowing the direct observation of the coupling between the diﬀerent
degrees of freedom.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Ni50−xCoxMn25Ga25 samples (x = 3, 5 nominal) were prepared by arc melting of high pu-
rity elements (99.99%). Ingots were sealed in quartz tubes under 300 mbar of Ar and then
annealed at 1073 K for 5 days. The sample-compositions and uniformity were determined
by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis using a scanning electron microscope. The sto-
ichiometries are Ni46.04Co2.59Mn25.96Ga25.42 and Ni44.54Co4.97Mn25.35Ga25.13. The uniformity
is within 0.05%.
Temperature-dependent magnetization, M(T), measurements were performed with a su-
perconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID) under a 5 mT applied-
ﬁeld in the temperature range 5 ≤T ≤650 K with a 4 Kmin−1 sweeping rate. An oven was
attached to the magnetometer for the high-temperature measurements. The measurements
were carried out in a zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC), ﬁeld-cooling (FC) and ﬁeld-cooled-warming
sequence (FCW).
The neutron powder-diﬀraction data were collected on the time-of-ﬂight WISH diﬀrac-
tometer at the ISIS facility (UK).[53] The powder-sample was loaded in a thin vanadium
sample-holder and measured between 5 and 500 K with a hot-stage closed-circuit refrigerator.
Rietveld reﬁnements were performed using the Jana2006 software,[54] and group theoretical
calculations were carried out with the help of the ISOTROPY Suite.[55, 56] The symmetry-
mode analysis [30, 57] of the martensitic sequence of transitions in Ni2−xCoxMnGa is per-
formed with the help of the ISODISTORT software[55] using the reﬁned paramagnetic (PM)
austenite phases and the relative distorted structures. The Landau thermodynamic potential
was constructed with the help of the ISOTROPY suite[56] and INVARIANT software’s.[58]

M(T) obtained in 5 mT applied ﬁeld for the two samples studied in the present work
are shown in ﬁg. 2. All compositions show a sharp transition above 400 K indicating the
ferromagnetic (FM) Curie temperature of the austenite phase (TA
C). As already reported by
Kanomata et al.,[52] TA
C of the austenite phase increases with increasing Co concentration.
The estimated transition temperatures, 405 and 437 K for x = 3 and 5, respectively, are in
agreement with those given in reference [52]. Both compounds undergo at low temperatures
a martensitic phase transition, which is accompanied by a hysteresis between the FC and
FCW M(T) data. The ZFC state is obtained by cooling the sample from 380 K to the lowest

temperature. Since 380 K corresponds to a temperature within the FM state for these two
samples, and not to a temperature in the PM state, M(T) does not become zero at the lowest
temperature, and a certain ﬁnite value remains. Nevertheless, the splitting between the ZFC
and FCW curves indicates the presence of mixed magnetic exchange with competing non-
FM and FM components. The sample with x = 3 shows two features in M(T) around TI ≈
160 K and TII ≈120 K. The sequence of the transitions resembles the behavior observed
for the Ni2MnGa composition which is characterized by a pre-martensitic transition around
TI ≈260 K followed by the martensitic transformation around TII ≈210 K. [39] On the
other hand the sample with x = 5 exhibits a single transition around 90 K. The details of
these transitions are examined more closely with neutron diﬀraction experiments presented
below.

Neutron diﬀraction
1.
Paramagnetic and ferromagnetic austenite phases
In the paramagnetic state, above TA
C, all the samples are in the cubic L21 phase. Diﬀrac-
tion data obtained at 600 K show very similar patterns for all samples. We show as example
the data obtained for Ni47Co3Mn25Ga25 in ﬁg. 3.
We obtain good reliability factors of
the Rietveld reﬁnements by adopting the Fm3m1′ symmetry. The chemical compositions
obtained from structural reﬁnements (by taking advantage of the good contrast of the scat-
tering cross-section between the elements, with bMn = -3.73 fm, bNi = 10.3 fm bCo = 2.73
fm, and bGa = 7.28 fm) are in agreement with the EDX measurements for all investigated
compounds (see table S I to S V in the supplementary materials). [59]
In ﬁg. 4, we show the neutron-diﬀraction data for Ni47Co3Mn25Ga25 and Ni47Co5Mn25Ga25
obtained at 300 K in the ferromagnetic phase. We observe below TA
C a strong temperature-
dependence of the cubic 111 reﬂection intensity and the absence of extra reﬂections indicating
the presence of a k = (0 0 0) propagation vector for the FM austenite phase (insets ﬁg. 4(a)
and 4(b)). The TA
C obtained as 431(3) K and 449(7) K are slightly higher than the values
obtained from M(T). The magnetic symmetry analysis in the FM state was performed by
referencing to the PM austenite structure and the observed propagation vector; assuming
magnetic ordering of both Ni and Mn sites. The details of the analysis are given in Appendix
A.
It is worth stressing here that although the resolution of the present diﬀraction experiment
is not sensitive enough to detect a possible magneto-elastic coupling, the occurrence of very
small lattice distortions cannot be excluded a priori. The correct symmetry of the magnetic
state is assigned by combining the knowledge of the magnetic anisotropy and symmetry
information associated with the phase transition. Firstly, from the integrated intensity of the
111 reﬂection as a function of temperature and from the absence of thermal hysteresis around
TA
C in M(T) (ﬁg. 2), it is evident that the magnetic transition progresses as second order.
Secondly, literature related to prototypical Ni2MnGa and oﬀ-stoichiometric compositions
indicate the occurrence of a uniaxial type of ferromagnetism along one of the fundamental
[001]C crystallographic axis.[60] These evidences are consistent only with the I4/mm′m′
magnetic space group. For all compositions, the reﬁnements of the tetragonal magnetic

Temperature-induced martensitic transformation
Following the features related to the martensitic transitions in M(T) in ﬁg. 2, neutron
diﬀraction measurements were performed to study in more detail the transitions.
11a.
Ni47Co3Mn25Ga25
Below TI it is possible to observe a splitting of the 200 cubic
reﬂection characteristic of a tetragonal distortion (see ﬁg. 5) as conﬁrmed by whole-pattern
Le Bail reﬁnement. Besides the lattice distortion, the rising of weak reﬂections indicate that
the new phase is modulated (see inset ﬁg. 5). This whole set of new peaks can be indexed
based on a pseudo-austenitic lattice with a modulation vector q ≈(0.3 0.3 0). The values of
the propagation vector and the weak intenities of the satellite reﬂections are characteristic
of the pre-martensitic transformation as observed for Ni2MnGa [10, 25, 39, 61], NiTi [62]
and Ni1−xAlx alloys.[63] However, contrary to the 3% Co sample, the Ni2MnGa system, as
well as NiTi and Ni1−xAlx, does not show any strain in the pre-martensite phase even with
high-resolution synchrotron data.[10, 39]
The modulated state for TII < T < TI is described within the superspace formalism.[64–
66] The observed systematic absences of the main and satellite reﬂections allows to undoubt-
edly identify the Immm(00γ)s00 superspace group as the correct symmetry to describe the
crystallographic structure. No evident changes in the magnetic contribution to the diﬀrac-
tion pattern were observed across the TI transition, indicating small changes in the fer-
romagnetic structure. Previous works indicate, in fact, that the b-axis of the martensite
cell described in this work (corresponding to the cubic [001] direction) is the magnetic easy
axis.[60, 67] A ferromagnetic ordering of the Mn spins along the b direction corresponds to
the magnetic superspace group Im′mm′(00γ)s00. The reﬁnement with the aforementioned
symmetry at 130 K is shown in ﬁg. 5(a) whereas crystal data and atomic positions are
reported in table S VI and S VII respectively.[59]
The reﬁned modulated structure is characterized by a sinusoidal modulation of the x-
position of all the atoms present in the structure with amplitudes very similar to the one
observed in the pre-martensite phase of the stoichiometric Co-free compound[10] (see table
S VII[59] and ﬁg. 6). Although the lattice symmetry is orthorhombic, the reﬁnement of the
cell parameters converged to a tetragonal metric with equal amplitude of the incommensurate
displacement for the Mn and Ga site. As for the austenite phase the ordered moment on the
Ni site can be considered zero within 3σ. It is worth stressing that neutron diﬀraction allows
to determine only the average values of the ordered magnetic moment on the crystallographic
site and not the single value for Ni and Co. Kanomata et al.[52] suggest, from electronic-
structure calculation, the value of ≈1 µB per Co atoms and ≈0.25 µB per Ni that leads
to an average moment on the site of ≈0.3 µB.

The second transition at TII is characterized by a sudden jump of the cell parame-
ters as can be seen in ﬁg. 7. It is worth noting that the modulation vector changes its
periodicity from the almost commensurate position to q ≈(0.38 0.38 0) (deﬁned in the
pseudo-cubic austenite cell). The diﬀraction data indicate that the transition is of the ﬁrst
order with a clear phase coexistence as observed in the reﬁnement of the 120 K data (see
ﬁgure S1).[59] There is no evidence in the diﬀraction pattern of any extra reﬂections, ruling
out the possibility of a violation of the current symmetry and the stabilization of a new
modulation/superstructure. The diﬀraction data indicate that the transformation is driven
by the tetragonal and orthorhombic lattice strains solely, excluding symmetry change and
deﬁning it as an isomorphic transition. The reﬁnement at 5 K was then conducted in the
Im′mm′(00γ)s00 superspace space group. The resulting Rietveld plot is shown in ﬁg. 5
whereas the crystal information are available in table S VII and S IX.[59] The reﬁned crys-
tal structure is very similar to the martensite phase below TI with larger amplitudes of the
sinusoidal modulation (twice as big) and larger strains. Very weak, second order satellites
were observed, but their intensity can be reproduced with the ﬁrst order harmonic modula-

tion described in table S IX. [68, 69] As for the TI phase, the magnetism is mostly related
to the Mn site, and the size of the moment does not change signiﬁcantly with respect to
the other two phases. The reﬁnement of the moment on the Ni site converges to a ﬁnite
value with statistical signiﬁcance. Nevertheless, the observed moment is very small and the
reﬁnement reliability factors do not change signiﬁcantly with the additional parameters.It
is possible in any case to conclude that the Ni-site probably shows a ferromagnetic arrange-
ment with respect to the Mn spins (reﬁnement with an AFM coupling has higher reliability
factor and eventually converges back to the FM alignment) with a small ordered moment
around 0.2 µB, in agreement with the electronic-structure calculation in Ref. [52].

Ni45Co5Mn25Ga25
The neutron diﬀraction data collected on the 5% Co sample con-
ﬁrm the presence of a single transition at TII ≈90 K as observed from the magnetization
data (ﬁg. 2). Analogous to the lower doping concentration, a tetragonal splitting of the 200
reﬂection is evident (see ﬁg. 8) together with the appearance of weak satellite reﬂections as

can be seen, for instance, around the 111 reﬂection of the cubic austenite (see inset ﬁg. 8).
Diﬀerently form the transition at TII in the 3% Co sample, the change of the lattice pa-
rameter is abrupt underlining a ﬁrst order transition, conﬁrmed also by the observed phase
coexistence and from the thermal hysteresis in the magnetization measurements (Fig. 2).
This transition clearly resembles the TII transition in the 3% Co compound, but the features
of the modulation are more related to the ﬁrst martensitic phase observed below TI in the
3% Co sample, namely the value of the modulation vector and the weak satellite reﬂections.
The martensite phase was reﬁned against the data collected at 5 K in the Im′mm′(00γ)s00
magnetic superspace group. The crystal data and the atomic positions are reported in Table
S X and S XI respectively,[59] whereas a Rietveld plot of the reﬁnement at 5 K is shown
in Fig. 8. As for the other martensitic phases only the sinusoidal modulation wave for each
position were reﬁned, and the obtained values are in the middle of the ones observed in
the 3% Co phases. The lattice shows a slight orthorhombic distortion, and the ferromag-
netic arrangement of the Mn moment is retained across the martensite transformation. The

reﬁnements yield a very small moment on the Ni/Co sublattice, but also in this case, the
statistical relevance of the result is very limited. Fig. 9 shows the thermal evolution of the
lattice parameters and of the modulation vector showing the ﬁrst order martensitic trans-
formation at TII. In this case, the modulation vector at the beginning show a sharp rise
followed from an almost constant value around the commensurate position 1/3.

DISCUSSION
The high resolution neutron diﬀraction data hereby reported allows to gain important
insights on the martensitic transformation. To obtain these information we performed a
mode decomposition analysis[30, 57] of the experimentally reﬁned structures. Such analysis
supplies the decomposition of the distorted structure in terms of symmetry-adapted modes,
allowing the identiﬁcation of the distortions hierarchy and elucidate the driving mechanisms

of the transitions.[30, 57]
The mode decomposition analysis,[30, 57] performed on the ferromagnetic austenite
phases, indicates that the sole mΓ+
4 mode assumes ﬁnite amplitude, which is directly pro-
portional to the Mn and Ni magnetic moment. As pointed out previously, no changes of the
magnetic structure were detected from the neutron data at the martensitic transformations
indicating that the magnetic degree of freedom is not pivotal in these transitions.
The results of the mode analysis across the martensitic transitions temperatures for both
compounds are shown in ﬁg. 10. In the top panels the total amplitude of the displacive
modulation Σ2 mode is shown.
This symmetry mode is related to the incommensurate
sinusoidal displacement, and its amplitude is proportional to the order parameter η. On the
lower panels the amplitudes of the tetragonal and orthorhombic strains are reported. These
two modes are described by the Γ+
3 and Γ+
5 representations respectively and their amplitudes
are proportional to the order parameters ξ and σ. By looking to the amplitudes in ﬁg. 10,
the Σ2 mode represents the main distortion, being six times greater than the tetragonal
17strain Γ+
3 and two order of magnitude bigger than the orthorhombic strain Γ+
5 . This simple
evaluation allows identifying the η (Σ2 mode) and the ξ (Γ+
3 modes) order parameters as
the driving distortions featuring the austenite to martensite phase transition.
The temperature dependence of the two order parameters across the transitions draws an
interesting scenario. In the 3% doped sample, at TI, η follows a power law dependence with a
critical exponent β = 0.52(5) (ﬁg. 10). Interestingly, the tetragonal strain ξ, below TI, starts
to increase linearly in the same temperature-range indicating a close correlation with the
modulation amplitude evolution. Speciﬁcally, the strain order parameter ξ is a secondary
order parameter induced by the displacive modulation η, at least in this temperature range.
The two order parameters are coupled, by symmetry, with a linear quadratic invariant ξη2
ruling the experimentally observed temperature behavior. At TII in the 3% Co sample,
both distortion modes present a clear discontinuity indicating a ﬁrst order transition. In
the 5% doped sample, a single ﬁrst order transition is observed, in which the Σ2 and Γ+
3
modes follow the same temperature evolution, again indicating a strong coupling between
the order parameters.
It is possible to rationalize these observation within the Landau phenomenological the-
ory and show that the martensitic transformation can be described within the soft phonon
model. The symmetry constrained Landau free energy potential F(η, ξ) for the orthorhom-
bic martensite transition is described in Appendix B and we refer to that for details. The
mode decomposition clearly indicates the presence of two strongly coupled primary order pa-
rameters in the martensitic transformation. Moreover, the presence of two clear transitions
in the 3% Co compound but also in the parent Ni2MnGa [25, 39] and other alloy compo-
sitions indicate that both order parameter present a clear instability, which takes place at
diﬀerent characteristic temperatures mainly depending on the lattice structure and chemical
composition. In the 3% Co system, as well in Ni2MnGa, the martensitic transition develops
in two steps. First, the ’pre-martensite’ phase appears: this phase transition is driven only
by the displacive order parameter η, and the tetragonal strain appears as secondary order
parameter as observed in the 3% Co sample as well as in Pt doped samples,[11]. The ’pre-
martensite’ phase in the parent compound Ni2MnGa [25, 39] do not show any measurable
tetragonal strain nevertheless being allowed by symmetry it will be present. Further de-
crease in the temperature induces the “proper” martensite transition that is related to the
strain instability.[25, 39] In both the Ni2MnGa system and in the 3% Co doped composition
18but also in Pt doped samples,[11] the prominent increase of the strain (see TII in Fig. 10)
induces a renormalization of the modulation amplitude and an increase of the modulation
vector component as well. It is then possible to consider both these transitions as two dis-
tinct martensitic transformations: the ﬁrst one driven solely by the displacive modulation
and the second one by the lattice strain.
These features can be explained by considering the linear quadratic coupling −d1ξη2
present in the Landau free energy (see Appendix B) and how this eﬀects the martensitic
transition. Let’s deﬁne Tη and Tξ the characteristic temperatures of the order parameters.
When Tξ is close to Tη, like in the 3 %Co compound, the ξη2 coupling term can re-normalizes
the quadratic coeﬃcient of the displacement order parameter as (a2
2 −d1ξ)η2 [31, 70, 71].
The a2 parameter can be described within the soft phonon mode as m∗ω2
0, where omega
is the frequency of the soft mode and m∗is its eﬀective mass. In the soft phonon model
the frequency ω0 should continuously decrease to zero following the law ω0 = [a2,0(T−TC)
m∗
]

2.
Experimentally this is not the case since a ﬁrst order phase transition is observed in both
Co doped compounds as well as an incomplete softening of the unstable phonon is observed
in the parent Ni2MnGa alloys [40]. Nevertheless if we consider the presence of the linear
quadratic coupling −d1ξη2 and if the coupling coeﬃcient d1 is large enough the transitions
become of the ﬁrst order.[31, 49, 50, 70, 71] Of course there might be other reasons for
the transition to be of the ﬁrst order type, as explained in Appendix B, nonetheless the
experimental observation of the coupling between the orders parameters indicate it as the
more likely candidate to explain the incomplete softening and the ﬁrst order character of
the incommensurate displacement transition.
It is now interesting to analyze the situation where Tξ > Tη. For T > Tξ > Tη both a1
and a2 parameters (see appendix B for deﬁnitions) are positive and the austenite phase is
the minimum of F(η, ξ). For Tη < T < Tξ the a1 term became negative indicating that
the thermodynamic potential has a minimum for a ﬁnite value of the tetragonal strain. In
this case, if d1ξ < a2(T)
2
the renormalized quadratic coeﬃcient of the displacive modulation
assume a negative value and the transition to the modulated state occurs although the
temperature is higher than the characteristic temperature Tη.
This scenario is likely to
happen in case of strongly ﬁrst order transitions of the lattice strain as shown by Toledano
in the case of the nuclear transition in benzyl [72] and in a more general way from Salje et
al.[31] regarding multiferroic phase transitions. In these conditions the two strongly coupled
19order parameters will follow the same temperature behaviour[31] as observed in the 5%
doped compound (see ﬁg. 10 right side), but more importantly as it is been observed in the
martensitic transformation of Ni-Mn-X (X=In, Sn, Sb) metamagnetic alloys.[35, 73, 74]

CONCLUSION
The symmetry of the martensitic transformation in the Ni-Mn-Ga and related compounds
has been discussed in detail, starting from the experimental observation of the martensitic
transformation in Co doped sample of Ni2MnGa and from the description of the latter
through a symmetry constrained thermodynamic potential. The analysis allows a straight-
forward description of the properties and characteristic of the transformation, highlighting
the fundamental role played by the linear quadratic coupling between the displacement and
the tetragonal strain. The experimental observation of this coupling points to a primary
role of the displacive modulation in the martensitic transformation. The observation of a
martensite phase in which the tetragonal strain appears as a secondary order parameter
induced by the displacive modulation indicate that the latter can not be induced by the
tetragonal twinning in disagreement with the adaptive model.
The −d1ξη2 coupling also act as a renormalization on the displacement transition temper-
ature explaining the strong ﬁrst ordered martensitic transformation observed in the meta-
magnetic Ni-Mn-X composition as well as the stress induced martensite transition. It is
also worth mentioning that the application of an external tetragonal strain to the austenite
phase, for example as uniaxial stress along [001] cubic direction, can trigger the martensite
transition to the incommensurate state thanks to the same coupling invariant, whereas the
application of isotropic pressure will promote the austenitic phase. Clearly, the engineering
and the control of the lattice strains become pivotal to the design of the material proper-
ties, and the stability and the composition of the austenitic lattice, in particular of the fcc
sublattices, will determine the characteristic of the transformation.

Mn and Ni sub-lattices. The symmetry analysis leads to six possible magnetic space groups
deriving from the mΓ+
4 irreducible representation (Irreps) with diﬀerent order parameter
directions (ODP) (see table I). The corresponding magnetic structures are reported in ﬁg.
11, in all the cases the relative orientation of the spins is ferromagnetic within each sub-
lattice, but with diﬀerent magnetic anisotropy direction and induced strain components, in
agreement with the magnetic symmetry. As example in the present case the magnetic space
group I4/mm′m′ allows the occurrence of spontaneous strains in the lattice. In particular
it allows the tetragonal strain Γ+
3 (ξ) that is induced from the primary magnetic mode µ.
This magneto-elastic coupling is described in the system free energy by the linear quadratic
coupling term ξµ2 and gives the possibility to control the spontaneous tetragonal strain with
an external magnetic ﬁeld as observed in magnetic-shape memory alloys.[14] In the present
work this magneto-elastic coupling is not directly observed in the diﬀraction data but being
allowed by symmetry, it will have a ﬁnite value.
Appendix B: Landau free energy for the martensitic transformation: orthorhombic
case
The mode decomposition reported in the main text indicates two main distortions driving
the two martensitic transformations. The Landau free energy for the phase transition is
envisaged to be composed by these two distortions: (i) the tetragonal strain that transform
as the two dimensional irreducible representation Γ+
3 (ξ) (ii) the incommensurate displacive
21FIG. 11.
Sketch of the magnetic structures derived from the parent Fm3m1′ symmetry, corre-
sponding to the action of the mΓ+
4 Irreps having diﬀerent order parameter direction and magnetic
anisotropy (see table 1). The purple planes in the monoclinic magnetic space groups indicate the
anisotropy
distortion that transform as the twelve dimensional Σ2 (η) irreducible representation . In
ﬁrst approximation, the magnetic order parameter can be considered unchanged across the
structural transition as the ordering temperature falls considerably far from the martensite
transition. For these reason we exclude it from the description. The symmetry-constrained
free energy can be written as follows:
F(η, ξ) = a1
2 ξ2 + b1
3 ξ3 + c1
4 ξ4 + a2
2 η2 + c2
4 η4 −d1ξη2
(B1)
where a1 = a1,0(T −Tξ) and a2 = a2,0(T −Tη). The a2 coeﬃcient can be related to the
22softening of the unstable phonon mode along the [δ δ 0] line of the Brillouin zone. Cochran
[47] suggested that, close to the critical temperature, the square of the phonon frequency
decrease linearly following mω2
0 ∝(T −TC). Is then possible to relate the a2 coeﬃcient in
equation B1 to the phonon frequency ω0 thought:
ω0 = [a2,0(T −Tη)
m∗
]

(B2)
In its ﬁrst description the soft phonon mode described second order transition with a
complete softening of the unstable phonon modes[47], but it has been shown that the model
can be extended to ﬁrst order transitions explaining the incomplete softening.[49, 50]. The
Landau potential described in equation B1 allows the transition of the η order parameter to
be of the second order, nevertheless either the presence of coupling terms between the order
parameters or c2 < 0, considering the sixth degree invariant in η, can make the transition
ﬁrst order.
The linear quadratic term −d1ξη2 deﬁnes the coupling between the displacive modulation
Σ2 and the tetragonal strain Γ+
3 . By symmetry, a second linear quadratic coupling is allowed
between the displacive modulation and the orthorhombic strain Γ+
5 (σ), but the observation
of small values for the latter in most of the Heusler systems allows us to discard this term
without loss of information. It is worth noting that such thermodynamic potential described
here is quite common in solid-state physics,[71, 75] for example in magneto-structural tran-
sition in 3d-metal monoxides[76, 77], in the ferroelastic/ferroelectric transition in benzyl[72]
or even in the crystallization of icosahedral quasicrystal.[78].
This symmetry-constrained thermodynamic potential allows three stable phases with dif-
ferent symmetries: the austenite parent phase (0,0) with Fm3m1′symmetry, the tetragonal
non modulated martensite (0,ξ) described in the I4/mmm1′ space group corresponding to
the L10 structure, and the modulated martensite phase (η,ξ) with the Im′mm′(00γ)s00
symmetry.
