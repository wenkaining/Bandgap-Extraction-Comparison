Abstract
In this paper, a recently developed Higher Order Microplane (HOM) model for softening and localization, is implemented
within a isogeometric ﬁnite element framework. The HOM model was derived directly from a three dimensional discrete
particle model and it was shown to be associated with a high order continuum characterized by independent rotation
and displacement ﬁelds. Furthermore, the HOM model possesses two characteristic lengths: the ﬁrst associated with the
spacing of ﬂaws in the material internal structure and related to the gradient character of the continuum; and the second
associated with the size of these ﬂaws and related to the micro-polar character of the continuum. The displacement-based
ﬁnite element implementation of this type of continua requires C1 continuity both within the elements and at the element
boundaries. This motivated the implementation of the concept of isogeometric analysis which ensures a higher degree of
smoothness and continuity. NURBS based isogeometric elements were implemented in a 3D setting, with both displacement
and rotational degrees of freedom at each control point. The performed numerical analyses demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of
the proposed HOM model implementation to ensure optimal convergence in both elastic and softening regime. Furthermore,
the proposed approach allows the natural formulation of a localization limiter able to prevent strain localization and spurious
mesh sensitivity known to be pathological issues for typical local strain-softening constitutive equations.

The nonlinear and fracturing behavior of quasi-brittle, heterogeneous materials such as ﬁber reinforced composites, toughened
ceramics, and cementitious composites, among many others, is governed by weak spots and defects of their internal structures

1which cause initiation of cracks and localization of damage. In order to model such behavior, one can use discrete particle
models or continuum models. Each type of model has its own advantages and disadvantages.
In discrete particle models, the internal structure of materials is directly simulated through its geometric approximation
and accounts for the actual intrinsic randomness speciﬁc of the selected length scale. Particles replicate the eﬀect of major
heterogeneities and their interaction is formulated by contact algorithms or through inter-particle lattice struts whose con-
stitutive behavior models speciﬁc physical mechanisms. As such, discrete models have the advantage that many microscopic
eﬀects can be accounted for in a straightforward manner. However, they often lead to large computational systems, especially
to simulate real structures, and require a signiﬁcant, often overwhelming, amount of computational resources.
Continuum models are computationally less expensive. But most of the continuum models are based on the Cauchy
continuum which cannot take into account features of the internal structure and does not possess a characteristic length.
These type of models have some well-known drawbacks. First of all, they are not able to produce a mathematically well-posed
problem in the softening regime causing strong mesh sensitivity in the numerical results [1, 2]. Secondly, the dispersive nature
of wave propagation, typical of many heterogeneous materials, can not be reproduced. Furthermore conventional continuum
formulations predict unrealistic stress singularities at the tip of sharp cracks and fail to simulate size eﬀect phenomena
correctly [3, 4].
In order to overcome these drawbacks, non-local continuum theories have been proposed in the literature. A popular
approach consists in enriching continua with high order strain and stresses. Cosserat brothers’ study [5] was one of the initial
attempt in this direction. They considered independent rotational degrees of freedom, modeling smaller scale kinematics, in
addition to translational degrees of freedom. Later, the couple-stress theory was developed by Toupin [6]. In this model the
only independent ﬁeld is the displacement ﬁeld that also determines the rotations. Eringen developed the so-called micropolar
continuum theory [7] and non-local elasticity [8]. Another type of high-order theory incorporate higher order gradients of
displacements, mostly second gradient (strain gradient) and sometimes higher, into the constitutive model [6].
Mindlin
[9, 10, 11] proposed an enhanced elastic theory with microstructural eﬀects by considering the potential energy density as
a quadratic form of gradient of strain in addition to quadratic form of strains. Aifantis and coworkers [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
introduced a simpliﬁed gradient elasticity theory with one internal length scale which incorporates Laplacian of strain to
enrich the continuum. They applied it for investigation of crack tips, localization of shear bands and to simulate size eﬀect
in torsion and bending. Various forms of gradient elasticity and their performance in static and dynamic applications are
discussed by Askes and Aifantis [17]. They also provide a procedure for the identiﬁcation of the relevant characteristic
lengths. In this work, the ﬁnite element implementation of gradient elasticity was also discussed.
Chang et. al [4] developed a high-order gradient model based on a discrete particle structure, which includes both high-
order strains and stresses. They investigated the possibility of formulating high-order constitutive equations with and without
high order stresses. They found that, contrarily to the model with high-order stresses, the one without is unstable. Misra
and Yang [18] developed a model for cohesive materials based on microstructural concepts. They considered a representative
volume of material as a collection of grains interacting through inter-granular force displacement relations. Inter-granular force
2displacement relations are formulated based on atomistic-level particle interactions. These force displacement relationships
are then used to derive the incremental stress-strain relationship of a representative volume of material. Later Yang et.
al [19] applied this type of microstructural granular based higher-order continuum theory to model the failure behavior
of nanophased ceramics. They compared results obtained from the ab initio simulations with the result of higher-order
continuum theory with good agreement.
Nonlinear nonlocal constitutive equations were also proposed without enrichment of the elastic part and by using integral
or gradient approaches to enrich plasticity and damage theories. Integral type models are based replacing a local variable
with its weighted spatial averaging over a certain volume of material. Pijaudier-Cabot and Baˇzant [20] pioneered research in
this area. On the contrary, gradient plasticity or gradient damage models are based on enriching state variables with high-
order terms. A phenomenological strain gradient plasticity theory was developed by Fleck and Hutchinson [21] in the context
of couple-stress theory where only rotational part of strain gradients is taken into account. They extended the classical J2
plasticity to account for strain gradient eﬀects. Later they reformulated their model and included also stretch gradients in
addition to rotational ones [22]. They investigated their model performance by applying it to the simulation of size eﬀect on
torsion of wires, sheet bending, indentation and void growth. Later, the so-called mechanism based theory of strain gradient
plasticity (MSG) [23, 24] was proposed on the basis of a multiscale framework linking statistically stored and geometrically
necessary dislocations to plastic strains and strain gradient. A reformulation of mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity
was given by [25] that involves the third-order tensor of higher-order stress to a much simpler version within Fleck and
Hutchinson’s theoretical framework of strain gradient plasticity theory. Huang et al. [26] provide a conventional theory of
mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity where the plastic strain gradient appears only in the constitutive model, and the
equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are the same as the conventional continuum models. Jiang et al. [27] studied
on fracture employing mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity.
Finite element implementation of material models that includes second gradient of displacements as degrees of freedom,
require C1 continuity at the inter-element boundaries or mixed element formulation in which both kinematic and static
variables are deﬁned as degrees of freedom. Papanicolopulos et al. [28], Zervos et al. [29] developed C1 type ﬁnite element
for gradient elasticity.
Fischear et al.
[30] implemented isogeometric analysis for gradient elasticity in two dimensions.
On the contrary, in mixed formulations, C0 continuity element can be used but in this case ﬁrst derivatives should be
interpolated in addition to displacements which leads to formulations with a large number of degrees of freedom. These
types of elements can be non-conforming and are required to fulﬁll the patch test [31, 32, 33]. Furthermore, Ru and Aifantis
[34] developed a strategy based on operator split method for their simpliﬁed strain gradient model, in which the fourth-order
partial diﬀerential equations of gradient elasticity are split into two separate second-order partial diﬀerential equations and
they implement it using C0 ﬁnite element.

Higher Order Microplane Model
Classical microplane model formulations, pionered by Baˇzant and coworkers [35, 36], assume that nonlinear phenomena such
as, but not limited to, fracture, shearing, and plastic deformations occur on speciﬁc orientations within the internal structure
of the material. Therefore, microplane models simulate these phenomena through vectorial constitutive laws formulated on
the so called “microplanes” representing generic orientations in space. The strain vector on a generic microplane is obtained
by projecting the strain tensor onto a local system of reference and the stress tensor is computed from tractions on all possible
orientations in space through an energetic equivalence.
The initial formulations of microplane models focused on concrete materials and the most recent one, labeled as M7
[37], has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reproduce typical experimental data relevant to a large variety of loading
conditions, from tension to conﬁned compression; from quasi-static to highly dynamic conditions. Microplane models have
also been successfully developed for other materials such as rock [38]; rigid foam and shape memory alloys [39, 40]; ﬁber
reinforced concrete [41]; as well as composite laminates [42, 41, 43].
The aforementioned microplane formulations are “local” in the sense that the stress tensor at a given point is only function
of the strain tensor at the same point. Unfortunately, such constitutive equations suﬀer from mesh sensitivity and spurious
energy dissipation [44] when softening behavior is simulated. To overcome this problem, nonlocal microplane models were
proposed by various authors [45, 46, 47] by exploiting integral methods, in which the nonlinear behavior at one point depends
on a weighted average of the strain in the neighborhood of that point. These approaches while preventing mesh sensitivity
quite eﬀectively lead to a signiﬁcant increase of the computational cost of simulations.
An alternative to integral microplane models is to adopt strain-gradient formulations such as the ones proposed by Kuhl
et Al. [48, 49] and, more recently, by Cusatis and Zhou [50]. In the latter, starting from a discrete particle model, they
derived a high order microplane (HOM) theory which includes Cosserat theory and strain gradients elasticity as a special
cases. The HOM model possess two characteristic lengths: the ﬁrst associated with the spacing of ﬂaws in the material
internal structure and related to the gradient character of the continuum; and the second associated with the size of these
ﬂaws and related to the micro-polar character of the continuum.
Following Cusatis and Zhou [50], one can calculate microplane strains and curvatures as
εβ = P β
ijγij + r0Pβ
ijkΓijk;
χβ = P β
ijκij;
β = N, M, L
(1)
where γij = uj,i −ϵijkϕk is the strain tensor, κij = ϕj,i is the curvature tensor; Γijk = γij,k is the strain gradient tensor also
referred to as high order strain tensor; ui, ϕi are displacement and rotation, respectively, at a generic position xi (i = 1, 2, 3)
in a 3D continuum. The second order tensor P β
ij = eN
i eβ
j and the third order tensor Pijk = eN
i eβ
j eN
k denote projection
operators for strain and strain gradient, respectively, in which eβ
i (β = N, M, L) are unit vectors deﬁning a local system of
reference on each microplane (see Fig 1). The characteristic length r0, assumed to be a material property, can be interpreted
to be the average half spacing of weak spots in the material internal structure[50].
4By using appropriate vectorial constitutive equations, the microplane stresses and microplane couple stresses can be
calculated from the microplane strains and microplane curvatures: formally, one can write σβ = Fβ(ϵN, ..., χN, ...) and
µβ = Gβ(ϵN, ..., χN, ...), which can be used to obtain stress, couple stress, and high order stress tensors as
σij = 3
4π

µij = 3
4π
Z
Γ1
µβP β

Σijk = 3r0
4π
Z
Γ1
σβPβ
ijkdS
(2)
where the integrals are calculated over the surface of a unit sphere, Γ1; β = N, M, L; and summation rule applies over β.
Furthermore, stress, couple stress, and high order stress tensors must satisfy the conservation of linear and angular
momenta which reads
πji,j + bi = 0;
µji,j + ϵijkπjk = 0
(3)
where πij = σij −Σijk,k is the so-called eﬀective stress tensor; bi denote body forces and moments; and ϵijk is the Levi-Civita
permutation symbol.
The weak form of equilibrium that is used for the ﬁnite elelemnt formulation read

(4)
Finally, the diﬀerential boundary value problem presented above must be completed with appropriate boundary condi-
tions. With reference to Fig. 2, one can write, on the volume boundary, πjinj −Dj (Σijknk) + (Dlnl) hi = ¯ti or ui = ¯ui,
Σijknjnk = ¯hi or Dui = D¯ui, (µji −ϵpkiΣpkj) nj = ¯mi or ϕi = ¯ϕi, and JrinkΣpkjK = ¯ci, where ni is the unit vector orthogo-
nal to the boundary, Di ≡(δij −ninj)∂/∂xj is the surface gradient diﬀerential operator, δij = Kronecker delta, ¯ti=applied
tractions, ¯ui=applied displacements, ¯hi=applied moment energetically conjugate to Dui, Dui = ui,jnj is the displacement
normal derivative, D¯ui = applied displacement normal derivative, ¯mi=applied moments energetically conjugate to rotations,
¯ϕi=applied rotations, ¯ci = applied edge traction acting along a sharp edge, J·K is the jump operator deﬁned on a sharp edge,
rj = ϵpqjspnq, and si is the unit vector tangent to a sharp edge (See Fig. 2). Detailed derivation of Eqs. 3 and boundary
conditions can be found in Cusatis and Zhou [50].

Isogeometric ﬁnite element implementation
3.1
Isogeometric Description of Geometry
Isogeometric analysis (IGA), introduced by Hughes et al. [51], combines computer aided design (CAD) and ﬁnite element
method (FEM) technologies. In IGA, the basis functions used in CAD to describe exactly the geometry of a certain volume
of material are also used to discretize ﬁeld variables describing, for example, its deformation and mechanical behavior. CAD
technologies commonly employ Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) basis functions which are built from B-splines
5[52]. B-splines are piecewise polynomials composed of a linear combination of basis functions deﬁned recursively as
N p
i (ξ) =
ξ −ξi
ξi+p −ξi
N p−1
i
(ξ) +
ξi+p+1 −ξ
ξi+p+1 −ξi+1
N p−1
i+1 (ξ)
(5)
where i = 1, ..., n; n and p are number and maximum order, respectively, of the basis functions. The knots vector, X =
{ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξn+p+1} is a set of non-decreasing real numbers called knots and representing coordinates in the parameter domain.
If all knots are equally spaced, the knot vector is called uniform, otherwise they are non-uniform. For p = 0, N 0
i (ξ) = 1
if ξ is contained in the interval [ξi, ξi+1], and N 0
i (ξ) = 0 otherwise. For p = 1 B-spline basis functions are identical to
basis function of classical constant-strain ﬁnite element formulations. B-spline basis functions are linearly independent, have
partition of unity property and their support is compact. However, they, in general, do not satisfy Kronecker delta property
unless coincident knots exists in X. A B-spline is said to be open if its ﬁrst and last knots appear p + 1 times. Open knot
vectors are interpolatory at the end knots which means they satisﬁes Kronecker delta property at those knots [53].
B-splines cannot represent some common geometrical shapes, such as circular and ellipsoidal sections, exactly. This can
be achieved by using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), which can be deﬁned in terms of B-spline basis functions
as follows:
Rp
i (ξ) =
N p
i (ξ)
Pn
j=1 N p
j (ξ)wj
(6)
where wj are weighting factors that are selected depending upon the type of curve to be represented exactly [51, 53].
A NURBS curve can in general deﬁned as linear combinations of the the functions deﬁned in Eq. 6. Hence, in 3D, the
generic position vector x = [x1 x2 x3]T can be expressed as
x(ξ, η, ζ) =

direction X = {ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξn+p+1} , Y = {η1, η2, ..., ηm+q+1} and Z = {ζ1, ζ2, ..., ζk+r+1}; xI ≡xijk is the position vector
of a control point I (a.k.a. node, per the usual computational mechanics terminology) deﬁned on a 3D grid (i = 1, .., n,
j = 1, .., m, k = 1, .., l) associated to the knot vectors X, Y, and Z; Ncp = m × n × l is the total number of control points.
3.2
Implementation of isogeometric element
In this study a isogeometric ﬁnite element is implemented in 3D with interpolation of displacement and rotational ﬁelds
assumed to be independent. This element features 6 degrees of freedom (3 displacement and 3 rotations) at each control
point. Following the isoparametric concept, the displacement ﬁeld u and rotation ﬁeld ϕ are formulated using the same
NURBS basis functions of the geometry and, for a given element, they can be approximated in terms of element’s control
6point displacements and rotations as follows
u =
Ncp
X
I=1
RIue
I
Φ =
Ncp
X
I=1
RIϕe
I
(9)
where Ncp is the number of control points that are supported by one element and ue = [uxi, uyi, uzi] denotes the nodal
displacement vector and ϕe = [ϕxi, ϕyi, ϕzi] the nodal rotation vector. It is worth nothing that in this study the adopted
shape functions in Eq. 9 are quadratic which can be obtained from Eq. 8 with p = q = r = 2 and Ncp = 27 control points per
element. In Eq. 9 and throughout the rest of the paper, the shape function superscripts are dropped for clarity of notation.
Low and high order strain ﬁelds are obtained computing the spatial derivatives of the displacement ﬁeld:
e = Lde = LRde = Bde
(10)
where e = [γij, κij, Γijk]T is the strain vector collecting all the strains, curvature and high order strain components (45
in total), d is the displacement vector, d = [ui, φi] collecting all degrees of freedom of the element (6 × Ncp in total), L
is a diﬀerential operator, R is the shape function matrix and B is the strain-displacement matrix obtained by applying
the diﬀerential operator L to the shape functions. The B matrix can be subdivided into sub-matrices for low-order and
high-order terms and the separate contribution of diﬀerent nodes:

where s = [σij, µij, Σijk]T is the stress vector collecting all components of the stress tensor, couple stress tensor and high

quadrature rules for IGA [54, 55, 56], in this study, Gauss quadrature is used and number of Gauss points in each direction
is assumed equal to be 1 plus the order of basis function in each direction, that is three for quadratic element which leads to
27 Gauss points per element. Gauss quadrature was originally developed for polynomial function, but it has been employed
successfully for IGA element as well [51, 53].
It is important to point out that the proposed element formulation implicitly assumes that the high order surface moments
h conjugate to the normal gradient of the displacement ﬁeld (see Sec. 2 and Fig. 2) are zero. This is due to the fact that
only displacement and rotation degrees of freedom are introduced and no kinematic boundary conditions can be imposed on
the normal gradient of displacements.

Numerical Results
The performance of the proposed isogeometric implementation of the high order microplane model is demonstrated in this
section with reference to classical examples for gradient elasticity, Cosserat elasticity and strain softening.
4.1
Strain gradient elasticity solution of cantilever beam problems
The exact analytical solution [57] for a cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated load at the free end is used here as a
reference for comparison with the strain gradient version of the high order microplane model. To obtain the macroscopic
constitutive equations used to derive the exact solution, the microplane constitutive equation for gradient elasticity are
formulated as follows:
σN = EV εV + EDεD + EΓ

σM = ET εγ

N −εV , and EV , ED, ET are volumetric, deviatoric and shear elastic moduli, respectively. As
already shown by Cusatis and Zhou [Ref], Eq. 15 lead to classical elastic constitutive equations if r0 = 0, EV = E/(1 −2ν)
and ED = ET = E/(1 + ν) where E = Young’s modulus and ν = Poisson’s ratio. With the formulation in Eq. 15, the
8microplane integration (see Eq. 2) can be done analytically and explicit form of stress, couple stress, and high order stress
tensor can be obtained as follows:
σij = EV ϵV Vij + [EDAijkl + ET (Bijkl + Cijkl)] γkl,

Beskou et al [57] is obtained for the components σ11 and Σ111. It must be observed however that this microplane formulation
leads to other non-zero high order stress components which are absent in the analytical solution.
A cantilever beam, 1000 mm long with 100×25 mm cross-section, is modeled with quadratic isogeometric solid elements.
The beam is discretized with 4 diﬀerent meshes with 10 × 1 × 1, 20 × 2 × 1, 40 × 4 × 1 and 80 × 8 × 2 elements, respectively.
Essential boundary conditions are applied at both ends of the beam. E=25000 MPa, ν=0.2, and 2r0 = 0.2L are assumed
in the calculations. In Fig. 3a the relative displacement (normalized with displacement value obtained from the Cauchy
solution) as a function of position along the beam is given for diﬀerent meshes and compared with analytical result given by
Beskou et al [57]. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that with mesh reﬁnement the tip displacement converges to a certain value.
The overall calculated elastic curve is in general good agreement with the analytical solution, to which, however, it does not
converge exactly. The main reason for this discrepancy is that in the analytical solution, they only consider one high-order
term Γxxx = γxx,x, but the proposed HOM model is a 3D model and it features automatically other high order terms.
Fig. 3b reports the obtained response for diﬀerent values of the internal length scale, r0. As expected, with the increase of
the internal length scale, the beam response becomes stiﬀer. Also, internal length that tends to zero, the response converges
to the classical Bernoulli beam solution.
The second beam example is relevant to an experimental study carried out by Lam et al. [58] on epoxy beams. Tests were
carried out in plane strain conditions on end-point loaded cantilever beams with 20, 38, 75, 115 µm depth and length-to-depth
ratio equal to 10. The elastic properties of the epoxy are reported as E = 1.44 GPa and ν = 0.38 [58]. The microplane
simulations were performed with EΓ
T = ET and EΓ
N = EV and the material characteristic length was optimized according
to the experimental result for the 20 µm beam. The best ﬁt is obtained with 2r0 = 33.2 µm. Based on these material
parameters, the other beams are simulated. 3D quadratic isogeometric elements are used and the beams are discretized with
40 × 4 × 1 elements. In order to provide plane strain condition, the lateral displacement (uz) of nodes on external surfaces
(x-y plane) are restricted. Figure 3c illustrates the change of normalized bending stiﬀness, D = PL3/
 3wbh3
, predicted by
the proposed model and obtained in the experiments. In the deﬁnition of D, P is the applied load; w is the corresponding
displacement; b,h and L are beam thickness, depth and length, respectively. The model can reproduce very well the beam
behavior exhibiting size eﬀect: the smaller the thickness the larger the normalized bending stiﬀness [58]. This behavior can
9not be produced by classical beam, which always gives constant value for bending stiﬀness corresponding to the current
formulation for large thickness values.

Cosserat Solution of a Stress Concentration Problem
The presented high order microplane theory reduced to a Cosserat continuum when the material characteristic length, r0, is
equal to zero, and the microplane constitutive equations are formulated as follows:
σN = EV εV + EDεD;
σM = ET εM;
σL = ET εL
(17)
µN = WV χV + WDχD;
µM = WT χM;
χL = WT χL
(18)
where εV is the volumetric strain, εD = εN −εV , χV = Vijχij, χD = χN −χV . Also in this case, the microplane integration
( Eq. 2) can be done analytically and explicit form of stress and couple stress tensors are obtained as follows:
σij = EV εV Vij + [EDAijkl + ET (Bijkl + Cijkl)] γkl
µij = WV χV Vij + [WDAijkl + WT (Bijkl + Cijkl)] κkl
(19)
where the tensors Vij, Aijkl, Bijkl and Cijkl are the same ones introduced in the previous section. Cusatis and Zhou [50]
derived the relationship between the microplane parameters and the ones of Cosserat elasticity as EV = 3λ + 2µ + χ,
ED = 5µ + χ, ET = χ and WV = 3π1 + π2 + π3, WD = π2 + 4π3, WT = π2 −π3.
In order to demonstrate the eﬃciency of the isogeometric element for the integration of the Cosserat theory, this section
discusses a well-known stress concentration problem consisting of an inﬁnite plate with a circular hole subjected to a uniaxial
far ﬁeld tension. The Cosserat continuum has a characteristic length which arises from the unit mismatch between stresses
and couple stresses. This eﬀects the stress concentration factor around the hole. Analytical solutions of this problem for
classical Cosserat continuum was given by Eringen [59] and for Couple Stress theory by Mindlin [60] in 2D case. In both
references the stress concentration factor is deﬁned as SCF = σx(0, r)/σ∞
x = (3 + F)/(1 + F) where F = [8l2
b/l2
c(1 −ν)]/[4 +
(r/lc)2 + 2(r/lc)K0(r/lc)/K1(r/lc)], r is the radius of the hole, lb = [π3/2 (2µ + χ)]1/2, lc = [(π2 + π3) / (2µ + χ)]1/2 [61] are
the material characteristic lengths, and K0 and K1 are the second kind modiﬁed Bessel functions of order zero and one,
respectively. Mindlin gives exactly the same equation for the case of l2
b/l2
c = 1. Furthermore, it is convenient to deﬁne [61]
the coupling factor, Nc = [χ/2 (µ + χ)] , which is a non-dimensional quantity taking values between 0 and 1. For Nc = 1 the
couple-stress theory is recovered and for Nc = 0 the Cauchy continuum is obtained [61].
This example was also simulated by Pothier and Rencis [61] and Nakamura et. al. [62]. In the ﬁnite element simulations
discussed in this section, the material parameters are taken from Ref. [61] and they are reported in Table 1. Four simulations
with diﬀerent coupling factor are performed by assuming plate dimensions of 300 × 300 × 10 mm and hole radius of 10
mm. Considering the symmetry along the x- and y-axes, only one quarter of the specimen is modeled as shown in Figure 4.
10Applied boundary conditions are also speciﬁed in Figure 4. A 3D ﬁnite element model was set up with quadratic isogeometric
solid element and the IGA meshes was obtained by using IGAFEM [53]. Two diﬀerent meshes are used with 1024 (32 × 32)
and 4096 (64 × 64) elements. For both mesh only one element is used along the thickness. The coarser mesh is shown in Fig.
4 where a zoom-in highlights the geometry of one element and the corresponding control points. Two more layers of control
points are present through the thickness (for a total of 27 control points) but they are not visible in the ﬁgure. Table 2
presents the comparison of the obtained stress concentration factors with the analytic solution. The results show very good
agreement with analytical values with error less than 3.7 % and 0.9 % for mesh-1 and mesh-2, respectively.
4.3
Localization Behavior of a Softening Bar in Tension
This section presents the simulation of softening behavior with the objective of evaluating the eﬀectiveness of the regular-
ization strategy proposed by Cusatis and Zhou within the presented high order isogeometric implementation [50].
The adopted softening constitutive equation follows the formulation proposed by Cusatis et Al. [63]. The microplane cou-
ple stresses are assumed to be zero µN = µM = µL=0. The microplane stresses are computed with damage-like constitutive
equations as follows
σN = σ
ϵ ϵN
σM = ασ
ϵ εM
σL = ασ
ϵ εL
(20)
where α is a material parameter, σ = (σ2
N + σ2
T /α)1/2 is the eﬀective stress, σT = (σ2
M + σ2
L)1/2 is the total shear stress,
ϵ = (ϵ2
N + αϵ2
T )1/2 is the eﬀective strain, and ϵT = (ϵ2
M + ϵ2
L)1/2 is the total shear strain. In the elastic regime, the eﬀective
stress is proportional to the eﬀective strain: σ = E0ϵ, in which E0 is the microplane normal modulus.
E0 and α can
be related to Young’s modulus, E, and Poisson’s ratio, ν, through the following expressions: E0 = E/(1 −2ν) and α =
(1 −4ν)/(1 + ν). The nonlinear behavior is imposed by computing the eﬀective stress incrementally, ˙σ = E0 ˙ϵ, and satisfying
the inequality 0 ≤σ ≤σbt(ϵ, ω) where σbt = σ0(ω) exp [−H0(ω)⟨ϵ −ϵ0(ω)⟩/σ0(ω)], ⟨x⟩= max{x, 0}, ϵ0(ω) = σ0(ω)/E0, and
tan(ω) = ϵN/√αϵT = σN
√α/σT . The post peak softening modulus is deﬁned as H0(ω) = Ht(2ω/π)nt, where Ht is the
softening modulus in pure tension (ω = π/2) expressed as Ht = 2E0/ (ℓt/ℓ0 −1); ℓt = 2E0Gt/σ2
t ; ℓ0 = 2r0; and Gt is the
mesoscale fracture energy. In the previous equations, the eﬀective strength is formulated in such a way to have a smooth
transition between pure tension (ω = π/2) and pure shear (ω = 0) with parabolic variation in the σN versus σT /√α plane:
σ0(ω) = σtr2
st

−sin(ω)+
q
sin2(ω) + 4α cos2(ω)/r2
st

/[2α cos2(ω)], where rst = σs/σt is the ratio of shear strength to tensile
strength.
By assuming E = 25 GPa, ν = 0.2, r0 = 5 mm, σt =3 MPa, σs/σt =4 MPa, and ℓt =100 mm, a prismatic bar subject
to uniaxial tension is modeled with 3D quadratic isogeometric solid elements. The bar is 100 mm long and has 75 × 75 mm
rectangular cross section. One end of the bar is ﬁxed in all directions and a displacement is prescribed at opposite end in
the longitudinal direction. Four diﬀerent meshes are used with 10 × 1 × 1, 20 × 1 × 1, 40 × 1 × 1 and 80 × 1 × 1 elements. The
microplane stress integration is performed by a Voronoi integration scheme (See Appendix A) with 66 microplane over the
entire unit sphere. In order to control the location of the the localization zone, the central one tenth of the bar is weakened
11by reducing the tensile strength by 10 %.
For comparison, simulations with r0 = 0 are also performed. As one might expect, for r0 = 0 the bar response is mesh
dependent. The load displacement curve is increasingly more brittle (Fig. 5a) as the mesh become more reﬁned and damage
localizes always in one single element as one can see in Fig. 5e where the longitudinal strain proﬁle is plotted for a bar end
displacement of 0.2 mm. Figs. 5b and Fig. 5f show that mesh sensitivity is only partially mitigated for r0 ̸= 0. In this case,
the bar response is increasingly brittle upon mesh reﬁnement immediately after the peak. The solution is less dependent
on the mesh in the softening branch. The strain proﬁle (Fig. 5f does not show the extreme strain localization of the local
simulation but still there is not a clear convergence upon mesh reﬁnement.
Cusatis and Zhou [50] conducted a 1D spectral analysis of localization and proposed to regularize the solution by com-
puting the high order stresses as
Σijk = 3r0
4π
Z
Γ1
(σβ + S0ψβ) P β
ijkdS
(21)
where ψβ = r0P β
ijkΓijk and S0 is the localization limiter.
For the 1D case and for linear softening, one can obtain a
localization band equal to 2r0 if S0 =
 1 + 1/π2
Ht [50]. For exponential softening, in which the softening modulus is not
constant, the localization limiter must be a function of the current value of strain. In this case, and again with reference
to a 1D setting, one can write S0 =
 1 + 1/π2
Ht exp(−Ht⟨ϵ −ϵt⟩) with ϵt = σt/E0. In order to use this 1D result in the
microplane formulation one can write
S0(ϵ, ω) =
 1 + 1/π2
H0(ω) exp(−H0(ω)⟨ϵ −ϵ0(ω)⟩)
(22)
where ω accounts for the presence of shear on the microplanes (see the adopted constitutive equations above).
From the physical point of view, this regularization strategy corresponds to adding, in parallel with the softening mi-
croplane stresses, additional non-softening microplane stresses which ensure that the phase velocity of a propagating uniaxial
wave is always real. It is worth noting that such parallel coupling of softening and elastic components is also intrinsically
captured by the microplane model by virtue of the kinematic constraint (Eq. 1) and the micro-macro stress relation (Eq.
2). This is the reason why partial regularization is attained with r0 ̸= 0 and H0 = 0 (Figs. 5b and 5f)
Figs. 5c and
5g show the obtained response by adopting the formulation in Eqs.
21 and 22.
As one can see, the
initial softening branch is very well regularized. However, the rest of the softening curve shows an oscillatory behavior, the
convergence upon mesh reﬁnement is not clear, and a residual load appear even for relatively large strains (stress locking).
The strain proﬁle does not localize in one element but, again, clear convergence cannot be demonstrated.
The stress locking phenomenon is due to the fact that the additional elastic stresses associated with H0 are added during
the entire simulation, since the beginning when the material has yet to soften. This is clearly unnecessary. An alternative
regularization scheme which avoids this shortcoming can be formulated by introducing the regularization term on the stress
increments as opposed to total stress. In this case Eq. 21 is substituted by the following equations
12dΣijk = 3r0
4π
Z
Γ1
(dσβ + S0dψβ) P β
ijkds;
Σijk =
Z
dΣijk
(23)
where S0 = 0 for ε < ε0(ω) and Eq. 22 holds for ε ≥ε0(ω).
Figs. 5d and 5h shows the results obtained with this incremental formulation. As one can see, both the load displacement
curve and the strain proﬁle along the bar are fully regularized and both show a clear convergence upon mesh reﬁnement.
The localization band is larger than the theoretical 1D value of 2r0. This is due to the intrinsic 3D formulation of the
microplane model which, even under uniaxial tensile macroscopic conditions, feature tensile and shear strains and stresses
at each microplane orientation. The correct estimate of the localization band requires a fully 3D spectral analysis, which,
however is intractable from the analytical point of view (see discussion in Ref. [50]).

Conclusions
This paper presents the isogeometric ﬁnite element implementation of a recently developed High-Order Microplane (HOM)
model. The HOM model was originally derived based on a discrete particle model and the resulting theory includes gradient
elasticity and Cosserat theory as a special cases.
In addition, the HOM model allows for an eﬀective regularization of
softening constitutive equations by means a simple modiﬁcation of the high order stresses. The numerical simulations are
carried out with an isogometric ﬁnite element characterized by 27 control points and 6 degrees of freedom, 3 displacement
components and 3 rotation components, at each control point. The spatial integrals were performed with a gauss quadrature
scheme with 27 gauss points and the microplane integration was carried out by a novel integration scheme based on the
Voronoi discretization of the unit sphere with 66 microplanes.
Based on the results presented in the paper the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. The implemented ﬁnite element with adoption of the HOM model as constitutive equation performs very well in the
numerical simulations of classical high order elasticity problems. This was veriﬁed by simulating bending of strain-
gradient elastic cantilever beams and computing the stress concentration due to a circular hole in a Cosserat elastic
plate subject to tension.
2. The HOM formulation with softening constitutive laws is only partially regularized and it shows mesh dependence in
the softening branch close to the peak load.
3. The regularization technique previously proposed bt Cusatis and Zhou [50] solves the mesh dependency in the initial
post peak but leads to stress locking and lack of clear convergence in the far post peak.
4. An optimal regularization of the post peak response is obtained by introducing the regularizing term on the high order
stress increments as opposed to the total high order stresses. With this approach a clear convergence can be observed
for both the load versus displacement curve and the strain proﬁle along the bar.

Appendix A: Voronoi Integration Scheme
For inelastic consitutive equations, Eq. 2 can only be computed numerically. In previous microplane model work [35, 36, 37]
gaussian optimal integration formulas were developed for the integration over the unit hemisphere. However, for the high
order microplane model adopted in this paper, integration over the entire unit sphere is required. Hence, a new integration
scheme was developed based on the voronoi tessellation of the unit sphere []. Fig. 6 show the discretization of a unit sphere
with 66 microplanes. The corresponding areas and spherical angles are reported in Table 3
The local system of refence, attached to each microplane, can be calculated as n1 = sin φ cos θ, n2 = sin φ sin θ, n3 = cos φ;
m1 = cos φ cos θ, m2 = cos φ sin θ, m3 = −sin φ ; and l1 = −sin θ, l2 = cos θ, l3 = 0.
For the discretized sphere the energetical equivalence, that relates microplane stresses, microplane couple stresses, and
microplane high order stresses to their macroscopic counterparts, can be written as
np
X
s=1
(σijδγij + µijδκij + ΣijkδΓijk)Vs =
np
X
s=1
R(σs
βδεs
β + µs
βδχs
β)As
(24)
where np is the number of microplanes, R = 1, As is the area of the generic microplane and Vs is the volume of a pyramid
of unit eight and base area equal to As. Since the macroscopic quantities are uniform inside the unit sphere and by using
18the kinematic contraint in Eq. 1, one obtains
σij = 3
np
X
s=1
wsσs
βP s

Σijk = 3ℓ0
np

(25)
where ws = As/ Pnp
s=1 As is the area ratio of fmicroplane s over the total area of all microplanes.
