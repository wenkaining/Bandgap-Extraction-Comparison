In the last few years there is an unprecedented progress in the increase of the power conversion
efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Evidently, further advances of the efficiency of these devices will
depend on the constraints imposed by the optical and electronic properties of their constituents.
Quite apparently that during the manufacturing process of a solar cell, there is an inevitable variation
in the thicknesses of various functional layers, which affects the optoelectronic characteristics of the
final sample. In this work a possible strategy of the analysis of the solar cell performance is suggested,
based on statistically averaging procedure of experimental data. We present a case study, in which
the optoelectronic properties of the meso-structured perovskite solar cell (with a mesoporous TiO2
layer) are analysed within the method providing a deeper understanding of the device operation.
This method enables an assessment of the overall quality of the device, pointing pathways towards
the maximum efficiency design of a perovskite solar cell by material properties tuning.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays organic-inorganic halide perovskites, as so-
lar cell light-absorbers, attract substantial attention. So-
lar cells with such photoactive layers are considered as
one of the most promising competitors to silicon-based
photovoltaics, reaching efficiencies of 25.8% only in two
decades of development [1]. Low-cost production of these
materials with high power conversion efficiency (PCE)
pledge fast development of flexible solar cells [2]. More-
over, there is challenging future in improvement of their
performance in order to reach their maximum efficiency
(cf.[3]) by means: engineering of perovskite composition
[4] or/and perovskite solar cell (PSC) constituents [5–9];
study and improvement of perovskite stability [10]; alter-
ing characteristics of optoelectronic behavior of PSC con-
stituents [11] by incorporation, for example, light trap-
ping mechanisms [12]; to name just a few.
Evidently, for further efficiency improvements of PSCs,
the analysis of optical and electric properties of different
layers in the device architecture is pivotal for optimizing
light-harvesting in the absorber, whilst allowing coherent
effects and parasitic absorption to be accounted in the
stack design. In addition, this analysis should be based
on statistically reliable estimates of noticeable dispersion
of various sample parameters during the manufacturing
process. Partially, some attempts in this direction have
been done in [13–15], where various type of simulations of
optoelectronic properties of PSCs have been conducted
recently. It is worth noting that for the analysis of opti-
cal properties various research groups (see, for example,
[16–20]) use the software SCAPS-1D [21] as a main tool.
This code does not, however, consider interference, scat-
tering, or intermediate reflectors (see details in [21]), thus
preventing the comprehensive analysis of the antireflec-
tion layer’s interference and the influence of thin films
thicknesses.
Also, a broad range of electron (hole) transport ma-
terials and back metal contacts have been considered to
examine the performance of lead-free PSCs in [22].
It
also became common to introduce a mesoporous TiO2
layer between TiO2 electron collecting contact and per-
ovskite (the main absorber layer). This process decreases
defect density at the absorber boundary, while may in-
troduce additional resistance. Nevertheless, the effect of
a mesoporous TiO2 layer and its influence on the PSC
performance remains in infancy. Here, we employ a ray
tracing-based optoelectronic computational model [23] to
reproduce the behaviour of a perovskite solar cell with
a mesoporous TiO2 layer and characterize experimen-

tal PSC samples. To this aim we further developed this
model, incorporating a few novel elements to treat prop-
erly thin-film meso-structured perovskite solar cells.
The experimental device configuration (see Fig.1) is se-
lected as the well established experimentally perovskite
solar cell [24].
The measurements of optical transmit-
tance have been performed in each stage of the man-
ufacturing process. In this n-i-p junction device struc-
ture, apart the complex glass substrate, a thin and com-
pact TiO2 (c-TiO2) is manufactured as an electron se-
lective contact to facilitate the collection of photogener-
ated electrons from perovskite absorber.
Next, to im-
prove the efficiency of carrier collection a mesoporous
TiO2 (mp-TiO2) is introduced to provide a suitable per-
ovskite deposition [25]. In addition, the partial infiltra-
tion of halide perovskite into the mp-TiO2 layer facili-
tates higher quantum yield for photo-excited charge sep-
aration. Spiro-OMeTAD has been utilized in establishing
a good p-contact between the gold (Au) counter electrode
with a perovskite absorber in our stack design. As men-
tioned above, we will elaborate the model [23] and dis-
cuss in detail the effective medium approach for analysis
of the optical behaviour of mp-TiO2. Our approach is
experimentally verified with measurements of the device
reflection and transmission spectra. These characteris-
tics have been measured by means of spectrophotometry
techniques applied at each manufacturing stage. Finally,
we make use of our approach to evaluate the dependence
of the PSC performance on the properties of the meso-
porous structure of the considered solar cell architecture,
based on statistically averaged physical and geometrical
parameters of the device.

METHODOLOGY
A.
Device Characteristics
Since electronic and optical measurements cannot be
performed on the same PSC sample, we use two batches
of 24 solar cells, manufactured at the same conditions.
One batch is used for optical measurements with inter-
ruptions on each phase of the process, while the second
one is used for J-V characteristic measurements without
any interruptions on each phase of the process.
Considering the deposition of a material as a new phase
of the process, we have performed the measurements of
optical transmittance of each PSC layer in each stage of
the manufacturing process (see details in Appendix A).
Stage 1 of the manufacturing process consists of the glass
substrate, assuming the material as a multilayer system
itself, formed by sodalime glass, SnO2, SiO2 and fluorine
doped tin oxide (FTO). In the stage 2 a layer of c-TiO2
of the order of tens of nanometers is added by the spray
pyrolysis technique. Next, a mp-TiO2 layer is deposited
in stage 3, followed by the subsequent deposition of a
perovskite (stage 4) and Spiro-OMeTAD (stage 5), the
latter three using the spin coating technique.
Next, using a solar simulator, the J-V characteristics of
the PSCs in operation a second batch of 24 solar cells has
been measured. The result of this measurements provides
the average value of the short-circuit current Jsc = 20.07
mA/cm2 with a standard deviation 0.99 mA/cm2 at ir-
radiance 1000 W/m2.
In this study we will focus on
reproducing the behaviour of the reverse scan of the J-
V characteristics. The scanning process conditions are
discussed in [24].
B.
Optoelectronic Model
To analyse the amount of transmitted, absorbed and
reflected light in each of the materials present in the
PSCs, we employ ray tracing simulations with the aid
of the ray trace OTSun python package [26].
It is
a Monte Carlo ray tracing where the optics is imple-
mented through the Fresnel optics equations in their
most general form, complemented by the transfer-matrix
method (TMM) to account for the interference phe-
nomenon [27, 28].
This software allows us to perform
the simulations by loading a geometry file designed with
the aid of FreeCAD [29], an open-source software for the
parametric modeling of geometric figures in 3D. The sim-
ulations require knowledge of the layer thicknesses as well
as the complex refractive indexes of the corresponding
materials as a function of wavelength (λ).
In particu-
lar, the complex refractive indexes of the following ma-
terials have been taken from literature: FTO [41], TiO2
[42], Spiro-OMeTAD [43]. In the case of SnO2 and SiO2
the data are taken from the material manufacturer itself.
According to the experimental setup [24] the chemical
structure of the perovskite layer has been associated with
FaPbI3. In this case the complex refractive index data
are taken from [34], where the real and imaginary parts
of the refractive index have been measured for a similar
perovskite. The physical characteristics of all layers that
form the architecture of our device are displayed in Table
I.
On the other hand, if the layer contains a few con-
stituents there is a need in some effective approach. The
refractive index of the glass has been calculated from
transmittance experimental measurements, while for the
mp-TiO2 material we have developed the effective ap-
proach to determine its complex refractive index (see be-
low).
Glass complex refractive index
Since the glass substrate consists of a few thin compo-
nents, to determine the glass optical properties itself the
oxides films have to be removed. To this aim, on the glass
multilayer system the etching process is done by using Zn
powder and HCl solution. As a result, the optical prop-
erties of the glass substrate has been determined with the
aid of the method [44], based on the ideas discussed be-3

a material is absorbing partially (k2 ≪n), the real part
n and the imaginary part k of the refractive index of the
slab can be calculated from the intensity of reflectance
R(λ) ≡R and transmittance T(λ) ≡T spectra (for the
sake of convenience we omit the symbol λ). In particular,

Mesoporous layer as an effective medium: an optical
approach
Mesoporous TiO2 is one of the commonly used elec-
tron transport materials (ETMs) in PSCs. The mp-TiO24

the wavelength are shown. Right panel: the real (n) and imaginary (k) components of the calculated complex

film serves not only as a scaffold for the perovskite layer
but also as a route for electron transport. However, in
many simulations (see, for example, [45–48]) the effect
of the porosity of the mesoporous TiO2 layer on opti-
cal and electronic properties meso-structured perovskite
solar cells is ignored.
The presence of mesoporous thin films requires a
proper approach to determine its optical characteriza-
tion. Several effective medium approximations have been
suggested to describe the optical properties of heteroge-
neous thin films by considering them as a homogeneous
media with an effective refractive index, along with effec-
tive absorption coefficient. Most of the models have been
developed for the effective refractive index omitting the
absorption coefficient (see for a review [49]). However,
the absorption can affect the optoelectronic properties
of ETM, and, consequently, the properties of the whole
system.
To consider the complex refractive index we apply the
Volume Average Theory (VAT) model, discussed among
others in [49]. It provides the effective complex refractive
index (subindex eff) of a material (see Eqs.(4)–(7)) com-
posed of a continuous phase material matrix (subindex
c) and a dispersed phase material matrix (subindex d),
with a porosity p:

The properties of the mp-TiO2 material can be charac-
terized using an effective medium that contains a mixture
of the c-TiO2 material and air, as suggested in [50–52].
In the latter paper, however, the effect of the extinction
coefficient k is missing. Evidently, it may play important
role, since the absorption in the mp-TiO2 layer depends
on the degree of its porosity. To find thickness configura-
tions that match best the experimental results we devel-
oped the special procedure to quantify the minimal devia-
tion of the theoretical estimations from the experimental
values for the transmittance and the short-circuit current
(see Figs.9, 10 and the accompanying text). Once the
above analysis has been completed, to gain much more
accurate results on the optical properties of the PSC we
use the OTSun python package.
Impact of porosity and Lambertian scattering
The knowledge of the thickness configuration enables
to us to simulate the photogeneration rate for its applica-
tion into the electronic transport equations. For the sake
of convenience we recapitulate briefly the basic steps of
this procedure (see details in [23]).
According to the Beer-Lambert law for a given absorp-
tion coefficient α(λ) = 4πk(λ)/λ of a material, the loss
of light intensity is a function of the path length ℓof the
light beam through a material:
N(ℓ, λ) = N0(0, λ)e−α(λ)ℓ.
(8)
Here, N0(0, λ) is the initial number of photons of the
incident ray on a material per unit area, per wavelength,
and per unit time (for each time when a ray impacts onto
a material according to the path trajectories determined
by the ray tracing simulation). With the aid of OTSun
and Eq.(8), we calculate the generation rate produced by
a single ray
G(z) =
Z ∞
0
α(λ)N0(0, λ)
cos θ
e−α(λ)z/ cos θdλ ,
(9)5
where z = ℓcos θ is the depth from a semiconductor sur-
face, and θ is the ray refracted angle. The function G(z)
provides the number of electrons per unit volume and
per unit time, generated at each point in the device due
to the photon absorption.
The total function G(z) is
the sum of all rays (transmitted or reflected) passed at
the point z. As a result, obtained PSC thickness con-
figuration and the rate function G(z) allow to calculate
the J-V characteristics by means of the transport model
[23]. In this model there is a set of parameters that are
relatively well established either from literature or from
measurements. Besides, there is another set that consists
of some uncertain parameters. All of them are listed in
Table I, where uncertain parameters are named as “vari-
able”. The latter ones are treated as fitting parameters
to explain the measured data.
There are a few comments in order, however. At this
stage we have to elaborate the model [23], taking into ac-
count the presence of the mp-TiO2 layer. Consequently,
to carry out the calculations within the transport model
we have to define the permittivity and the conductivity
of the mp-TiO2 layer σmp = qµmpNmp; here µmp is a
majority carriers mobility, and Nmp is the doping con-
centration.
From the optical properties of different layers, we ob-
tain the fact that the mp-TiO2 layer includes air-filled
holes (porosity). As the concentration of these holes is
small (∼20%), we apply the electrodynamic approach
developed for weakly mixed systems (see the textbook
[53]). In this case the permittivity of the mp-TiO2 mate-
rial is provided by the expression for permittivity of the
mixture εmix:
εmix = εT iO2 + c3(εa −εT iO2)εT iO2
εa + 2εT iO2
,
(10)
where εT iO2 and εa are the permittivities of TiO2 and air,
respectively; c is the concentration of holes. As for the
conductivity, we make use of the fact obtained from the
optical properties fitting. Due to small concentration of
air-filled holes in the mp-TiO2 layer one can suppose that
the conductivity in this layer should be reduced on 20%
as well. As a result, it seems reasonable to assume that
for the donor concentration holds the relation Nmp =
0.8 · Nc, while the mobility of the carriers remains the
same µmp = µc, as in the c-TiO2 layer (see Sec.III) To
obtain the better agreement with the J-V characteristics
of our experimental device, we propose to vary only the
unknown parameters Nmp, the mobility of carriers µ and
their relaxation time τ in the perovskite layer, keeping
the other parameters fixed.
It is important to stress that OTSun provides a more
accurate form of the photogeneration rate G(z) compare
to the TMM approach used in Appendix A, since non-
specular reflection and multiple reflection are considered.
In particular, from images obtained with the aid of the
scanning electron microscope (see Fig.8) it can be seen
that the gold layer (the top layer) has nano-sized rough-
ness, of the order of magnitude of its thickness (∼80
nm). With a high degree of certainty, it can be argued
that these textures provide a Lambertian reflection to the
surface.
Such textures randomly reflect the light that
impacts on the gold layer, and, consequently, increase
the optical path in the perovskite, and the photocurrent
(cf.[11]). As a result, taking into account all facts above,
we obtain by means of Eq.(9) that Jsc = 20.15 mA/cm2
(see Fig.10), i.e., it is slightly higher than the TMM result
and closer to the experimental value.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Begin with, we recall the main result on the analy-
sis of the layer thicknesses (see details in Appendix A).
The layer configuration chosen as the theoretical model
of the PSCs studied is (in nm): 11 (SiO2), 16 (SnO2), 565
(FTO), 24 (c-TiO2), 240 (mp-TiO2, porosity = 20%), 500
(Perovskite), 250 (Spiro-OMeTAD). The result of this
final disposition that produces the best consistency be-
tween theoretical and experimental values for the short-
circuit current and the optical transmittance in each
stage of the manufacturing process is displayed in Fig.3.
There is a rather well agreement between experimen-
tal and theoretical results, except two cases: stage 3 and
stage 4. The visible difference between the experimen-
tal and theoretical curves is located in the wavelength
region 380 −500 nm. This result implies some inaccu-
racy in estimation of the mp-TiO2 layer absorption coef-
ficient. Theoretical result exhibits the larger absorption
for the perovskite FAPbI3 (stage 4) in comparison with
that of the experimental sample in the wavelength range
770 −800 nm. This disagreement is due to the difference
between the experimental value of the perovskite absorp-
tion coefficient and that adopted from [34]. Since this
difference is located at a small interval 760 < λ < 800
nm of the right boundary of the considered wavelength
region, it may be safely ignored in the description of the
J-V characteristics discussed below.6
The values of theoretical layer thicknesses and material
parameters (see Table I) are used as the input parame-
ters in the electronic transport model to fit the simulated
and measured J-V characteristics of the PSC. The fitting
procedure is described in [23] but here we mention some
peculiarities:
1 The main source of difference between the simu-
lated and the measured short-circuit current has
been related in [23] to the reflection properties of
the PSC layers.
In present paper the reflection
properties are already taken into account by our
optical model. It results in the remarkable accord
between theoretical and experimental values of the
short-circuit current (see below).
FIG. 4: RMSE as a function of carrier mobility in
perovskite for different doping concentration in the
mp-TiO2 layer. The solid curves are associated with the
results of calculations without any additional
resistances. The dotted line is associated with the
results obtained by means of the additional resistances
(see details in the text).
2 To fit the simulated and “measured averaged” open
circuit voltage (Voc) one needs to vary the carrier
lifetimes (τ) in the perovskite [23]. Once we vary
the donor concentration Nmp and the mobility µ,
it is required to fit a τ-value to reproduce the ex-
perimental value of Voc. To control the accuracy
of the fitting procedure of J-V characteristics, we
introduce the root mean square error
RMSE = 1
N
sX
i
[Jexp
sc (Vi) −Jth
sc (Vi)]2 ,
(11)
where the number of steps N is defined by the
voltage range interval V = 0 −Voc passed with a
step size ∆V .
At each new value of the voltage
Vi = i·∆V , we solve the system of nonlinear trans-
port equations (see Sec.2.4 in [23]) to calculate the
current and compare its value with the experimen-
tal data. The results of calculations manifest the
dependence of the RMSE on values of Nmp and the
mobility µ (see Fig.4).
3 We recall that the analysis of the transmittance re-
sulted in a degree of porosity of the order of 20%
for the mp-TiO2 layer. Evidently, the presence of
the porosity in the mp-TiO2 layer should affect the
donor concentration in this material in compari-
son to that in the c-TiO2 layer, which is 1 · 1018
cm−3 (see Table I). Consequently, it is natural to
suppose that the donor concentration in the mp-
TiO2 layer will decrease to the value 8 · 1017 cm−3,
proportionally to the degree of its porosity. Taking
into account that the porosity affects the permittiv-
ity (see Eq.10) and the donor concentration of the
mp-TiO2 layer, we solve the transport equations
and reach the RMSE minimum (0.18 mA/cm2) at
µ = 5 cm2/(V·s) (see Fig.4; triangles connected by
solid yellow line). There is a visible difference be-
tween the simulated and the “measured averaged”
J-V characteristics (see Fig.5(a)).
A fairly common trick in the calculation of J-V
characteristics is to use the analogy of the PSC to
a current generator in parallel with a diode (see,
for example, the analysis in [11]).
Hereafter we
follow this procedure, since such an approach en-
ables to us to consider the parasitic resistance of
the contacts and feeding conductors, R; the leakage
resistance, related to the local short-circuit of elec-
tron/hole transport material layers, Rsh (see the
insert in Fig.5(a)).
Once all necessary additional resistances are gener-
ated, we obtain a good agreement of our results
with the experimental J-V characteristics.
This
agreement (see Fig.5(a)) is reached with the aid
of the following values of the variable parame-
ters: µ=15 cm2/(V·s) (see Fig.4); R=4 Ohm·cm2;
Rsh →∞; τ = 2.47 ns that yields the diffusion
length ℓD =
p
µkBTτ/|e| = 0.3 µm.
It turns out, however, that we can obtain even bet-
ter agreement varying the donor concentration in
the mp-TiO2 layer.
The variation of the RMSE
between simulated and “measured averaged” J-
V characteristics yields the RMSE absolute mini-
mum (see Fig.4) at the “optimal” mobility µ=50
cm2/(V·s), and the donor concentration Nmp =
1 · 1017 cm−3. The optimal carrier lifetimes τ=0.7
ns yields again the diffusion length ℓD = 0.3 µm.
At these parameters we obtain a remarkable agree-
ment between the simulated and the “measured av-
eraged” J-V characteristics, without any additional
resistances (see Fig.5(b)). It seems that in the mp-
TiO2 layer pore holes generate all necessary addi-
tional resistance in the measured device.
Conse-
quently, it appears that in the real device the pore
dimension occupying 20% of the mp-TiO2 layer is
sufficient to affect optical properties of the PSC. It
turns out, however, that only small part of the re-
maining TiO2 take part in the conductance due to
large amount of defects on the pore boundaries.7
FIG. 5: J-V characteristics. In panels (a) and (b) solid line connecting solid circles is associated with the “measured
averaged” values. The panel (a): dashed (dot-dashed) line connecting solid triangles (squares) is associated with the
results obtained without (with) additional resistances at 20% porosity of mp-TiO2 layer. The panel (b): dashed line
connecting solid triangles is associated with the results obtained without additional resistances (see for details the
text). Light blue band around all these curves marks the range in which the measured J-V characteristics of
different samples lie. The insert in the panel (a) displays the circuit layout of the generator.
It is noteworthy, the parameters values obtained by
means of our fitting procedure are located within the
parameter range considered in literature. In particular,
several studies suggest that the doping values of the mp-
TiO2 material are in the range of 1016 to 1019 (cm−3)
[54]. Moreover, the carrier mobility range measured for
perovskite is in the range from 5 to 50 (cm2/(V·s))[55].
The degree of the accuracy of our analysis is summarized
in Tables II,III. It demonstrates that the short-circuit
current, the open circuit voltage, the fill factor and the
power conversion efficiency for both simulated and ex-
perimental PSC are in a remarkable agreement.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary we have successfully utilized the optoelec-
tronic model based on experimentally obtained optical
features for planar meso-structured perovskite solar cells.
Our optoelectronic model incorporates ray tracing simu-
lations, the transfer-matrix method and the carrier trans-
port equations. The ray tracing allows the exploration of
any geometry, since the solar collector device is designed
by means of the FreeCAD software.
The combination
of the ray tracing with the transfer-matrix method al-
lows to perform the optical simulations considering Fres-
nel optics, internal reflections of the multilayer system,
scattering produced by nanoroughness layers, and effec-
tive layers with some peculiarities (such as porous mate-
rials).
Large number of transmittance-reflectance measure-
ments on the several stages of manufacturing process
have been used to fix the uncertainties of the PSC lay-
ers thicknesses and the mesoporous TiO2 layer poros-
ity. The same number of measurements have been done
to define the average J-V characteristics of experimental
devices. The obtained results within the optoelectronic
model have been further used to analyse J-V characteris-8
tics of the manufactured PSCs by means of the optimiza-
tion procedure based on the multiple-use of the solution
transport equations [23]. The developed model demon-
strates good agreement with both optical and electrical
measurements leading to extraction of the layers thick-
nesses, the porosity degree and the permittivity of the
mesoporous TiO2 material, the perovskite carriers mo-
bility and lifetimes. In addition, we have found that even
small degree of the porosity can affect the performance
of the experimental devices, reducing essentially the ef-
fective donor concentration (i.e., the conductance) of the
mp-TiO2 layer in comparison to that in the c-TiO2 layer.
Our approach allows the study of devices with differ-
ent architectures. Reversing the order of the materials in
the solar cell structure does not affect the development of
the optoelectronic simulations. Thus our work provides a
useful platform for device optimization towards increas-
ing PCE as well as appropriate tools for the analysis of
various optoelectronic properties of meso-structured per-
ovskite solar cells.

Device Characteristics
The device fabrication and the experimental work, pre-
sented in this paper, have been carried out at the facil-
ities of the Institut Catal`a de Nanoci`encia i Nanotec-
nologia (ICN2) in collaboration with the Nanomateri-
als for Photovoltaics Energy research group. The per-
ovskite solar cells have been fabricated with the FTO/c-
TiO2/mp-TiO2/Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au configu-
ration using multi-cationic perovskite. Each of these ma-
terials has its own synthesis and deposition process; all
fabrication details are discussed in [24]. Example of final
samples is shown in Fig.6.

The incident radiation consists of 200 −800 nm
wavelength range of the optical spectrum. The results
of the mean value of the optical transmittance measure-
ments for each stage as a function of the wavelength are
shown in Fig.7. Our measurements make manifest that
it is enough to fabricate six samples at each stage to ob-
tain a reliable result for the mean value. Additionaly,
we indicate the standard deviation from the mean value
for each curve, corresponding to each stage. The largest
deviations are obtained for the c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 de-
positions (stages 2 and 3, respectively). Noteworthy, up
to now there is no any available criterium in literature
regarding definition of the effective border line between
c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 depositions.
In fact, one of our
goals is to propose such the effective methodology.

visible the degree of the gold layer roughness. The
extracted approximate thickness of each layer is
presented in Table IV.
Layer Thicknesses
The approximate thickness of each material layers
has been estimated using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) techniques (see Fig.8). These images are essential
for modelling the PSC, since each layer thickness asses-
ment is a key parameter in the following model calcula-
tions. The heterogeneity observed in the layer thicknesses
is due to the experimental process itself, subject to vari-
ations in the initial conditions, the experience and skill
of the technician, the correct stoichiometric balance of
the compounds, etc. The less accuracy for the estima-
tion of the c-TiO2 layer thickness is due to its extension
diapason in the range of a few tens of nanometers.

TABLE IV: Thickness range of the material layers
present in the PSC samples measured by scanning
electron microscopy.
Note that the substrate is formed by four different ma-
terials.
The thickness of each component in the com-
pound is provided by the manufacturer itself: 2.2 mm
of glass, 25 nm of SnO2 and SiO2, and 540 nm of FTO.
Even so, in the images (see Fig.8) it can be seen that the
FTO is not completely homogeneous. Consequently, we
consider a certain range of thicknesses, in which the cal-
culations for the characterization are carried out. From
the images obtained by SEM, the thickness ranges con-
sidered for the materials in the successive calculations,
are shown in Table IV.
Detailed elaboration of thickness configuration
In order to fit theoretical and experimental transmit-
tances, a concrete thickness configuration of the PSC
structure is needed. Since scanning electronic microscope
images show that the thicknesses of the layers is not com-
pletely homogeneous, we must consider a range between
which each layer thickness lies.
Before to resolve this
problem we have to analyse the optical properties of each
layer.
One of the most common theoretical tools used to
analyse the optical properties of complex solar systems
with a high accuracy is the so called Monte-Carlo ray
tracing simulation.
It consists of a set of techniques
that determine the path of light through matter in a
three-dimensional environment with computer simula-
tions [56]. We implement in our approach the Monte-
Carlo ray tracing technique, adding the transfer-matrix
method (TMM) to characterize the optical response of
the PSC with the aid of the ray trace OTSun python
package [57–59]. In order to carry out simulations in a
simpler and faster way, first, we use the TMM only to
determine the thicknesses configuration. Based on the
results discussed hereafter, the OTSun will be used (see
the main text) as the subsequent step where more ac-
curate calculations are needed. Consequently, using the
ranges shown in Table IV, each possible configuration is10
considered to provide the transmittance with the aid of
the TMM calculation, to obtain those that are closer to
the experimental curves. To reach our goal we introduce
the root mean square error (RMSE) of each thickness
configuration for a given material thickness
RMSE = 1

(A1)
Here, N is the total number of wavelength steps; the step
is equal to 1 nm in all cases; T exp(T th) is the experimen-
tal (theoretical) optical transmittance. Hereafter, it is
convenient to introduce the range limits of the thickness
variation for each layer as [a,b] (in nm).
First, we carry out the calculations for the stage 1. To
this aim we consider the following thicknesses: [10,30]
for SnO2 and SiO2; [500, 600] for FTO. As a result, we
choose those configurations that lie within 1% of the low-
est RMSE.
Next, we proceed to the stage 2 (repeating similar cal-
culations), using the range limits obtained from the stage
1: [10,20] for SnO2 and SiO2; [550,600] for FTO; [10,30]
for c-TiO2. These calculations reduce the starting range
limits to [10,16], [14,20], [550,600], [22,30] for SnO2, SiO2,
FTO, c-TiO2, respectively.
Afterwards, we move to the stage 3, where both the
thickness and the porosity of the mp-TiO2 are added to
the system.
An initial sweep is made considering the
previous ranges plus the mp-TiO2 [180,300] layer and
its porosity considered between 1% and 50%.
Consid-
ering the configurations that lie within 1% of the lowest
RMSE, the material thicknesses are varied in the follow-
ing intervals: [10,12] for SnO2; [14,18] for SiO2; [555,580]
for FTO; [23,25] for c-TiO2; [200,300] for mp-TiO2, and
its porosity reduced to the 10%–20% range.
From our previous experience (see details in [11, 23]) it
follows that small changes in layer thicknesses (in order
of a few nanometers) at the stage 2 do not affect the
optical transmittance of the device. Therefore, we choose
the mean values 11, 16, 565, and 24 nm (associated with
SnO2, SiO2, FTO, c-TiO2 layer thickness, respectively),
which are defined within the ranges imposed by the stage
3. By fixing these values, we also reduce significantly the
calculation time, enabling us to explore the mesoporous
material and its subsequent influence on the properties
of the absorbing layer.
We recall that the stage 4 includes the perovskite layer
considered in the [400,550] interval, while keeping the
variability of the porosity and thickness of the mp-TiO2
layer as mentioned above. Since there is a complex inter-
play of the transmittance through the mp-TiO2 layer and
its effect on the transmittance through the perovskite, we
consider the ranges of three parameters simultaneously:
i) the mp-TiO2 layer thickness; ii) its porosity; iii) the
perovskite thickness within 5% of the lowest RMSE se-
lection. As a result, we obtain that: the mp-TiO2 poros-
ity oscillates between 10% and 20%, while its thickness
between 260 and 300 nm; the perovskite layer thick-
ness oscillates between 450 and 500 nm.
In the stage
5 the Spiro-OMeTAD layer is added with a thickness
defined in [200,250] nm interval. Our calculations yield
that the configurations within 5% of the lowest RMSE
lie in the following interval (in nm): [270,300] for the
mp-TiO2 layer; the porosity is defined between 15% and
20%; [450,470] for the perovskite layer; [200, 250] for the
Spiro-OMeTAD layer.
Notice that the configurations that fit better the opti-
cal behaviour of the experimental samples are not nec-
essarily those that fit better the electronic properties of
the experimental samples. Consequently, our analysis is
supplemented by one more parameter: the short-circuit
current Jsc. Therefore, considering the ranges of param-
eters for each material obtained under the previous pro-
cedure and making them less restrictive, we proceed to
the calculations of the short-circuit current Jsc, which
will involve adding the gold metal layer to the system.
Again, we have to vary the discussed parameters within
the above limits (see below). Taking this fact into ac-
count, the maximum possible photocurrent is calculated
in the assumption that all absorbed photons generate
electron and holes and contribute to the current [40].
In an efficient PSC this current is closely related to the
short-circuit current, Jsc. As a result, to reach a consis-
tently between optical and electronic properties we cal-
culate the short-circuit current for every configuration,
taking into account that the mean value of the measured
current Jsc = 20.07 mA/cm2 (see details in the main
text).
We recall that all the effects regarding the radiation-
matter interaction mentioned above, are needed to eluci-
date the number of absorbed photons inside active ma-
terials. To this aim the photogeneration rate G of the
creation of pairs of electrons/holes should be considered
a position-dependent function within the material thick-
ness. To this aim we employ the method proposed by
Ball et al. [60] and the TMM library [27] to calculate the
short-circuit current Jsc as:
Jsc = q
Z
G(λ, z)dλdz ,
(A2)
where q is the electron charge, and z is the depth from
the semiconductor surface.
Turning to the calculation
details of the discussed procedure, first, we fix the mul-
tilayer glass thicknesses at 11, 16, 565 (nm) for SnO2,
SiO2, FTO, respectively; and 24 nm for c-TiO2. Second,
it is observed that the photocurrent is very sensitive to
the thickness and porosity of the mp-TiO2 layer. Indeed,
it should be noted that at stages 2 and 3 that correspond
to the deposition of the c-TiO2 and the mp-TiO2 layers,
respectively, a standard deviation 10 times higher rela-
tive to those for other stages (see Fig.7). Including the
Jsc calculations to the RMSE result obtained from the
transmittance fitting, we weakend the boundaries found
above, in particularly, for the porosity and for the mp-
TiO2 layer thickness. Consequently, we vary the porosity11
FIG. 9: The short-circuit current Jsc as a function of mp-TiO2 porosity (a), mp-TiO2 thickness (b), perovskite
thickness (c) and Spiro-OMeTAD thickness (d).
FIG. 10: The short-circuit Jsc as a function of the
RMSE, calculated by fitting the experimental and
theoretical transmittance of stage 5. The optimal
configurations (red solid points) are located in the range
of ±5% deviation from the experimental value of the
short-circuit current. Black point corresponds to the
selected case, used for comparison of experimental and
theoretical J-V characteristics (see main text).
and thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer (from 2% to 20%,
from 200 to 300 nm, respectively); the perovskite thick-
ness (from 450 to 550 nm); the Spiro-OMeTAD thickness
(from 200 to 250 nm). As a result, we do calculations by
varying the following parameters:
1 porosity takes 10 possible values;
2 mp-TiO2 thickness takes 11 possible values;
3 perovskite thickness takes 11 possible values;
4 Spiro-OMeTAD thickness takes 6 possible values,
i.e. we have a set of 10×11×11×6 = 7260 combinations
determined by the parameters variations. Altogether the
chosen parameters provide the basis for the calculation
of the set Jsc values (see Fig.9).
Among all the possible configurations, we have selected
those that hold the following criteria: i) be ≤|5|% with
respect to the experimental value of the short-circuit cur-
rent Jsc; ii) be ≤5% of the lowest RMSE (red region
in Fig.10). From this selection, the configuration with
the highest Jsc has been chosen denoted by the black
point on Fig.10. The results for the short-circuit current
Jsc demonstrate: i) its less sensitivity to the variation of
the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD thicknesses; ii) while
the close correspondence to the experimental value of the
short-circuit current Jsc takes place at the thickness 240
nm and the porosity value = 20% of the mp-TiO2 layer.
Summarising, according to our analysis the theoretical
configuration, chosen to model the experimental samples,
consists of the following layer thicknesses (in nm): 11
(SiO2), 16 (SnO2), 565 (FTO), 24 (c-TiO2), 240 (mp-
TiO2, the porosity = 20%), 500 (Perovskite), 250 (Spiro-
OMeTAD). This configuration is obtained as a result of
optimization of the optical transmittance of the device
configuration at the value of the short-circuit current
Jsc = 19.83 mA/cm2.
