Abstract
In the ground state of Ho2Ti2O7 spin ice, the disorder of the mag-
netic moments follows the same rules as the proton disorder in water
ice. Excitations take the form of magnetic monopoles that interact
via a magnetic Coulomb interaction.
Muon spin rotation has been
used to probe the low-temperature magnetic behaviour in single crys-
tal Ho2−xYxTi2O7 (x = 0, 0.1, 1, 1.6 and 2). At very low temper-
atures, a linear ﬁeld dependence for the relaxation rate of the muon
precession λ(B), that in some previous experiments on Dy2Ti2O7 spin
ice has been associated with monopole currents, is observed in samples
with x = 0, and 0.1. A signal from the magnetic ﬁelds penetrating
into the silver sample plate due to the magnetization of the crystals
is observed for all the samples containing Ho allowing us to study the
unusual magnetic dynamics of Y doped spin ice.
1In the spin ice materials R2Ti2O7 (R = Ho, Dy) [1, 2, 3] a large (∼10µB)
magnetic moment on the R3+ ions giving a strong, but at low temperature
almost completely screened dipole-dipole interaction, together with a lo-
cal Ising-like anisotropy leads to an eﬀective nearest-neighbour frustrated
ferromagnetic interaction between the magnetic moments. The organizing
principles of the magnetic ground-state in spin ice, or “ice rules”, require
that two R3+ spins should point in and two out of each elementary tetra-
hedron in the R2Ti2O7 pyrochlore lattice [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Excitations above
the ground state manifold, which locally violate the ice rules, can be viewed
as magnetic monopoles of opposite “magnetic charge” connected by Dirac
strings [8, 9, 10]. Evidence of magnetic monopoles in spin ice has recently
been observed in several experiments [11, 12, 13].
Given the existence of magnetic monopoles, it is logical to consider
the nature of the magnetic charges and any associated currents or “mag-
netricity”. Bramwell et al. used transverse-ﬁeld muon spin-rotation (TF-
µSR) to investigate the magnitude and dynamics of the magnetic charge in
Dy2Ti2O7 spin ice [14]. In these experiments the equivalence of electricity
and magnetism proposed in Ref. [8] was assumed and Onsager’s theory [15],
which describes the nonlinear increase with applied ﬁeld in the dissocia-
tion constant of a weak electrolyte (second Wien eﬀect), was applied to
the problem of spin ice.
It was argued that in spin ice, if the magnetic
ﬁeld B is changed, the relaxation of the magnetic moment νµ occurs at the
same rate as that of the monopole density and so in the weak ﬁeld limit,
νµ(B)/νµ(0) = κ(B)/κ(0) = 1 + b/2, where κ is the magnetic conductivity
and b = µ0Q3B/8πk2
BT 2 with a magnetic charge Q [14]. At low tempera-
ture, the ﬂuctuating local ﬁelds lead to a de-phasing of the muon precession
and an exponential decay in the oscillatory muon polarization as a function
of time t
A(t) = A0 cos(2πυt) exp(−λt),
(1)
where A0 is the initial muon asymmetry, υ = γµB/2π is the frequency of
the oscillations, and γµ is the gyromagnetic ratio.
With νµ(B)/νµ(0) =
λ(B)/λ(0) one can directly infer the magnetic monopole charge.
These
measurements have proven intriguing and controversial.
Dunsiger et al.
[16] contend that the TF-µSR data never takes a form where λ ∝ν (see
however [17]). It has also been suggested that the magnetic ﬁeld at any
muon implantation site in Dy2Ti2O7 is likely to take a range of values up to
0.5 T [16, 18, 19]. If this is the case it is diﬃcult to understand how the ﬁelds
of 1-2 mT used in Ref. [14] could lead to a precession signal. Both Dunsiger
et al. [16] and later Blundell [19] have suggested that the signals seen in the
2µSR data in Ref. [14] originate from outside the sample. In their reply to
this suggestion, Bramwell et al. [22] acknowledged that their experiments
exploited both muons implanted in the sample (interior muons) and muons
decaying outside the sample (exterior muons), with the aim of separating
near and far ﬁeld contributions to the signal. They went on to note that
the signal at higher temperatures is dominated by muons implanted in the
silver backing plate.
This possibility was not discussed in their original
paper [14].
Nevertheless, they continued to insist that the signal at low
temperature (0.4 > T > 0.07 K) cannot be explained by exterior muons
and that the Wien eﬀect signal originates from muons within the sample
or muons suﬃciently close to the surface of the sample so as to probe the
monopolar far ﬁeld.
Results
Fig. 1 shows a TF-µSR time spectrum collected at 150 mK in a ﬁeld of
2 mT for a pure Ho2Ti2O7 sample. This curve is representative of the data
collected during this study. A rapid loss in asymmetry from an initial value
of ∼0.22 occurs outside the time window of the MuSR spectrometer [14,
18, 19]. The slowly relaxing component of the data were ﬁt using Eq. 2.
Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate
λ(T) for Ho2−xYxTi2O7 extracted from ﬁts to µSR time data collected in
2 mT, (see methods and [20]). For all the samples containing Ho, a nearly
T independent λ(T) is observed at low-temperature. As the temperature
is raised there is a rapid increase in λ(T) at some crossover temperature
TCR. This TCR increases from ∼0.4 K for the crystals with x = 1.6 and
1.0 (data not shown) to 0.5 K for the samples with x = 0.1 and 0.0. Above
TCR the relaxation rate decreases with increasing temperature and has a
similar T dependence for all four samples containing Ho that were studied.
For two samples (x = 0.1 and 1.6) we also collected ﬁeld-cooled-cooling
data.
In both cases a divergence between the zero-ﬁeld-cooled warming
(ZFCW) and the ﬁeld-cooled cooling (FCC) curves appears at TCR. For
pure Y2Ti2O7 a temperature independent relaxation rate is measured for
the whole temperature range (0.05 to 5 K) studied.
In order to better understand the origins of these signals we have also
collected relaxation data as a function of temperature in 2 mT for the
pure Ho2Ti2O7 sample discussed above, covered with a silver foil 0.25 mm
thick. This thickness of foil is expected to stop all the muons before they
reach the sample. Muons implanted in silver have a negligible relaxation

and so any relaxation must result from a combination of the externally ap-
plied ﬁeld and/or ﬁeld lines originating from the sample penetrating into
the silver. The λ(T) curve obtained in this way (see [20]) is very similar to
the signal from the pure Ho2Ti2O7 shown in Fig. 2a and demonstrates that
at least some of the signal come from ﬁelds within the silver, but that these
ﬁelds are the result of the magnetic properties of the sample [20].
As a next step we then investigated the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of
muon relaxation rate. Fig. 3 shows λ(B) for a sample with x = 0 at selected
temperatures. Studies were also made for samples with x = 0.1, 1, 1.6 and
2. Following Bramwell et al., linear ﬁts to the λ(B) data were made at each
temperature. Using the gradient and intercept extracted from each ﬁt, the
eﬀective magnetic charge Qeﬀwas obtained from Qeﬀ= 2.1223m1/3T 2/3,
where m = (dλ(B)/dB)/λ0 [14].
For samples with x = 0 and 0.1 the
resulting values of Qeﬀrange from 4.5 to 7.5 µB˚A−1 in the temperature
regime in which Onsager’s theory is expected to be valid, but increase rapidly
as the temperatures increase outside this range (see Fig. 4).
At high temperature, a linear ﬁeld dependence for λ(B) is also observed
for the two samples with a much higher yttrium doping (x = 1 and 1.6) but
the calculated Qeﬀis always greater that ∼10 µB˚A−1. For x = 1 and 1.6

in the low-temperature regime T < TCR there is no systematic linear ﬁeld
dependence in λ(B) and no signal that can be associated with magnetricity.
We have also looked for a linear magnetic ﬁeld dependence in λ(B) for
the pure Ho2Ti2O7 sample covered in a thick (0.25 mm) silver foil. At higher
temperatures T > TCR we observed a linear behaviour leading to a large
Qeﬀ(i.e. Qeﬀ> 10 µB˚A−1), but at low temperatures T < TCR we found
no signature of magnetricity and could not obtain reliable linear ﬁts to the
λ(B) data or physically acceptable values for Qeﬀ.
Discussion
We can draw a number of important conclusions from our work. Our results
indicate that at higher temperatures, as suggested previously [16, 19, 22],
the dominant contribution to the λ(T) signal arises from stray ﬁelds from
the magnetized spin ice that penetrate into the silver sample plate. The
observation of a signal in a sample covered with thick Ag foil adds weight
to this hypothesis. The sample coverage of the Ag backing plates used in

our experiments was always approximately 50%. It will be interesting to
explore how this signal changes as this coverage is varied. It may also be
important to consider the ratio between the surface area and the volume
of the spin ice in these and other experiments.
Diﬀerences between the
bulk and surface conductivity of water ice are well documented [21] and it is
likely that analogous processes operate in spin ice. In reply to the comments
on their work, however, Bramwell et al. [22] make the point that a signal
from muons implanted in the sample plate may not negate the important
ﬁndings of their study. Our data are consistent with the suggestion made
in Ref. [22] that the Wien eﬀect signal may arise from inside the sample
or from within the Ag sample plate but at distances very close to the spin
ice sample surface. We will return to this point later. First we note that
the λ(T) curve for pure Ho2Ti2O7 follows closely the form expected for the
magnetization of pure spin ice [23] supporting the view that λ(T) reﬂects
the magnetization in all the samples studied. This then raises an interesting
question concerning the low-temperature magnetic dynamics of spin ice.
Recently there have been a number of experimental reports on the mag-
netic dynamics of spin ice (see for example [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]). In addition
to the discussion of magnetic monopoles and the Wien eﬀect [8, 9, 10, 14]
authors have also considered the eﬀects of thermal quenching [29]. A key
component of the current theories of spin ice, is that the magnetic response

at low temperatures and small applied ﬁelds is limited to monopole mo-
tion. So as the monopole density decreases the characteristic time scales
become longer. This view has recently been called into question following
new low-temperature AC susceptibility measurements that exhibit an acti-
vated behaviour with energy barriers that are inconsistent with the present
understanding of monopoles in spin ice [26, 30, 31].
Our results for the
x = 1.6 material, showing the survival of ZFCW-FCC splitting in a sam-
ple with only 15% Ho add a further twist to this puzzle. Given the large
number of non-magnetic “defects” on the corners of many of the tetrahedra
in this diluted material, it is not easy to attribute the slow relaxation to a
low monopole density. At such low concentrations of magnetic ions even the
concepts of a spin ice and monopoles are questionable.
It is conceivable that single ion physics plays a more important role in the
behaviour of the diluted materials. Our diﬀuse neutron-scattering studies of
single-crystal Ho2−xYxTi2O7 showed that at low temperature the scattering
patterns are characteristic of a dipolar spin ice and appear to be unaﬀected
7by Y doping up to at least x = 1.0 [32]. One possible scenario is that eﬀects,
such as distortions in the local environment due to the variation in the size
of the Ho3+/Y3+ ions [33], produce energy barriers at low-T that exceed
the cost of an isolated monopole. The slow dynamics and the ZFCW-FCC
hysteresis at low temperatures would thus cross over from a regime where
this behaviour is attributed to low monopole density to a regime where it is
due to exceedingly slow single ion physics. Alternatively, the long-range na-
ture of the dipolar interactions may give rise to collective eﬀects beyond the
monopole description which introduce new energy barriers to spin ﬂipping
at very low temperatures that occur in both undiluted and diluted systems.
The same qualitative form for the λ(T) data for samples with x = 0.1 and
1.6 indicate that additional ingredients may be required to explain the low
T behaviour in spin ice and that further studies on diluted samples are
needed to fully understand the role played by factors such as impurities,
dislocations, and surface eﬀects on the low-temperature dynamics of spin
ice.
Returning to the question of magnetricity in spin ice we note that in our
µSR data the low-temperature signal that has previously been interpreted
as a signature of magnetricity is seen in the x = 0 and 0.1 samples and is
not observed in the more dilute Ho2−xYxTi2O7 materials. Within the T
range indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4, where the theory presented
by Bramwell et al. is expected to be valid, the value of Qeﬀagrees with
expectations.
Following Blundell [19] we also plot m versus T.
We see
that the expected m ∝T −2 only holds for the same narrow T range. Our
experiments, including two separate runs on pure Ho2Ti2O7 carried out three
months apart, demonstrate the reproducibility of the data (see Fig. 2a). A
realignment of the Ho2Ti2O7 disks between runs also shows that the results
are not particularly sensitive to the exact details of the sample geometry.
Our results for the samples with a higher Y content and with the thick Ag
foil demonstrate that the behaviour cannot be attributed to instrumental
eﬀects. The samples were made at Warwick [34] and are Ho rather than Dy
based pyrochlores, eliminating the possibility of material speciﬁc results.
In summary transverse-ﬁeld µSR experiments on Ho2−xYxTi2O7, includ-
ing measurements on non-magnetic Y2Ti2O7 and a sample of Ho2Ti2O7 cov-
ered in thick silver foil, suggest that the majority signal in the λ(T) response
comes from stray ﬁelds due the sample magnetization penetrating into the
silver sample plate [16, 19]. The results for Ho2Ti2O7 are comparable with
those observed for Dy2Ti2O7. The low-temperature (T < TCR) linear ﬁeld
dependence in λ(B) is only observed in samples with x = 0 and 0.1. In this
low-temperature regime the value of Qeﬀagrees quantitatively with the the-
8ory presented in Ref. [14]. The low-temperature hysteresis in λ(T) for the
magnetically dilute material (x = 1.6) appears inconsistent with the current
understanding of monopoles in spin ice.
Methods
Single crystals of Ho2−xYxTi2O7 (x = 0, 0.1, 1, 1.6 and 2) were grown in
an image furnace using the ﬂoating zone technique [34]. The single crystal
disks were glued on to a silver plate and covered with a thin (0.01 mm) sheet
of silver foil to improve thermal conductivity. The plate was then attached
to the cold stage of an Oxford Instruments 3He/4He dilution refrigerator.
Transverse-ﬁeld muon spin-rotation experiments were performed using the
MuSR spectrometer at the ISIS pulsed muon facility, Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, UK. The magnetic ﬁeld was applied along the [001] direction,
perpendicular to the initial direction of the muon spin polarization which
was along a [110] axis.
Measurements were carried out as a function of
applied ﬁeld at ﬁxed temperature and as a function of temperature in a
ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld. See [20] for full details of the measurement protocols.

Single crystals of Ho2−xYxTi2O7 (x = 0, 0.1, 1, 1.6 and 2) were grown in
an image furnace using the ﬂoating zone technique [34].
The cylindrical
crystals were cut into circular disks ∼6 mm in diameter and ∼1 mm thick.
These disks were oriented using the Laue x-ray diﬀraction technique and
then glued, using GE varnish, in a circular pattern on to a silver sample
plate as shown in Fig. 5. The samples were covered with a thin (0.01 mm)
sheet of silver foil to improve thermal conductivity and mounted on the cold
stage of an Oxford Instruments 3He/4He dilution refrigerator.

13µSR Experiments
Muon spin rotation (µSR) experiments were performed using the MuSR
spectrometer at the ISIS pulsed muon facility, Rutherford Appleton Labo-
ratory, United Kingdom.
For the magnetic ﬁeld sweeps at ﬁxed temperature the samples were
zero-ﬁeld cooled to a temperature well below the eventual measuring tem-
perature, thermalised, and then slowly warmed in zero ﬁeld to the required
measuring temperature. A transverse external ﬁeld was then applied. For
these measurements each ﬁeld point took approximately 15 minutes to col-
lect. At the end of each ﬁeld sweep the magnetic ﬁeld was reduced to zero
and the sample warmed to 4 K. Note, during zero-ﬁeld cooling, the stray
ﬁelds at the sample position were cancelled to less than 3 µT by three pairs
of coils forming an active compensation system.
The temperature sweeps were always made following a ﬁeld sweep mea-
surement at base temperature. This means that in practice the samples were
zero-ﬁeld-cooled to the base temperature of the cryostat, thermalised and a
ﬁeld of 2 mT was applied in steps of 0.25 mT over a period of at least two
hours. Data were then collected in zero-ﬁeld-cooled warming (ZFCW) mode
by warming the sample to each measuring temperature up to maximum of
4 K and then in ﬁeld-cooled cooling (FCC) mode on subsequent cooling to
each measuring temperature. Each point in these temperature scans took
around 15 minutes to collect. Due to the large low-temperature hyperﬁne
contribution to the speciﬁc heat for the samples containing holmium, the
eﬀective base temperature of the dilution refrigerator for these samples was
limited to 100 mK.
Ho2Ti2O7 covered in thick silver foil
Muon spin rotation spectra for a sample of pure Ho2Ti2O7 covered with a
silver foil 0.25 mm thick were collected at ﬁxed temperature in 2 mT. The
temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate λ(T) extracted from
ﬁts to this data are shown in Fig. 6.
For the low-temperature data (T < TCR) the data were ﬁt using
A(t) = A0 cos(2πυt) exp(−λt),
(2)
where A0 is the initial muon asymmetry, υ = γµB/2π is the frequency of
the oscillations, and γµ is the gyromagnetic ratio.

λ(T ) extracted from ﬁts to the TF-µSR time spectra collected in
2 mT during ZFCW for a sample of Ho2Ti2O7 covered with 0.25
mm thick silver foil. At low temperature a ﬁt using Equation 2 gives λ.
At higher temperature a two component ﬁt using Equation 3 gives λ and
λ2.
In order to obtain satisfactory ﬁts to the data above TCR the modiﬁed
expression.
A(t) = A0 cos(2πυt) exp(−λt) + A2 exp(−λ2t)
(3)
was used. The additional A2 exp(−λ2t) term is required to take account of
the larger range stray ﬁelds within the thick silver foil. This is because the
muon facility at ISIS has a signiﬁcant momentum bite and so the implan-
tation distance for the lower energy muons will be less than those with a
higher energy.
