We examine the anisotropic properties of the exchange stiﬀness constant, A, for rare-earth per-
manent magnet, Nd2Fe14B, by connecting analyses with two diﬀerent scales of length, i.e., Monte
Carlo (MC) method with an atomistic spin model and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation
with a continuous magnetic model. The atomistic MC simulations are performed on the spin model
of Nd2Fe14B constructed from ab-initio calculations, and the LLG micromagnetics simulations are
performed with the parameters obtained by the MC simulations. We clarify that the amplitude
and the thermal property of A depend on the orientation in the crystal, which are attributed to
the layered structure of Nd atoms and weak exchange couplings between Nd and Fe atoms. We
also conﬁrm that the anisotropy of A signiﬁcantly aﬀects the threshold ﬁeld for the magnetization
reversal (coercivity) given by the depinning process.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In rare-earth permanent magnets such as Nd2Fe14B,
SmCo5, Sm2Fe17N3, and so on, the rare-earth elements
and the transition metals combine in atomic scale to
produce strong magnetic anisotropy and strong ferro-
magnetic order.
The strong magnetic anisotropy orig-
inated from the 4f-electrons of the rare-earth atom is
maintained at room temperature (RT) by an interac-
tion with the strong ferromagnetic order of the transi-
tion metals [1, 2]. However, in Nd2Fe14B which is well
known as the highest performance permanent magnet at
RT [3–5], improvement of coercivity at high temperature
is required for industrial application [6] because it has a
relatively low Curie temperature (∼585 K) as compared
with the other rare-earth magnets.
Coercivity mechanism of Nd2Fe14B and the other rare-
earth magnets has not been fully elucidated yet. To ana-
lyze intrinsic magnetic properties of the rare-earth mag-
nets (e.g., magnetization, magnetic anisotropy, exchange
stiﬀness, Curie temperature, etc.), we should consider the
inhomogeneous magnetic structures and thermal ﬂuctua-
tions in an atomic scale (∼˚A). The rare-earth magnets in
the practical use are polycrystalline materials composed
of the main rare-earth magnet phase (∼µm), and mag-
netic or non-magnetic grain boundary phases (∼nm).
Therefore, the coercivity depends on not only the intrin-
sic magnetic parameters, such as the anisotropy energy
of the main phase but also on the magnetic properties of
the grain boundary and microstructure of the main and
grain phases [7, 8]. For this reason, study of the coer-
civity requires analyses from the atomic scale (∼˚A) to
the macroscopic scale (∼µm). This fact has inhibited to
elucidate the coercivity in a systematic manner.
Theoretically analyses for the coercivity in most have
been carried out with a continuum model that uses the
magnetic anisotropy constants, Ku, and the exchange
stiﬀness constant, A as macroscopic parameters (see
Eq. (2)). In the junction systems consisting of hard and
soft magnetic phases [9–12], it has been indicated that
both Ku and A have a large eﬀect on incoherent magne-
tization reversals (i.e., nucleation and depinning) which
reduce the coercivity from the value of the uniform re-
versal. In order to elucidate the coercivity mechanism
and improve the coercivity at high temperatures, it is
important to clarify the temperature dependences of Ku
and A. Therefore, many researchers in both experimen-
tal and theoretical have studied the thermal properties of
Ku [13–18]. However, regarding A for Nd2Fe14B, experi-
mentally, the values are observed only at several temper-
atures [19–22], and also there is no theoretical estimation
of the temperature dependence as far as we know.
The value of A is given as a macroscopic properties of
exchange stiﬀness of continuous magnets at each temper-
ature. This quantity is related to the domain wall (DW)
width [23] and the critical (magnetization reversal) nu-
cleus size [7]. For some other magnetic materials, YCo5
and L10-type magnets (CoPt, FePd, FePt), Belashchenko
indicated using ab-initio calculation that A depends on
the orientation in the crystals[24]. And Fukazawa et al.
also pointed out the anisotropic A for Sm(Fe, Co)12 com-
pounds [25]. Recently, Nishino et al. examined the tem-
perature dependence of DW width of Nd2Fe14B using an
atomistic spin model constructed from ab-initio calcula-
tions, and indicated that it also has an orientation depen-
dence [26]. Although, in Ref. [24], the eﬀect of anisotropic
A on coercivity is also discussed in a phenomenological
way, microscopic understanding of the temperature and2
orientation dependences of A is essential for the coerciv-
ity mechanism in Nd2Fe14B magnet.
In the present paper, by a comparison of the results
obtained by a continuum model and those obtained by
the atomistic spin model constructed from ab-initio cal-
culations (same spin model as Ref. [18, 26, 27]), we study
the temperature and the orientation dependence of A for
Nd2Fe14B magnet.
The comparison of the two diﬀer-
ent scale models is done by making use of magnetic DW
energy. This scheme has been used successful for FePt
[28–30] and Co [31] magnetic materials. We ﬁnd that
A has the anisotropic property in Nd2Fe14B. Moreover,
the reason for the anisotropy is attributed to the weak
exchange couplings of Nd and Fe atoms. Additionally,
we performed micromagnetics simulations on the conﬁg-
uration in which a soft magnetic phase is attached to
(001) plane or (100) plane of a grain of Nd2Fe14B. The
simulations predict that the anisotropy of A reduces the
coercivity for the former conﬁguration because A of z-
direction is larger than that of x-direction, while it en-
hances the coercivity for the latter conﬁguration. The
series of the calculation schemes in the present study cor-
responds to the multiscale analysis[32, 33] that connects
diﬀerent scales from ab-initio calculation to coercivity as
macroscopic physics.

MODELS AND METHOD
A.
Atomistic Spin Model
To include the information of electronic states at an
atomistic scale, we treat the (spin) magnetic moment of
each atom as a classical spin and then construct a clas-
sical Heisenberg model. The atomistic Hamiltonian has
the form:
H = −2
X
i<j
˜Jijei · ej
−
X
i∈Fe
Di(ez
i )2 +
X
i∈Nd
X
l=2,4,6
Bml
l,i ˆOml
l,i ,
(1)
where ˜Jij is the Heisenberg exchange coupling constants
including the spin amplitudes (SiSj) between the ith and
jth sites, and ei is the normalized spin moment at the
ith site. The coeﬃcient, Di, in the second term denotes
the strength of the magnetic anisotropy of Fe sites. The
third term is the magnetic anisotropy of Nd sites, which is
formulated by the crystal ﬁeld theory for 4f-electrons[34,
35], Bml
l,i is the crystal electric ﬁeld coeﬃcient and ˆOml
l,i is
the Stevens operator. In the present study, Bml
l,i takes a
ﬁxed value, whereas ˆOml
l,i depends on the state of a total
angular momentum of 4f-electrons, J i. Here, we ﬁx J i
parallel to the normalized spin moment on the ith site,
i.e. J i = Jiei (Ji = 9/2 for Nd atom). For simplicity,
we consider only the diagonal terms ml = 0.
For these input parameters of Nd2Fe14B magnet,
we
adopt
the
same
values
in
the
previous
stud-
ies [18, 26, 27].
Exchange coupling constants,
˜Jij,
were calculated with Liechtenstein’s formula [36] on the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green’s-function code,
machikaneyama (akaikkr) [37]. In the present study,
to reduce computational cost, we use only short-range
exchange couplings within the range of rcut = 3.52 ˚A,
in which primary Fe–Fe and Nd–Fe interactions are in-
cluded. Anisotropy terms, Di and Bml
l,i , were determined
from the previous ﬁrst-principles calculation [38] and the
experimental result [35], respectively. Consequently, the
atomistic spin model uses many input parameters in a
unit cell which includes 68 atoms (see Fig. 1 (a)). The
previous study [18] conﬁrmed that the model and param-
eters are highly reliable for the magnetic properties of the
Nd2Fe14B magnet.
B.
Continuum Model
Under the continuum approximation, the micromag-
netic energy of the exchange couplings and the magnetic
anisotropies at temperature T is expressed as follows [39]:
Econt =
Z
V
d3r

X
l=x,y,z
Al(T ) (∇lm(r))2


+
Z
V
d3r EK(T, θ(r)),
(2)
where m denotes a normalized magnetization vector,
Al(T ) is the exchange stiﬀness constant of each direction
(x, y, z) in the crystal, and EK is the magnetic anisotropy
energy which is usually expressed as:
EK(T, θ) = K1(T ) sin2 θ + K2(T ) sin4 θ + K4(T ) sin6 θ,
(3)
where Ku(T ) (u = 1, 2, 4) are the magnetic anisotropy
constants and θ is the angle of magnetization measured
from z-axis. The continuum model uses the temperature-
dependent parameters to express the thermal eﬀects in-
stead of thermal ﬂuctuations in the atomistic model.
Micromagnetic simulations [39, 40] have been car-
ried out based on the continuum approximation and
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation which describes
time evolution of magnetization relaxation process (see
Sec.III C). In the practical simulation, the real space in
Eq. (2) is discretized with a grid whose width should
be smaller than a DW width and a magnetostatic ex-
change length [39]. In most micromagnetic simulations
for Nd2Fe14B magnet, each grid size was set to (1-2 nm)3,
and as the input parameters, experimentally observed
values of Al(T ) and Ku(T ) were used.
In the continuum model, many input parameters of
Eq. (1) in atomic scale are expected to be renormalized
in the few macroscopic parameters of Eq. (2) at each
temperature.3

tures were plotted using vesta [41].
C.
Methods for determining Ku(T ) and A(T )
In the present study, the macroscopic parameters are
evaluated by comparing the energies of the DW and of
the magnetic anisotropy obtained by the above two mod-
els at each temperature. We use a Monte Carlo (MC)
scheme to calculate Helmholtz free energies on the atom-
istic spin model. In order to evaluate A, we consider the
two quantities obtained from DW energy: Edw(T ) and
Fdw(T ) [23, 29]. Edw is the DW energy in the continuum
model, which is expressed by the following formula:
Edw(T ) = 2
p
A(T )
Z π
0
dθ
p
EK(T, θ).
(4)
To obtain A(T ), we need the values of Edw(T ) and
EK(T, θ). We regard Edw(T ) to be equal to the DW free
energy in the atomistic spin model, Fdw(T ), which is ex-
pressed by the following formula:
Fdw(T ) = T
Z ∞
T
dT ′ Edw(T ′)
(T ′)2
.
(5)
The DW internal energy, Edw(T ), is deﬁned as an en-
ergy diﬀerence between the internal energies obtained in
diﬀerent boundary conditions with and without DW. For
this calculation, we ﬁx the boundaries in the direction an-
tiparallel (AP) or parallel (PA). Additionally, since the
crystal structure of Nd2Fe14B has anisotropy, we con-
sider two models with the two ﬁxed boundaries depicted
in Fig. 1(b) and (c). Thus, we have two types of DWs [26].
One is a DW along the yz-plane (type I), and the other is
along the xy-plane (type II). We set the periodic bound-
ary condition in the yz(xy)-plane for the model of type I
(type II).
To calculate EK(T, θ), we adopt the constrained MC
(C-MC) method for the atomistic spin model. The C-MC
method samples spin conﬁgurations under the condition
of a ﬁxed angle of total magnetization, which allows us to
calculate the angle dependence of the spin torque and the
free energy [42]. By considering that EK is equal to the
free energy of magnetic anisotropy, we calculate EK from
the atomistic model. The previous study [18] showed the
validity of the C-MC methods for calculating Ku(T ) in
EK(T, θ) of the Nd2Fe14B atomistic spin model.
Note
that if Eq. (3) is given in the form EK = K1 sin2 θ (K2 =
K4 = 0), Eq. (4) can be integrated analytically and gives
the well known relation: Edw(T ) = 4
p
A(T )K1(T ).
In the present paper, the MC and C-MC simulations
run 100000-200000 MC steps for equilibrium and the fol-
lowing 100000-200000 MC steps for taking statistical av-
erages, where a MC step corresponds to one trial for each
spin to be updated. We calculated the average of mag-
netic anisotropy energies and DW energies from 8-20 dif-
ferent runs with diﬀerent initial conditions and random
sequences.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Magnetic anisotropy and domain wall energy
As mentioned above, the evaluation of the exchange
stiﬀness constant requires precise calculations of the mag-
netic anisotropy constants and the DW energy.
First,
we show the temperature dependence of the magnetic
anisotropy constants calculated by the C-MC method in
Fig. 2, which qualitatively agrees with previous experi-
ments [14, 15]. There, we used the system of 10 × 10 × 7
unit cells imposing the periodic boundary conditions. In
uniaxial anisotropy, we study the quantities: FA(T ) ≡
EK(T, θ = π/2) = EK(T, π/2) −EK(T, 0) = P
u Ku(T ).
Figure 2 shows that FA(T ) rapidly decreases with the
temperature below 400 K. This temperature dependence
is understood as a result of fragile thermal properties
of Nd atoms.
That is, while at low temperature, the
anisotropy of Nd atoms is dominant, the anisotropy of4

(8, 8, 6), (10, 10, 7), and the extrapolation data (Lx ∝N 1/3 →
∞).
Nd atoms decreases with the temperature more rapidly
than that of Fe atoms, because the exchange ﬁeld of a
Nd atom (sum of exchange couplings that connect to a
Nd atom) is much smaller (about 20-25 %) than that of
a Fe atom (see also the detailed discussion in Ref. [18]).
Additionally, owing to the higher order terms of the
Nd anisotropy, B0
4, B0
6, the magnetization of Nd2Fe14B
is tilted from the z-axis at low temperatures. This fact
causes that the deviation from uniaxial anisotropy occurs
in the region of −2K2 < K1 < 0 [43]. Note that Eq. (4) is
deﬁned under the condition of uniaxial anisotropy. And
thus, in the present paper, we discuss the DW energy
and the exchange stiﬀness in the region of T ≥200 K.
As a matter of practice, ﬁnite-size eﬀect of numeri-
cal results about the magnetic anisotropy is signiﬁcant
for the evaluation of the exchange stiﬀness and the DW
width, especially at high temperatures.
To avoid this
problem, we extrapolate FA(T ) and

[these are used in Eqs. (7) and (4)] to the thermodynamic
limit (N →∞) using linear functions in N −1/3. Figure 3
shows the typical ﬁtting results which indicate that the
MC results are well ﬁtted with the linear functions. The
extrapolated results for FA near the Curie temperature,
TC, are summarized in the inset of Fig. 2, where we ﬁx
as Ku = 0 above TC (= 870 K). We use these extrapo-
lated results to evaluate the exchange stiﬀness and the
DW width.
Next, we focus on the DW energy. Figure 4 shows the
temperature dependence of the DW internal energy, Edw,
for the two DW types (see Fig. 1). We also plot Edw for
three diﬀerent system sizes in the directions perpendic-
ular to the DWs, i.e. Lx =14, 17, and 21 (Lz =10, 12,
and 15), for type I (type II). From these results, it is con-
ﬁrmed that these systems are large enough to calculate

Edw. To analyze in detail the temperature dependence,
we divided Edw into the magnetic anisotropy term (EK
dw)
and the exchange term (EJ
dw), and plot the contributions
in Fig. 4. The DW energies of type I and type II show a
qualitatively similar temperature dependence. Both en-
ergy terms naturally vanish for T ≥TC, because DW
does not appear even in the AP boundary condition. For
T < TC, the anisotropy term decreases monotonically as
the temperature increases whereas the exchange term in-
creases and takes a peak value at the temperature, Th,
slightly below TC.
The temperature dependences are interpreted as fol-
lows.
The monotonic decrease of EK
dw is merely due
to the decrease of the thermally averaged magnetic mo-
ments, which also corresponds to the decrease of FA(T )
in Fig. 2. The magnetic anisotropy energy depends on
the angle from z-axis of each spin, whereas the exchange
coupling energy depends on the relative angle of spin
pairs. Now, the DW energy is deﬁned as the diﬀerence of
the internal energies between the PA (EPA) and the AP
(EAP) boundary conditions, i.e., Edw(T ) = EPA −EAP.
EJ
dw is the part coming from the exchange term, thus it
is inﬂuenced by the diﬀerence between the two bound-
ary conditions in the ﬂuctuations of the relative angles
of spin pairs. In the conﬁguration of the AP boundary
condition, DW exists. In the DW, the ferromagnetic or-
der is weakened because the spin conﬁguration is forcibly
twisted, and the DW has a spiral non-collinear structure
with the perpendicular (xy) component at low tempera-
tures. This fact gives the diﬀerence of the energies EJ
dw.
We expect that EJ
dw due to the formation of the non-
collinear structure would be enhanced near the critical
point where the width of DW increases.
At a temperature Th which is slightly lower than TC,
the proﬁle of perpendicular (xy) moments is destroyed by5

the thermal ﬂuctuation. As a thermally averaged mag-
netic structure, the non-collinear structure (the spiral
structure) becomes a collinear structure. At this point,
EJ
dw takes the peak value at Th and then decreases rapidly
and approaches zero towards TC.
This break of the
non-collinear structure was discussed in previous stud-
ies as the disappearance of an xy–magnetization inside
the DW [29, 44, 45].
By those internal DW energies and Eq. (5), we can
calculate DW free energies, Fdw. In Fig. 5, we plot the
temperature dependence of Fdw and Edw (the same data
shown in Fig. 4) for both DW types.
The diﬀerences
between Fdw and Edw correspond to the contribution of
magnetic entropy. The diﬀerence in the DW energy be-
tween type I and type II naturally indicates an anisotropy
concerning to the direction in which DWs are generated.
The DW prefers to be generated in the conﬁguration of
type II. These observations imply the magnetization re-

Here, we deﬁne the value of A calculated from the con-
ﬁguration of type I (type II) as the exchange stiﬀness
constant of the x (z)-direction, Ax(z).
Reﬂecting the
anisotropy of the DW energy, the exchange stiﬀness con-
stant naturally has the anisotropy depending on the di-
rection in the crystal. For the comparison of A with ex-
perimental values, it is reasonable to normalize the tem-
perature dependence with TC, because the spin model
overestimates (T MC

(T EXP

≃585 K). In addition, as pointed in the mean
ﬁeld approximation[46], A is roughly proportional to TC,
so that we also rescale the values of A:

The inset of Fig. 6 shows the rescaled data and experi-
mental values (green bar) at RT [21, 22]. Although the
experimental values have some variation (6.6-12.5 pJ/m),
the calculation results are well consistent with the lower
experimental values at RT.
With A and Ku which have been obtained, the DW
width, δdw, is calculated from the following relation [15,

.
To conﬁrm the validity of our evaluation procedure for
A, in Fig. 7, we compared our results (circle) with those
of the previous study (square) [26].
In the previous study, δdw was evaluated directly from
the snapshots of spin conﬁgurations using the same atom-
istic Hamiltonian of the present study. Note that, we set
the periodic boundary condition in the yz(xy)-plane for
the model of type I (type II), whereas the previous cal-
culation was performed under the open-boundary condi-
tions for both models. Our results of δdw qualitatively
agree with the previous results, although they tend to
take a smaller value because the thermal ﬂuctuation be-
comes smaller than the previous study due to the diﬀer-
ence of boundary conditions. The comparisons with the
previous experiments and the numerical study as men-
tioned above guarantee our results concerning to A.
Now, we study its thermal properties. The temper-
ature dependence of A is often discussed in relation to
magnetization by using the following expression:
A(T ) = A(0)
M(T )
M(0)
n
,
(8)
where M(T ) is the amplitude of the magnetization (not
shown, see Ref. [18]). Under a mean ﬁeld approxima-
tion with homogeneous spin systems, the exponent n
is 2 [30, 46].
However, under more accurate methods,
the exponent takes a value diﬀerent from 2, for exam-
ple, FePt:
n = 1.76 [30], hcp-Co:
n = 1.79 [31].
Thus we estimate n to examine the thermal properties
for the Nd2Fe14B, by ﬁtting A(T ) in Fig. 6 with the
form CM(T )n, where C is a ﬁtting constant.
Note
that n depends on the ﬁtting range of temperature
nx(z) = 1.68 (1.84) in the range of 200-860 K, whereas
nx(z) = 1.46 (1.69) in the range of 200-400 K. Fitting
lines of the former and the latter are plotted by the solid
and dotted lines in Fig. 6, respectively. Microscopically,
Fe and Nd show diﬀerent thermal properties. Indeed, Nd
atoms have weak exchange coupling and so do not have
much inﬂuence on A, whereas they have a large magnetic
moment (∼2.87 µB/atom).
The magnetization of Nd
atoms is decreased more rapidly with temperature than
that of Fe atoms, which largely aﬀects the temperature
dependence of total magnetization. Thus, intrinsically n
depend on the ﬁtting range largely. However, the impor-
tant point here is that nz always takes larger values than
nx regardless of the ﬁtting range (we checked it). This
relation implies the macroscopic exchange coupling in the
z-direction is weaker than that in x-direction, not only
for the coupling strength but also for thermal tolerance.
As the reason for the anisotropy of A to crystal ori-
entation, the crystal structure of Nd2Fe14B is naturally
invoked.
Nd2Fe14B has the layered structure of Fe-
layer and NdFe-layer (B has little eﬀect on magnetic
properties) along the z-axis as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In
Nd2Fe14B, exchange couplings ( ˜Jij in Eq. (1)) are mainly
contributed by bonding between Fe and Fe atoms, ˜JFe-Fe,
and between Nd and Fe atoms, ˜JNd-Fe (| ˜JNd-Nd| is neg-
ligibly small). Each bond of ˜JFe-Fe has much larger am-
plitudes than ˜JNd-Fe ( ˜JFe-Fe : −4.35 - 22.34 meV, ˜JNd-Fe :
−0.16 - 3.55 meV). Therefore, it is anticipated that the
anisotropy of A comes from the inhomogeneous distribu-
tion of the exchange couplings and the atom positions
in the crystal structure. To support this anticipation in7

detail, we examine the relation between the anisotropy
and the strength of ˜JNd-Fe.
Figure 8 shows the ratio of Az to Ax for four models
with diﬀerent values of ˜JNd-Fe. Beside the default model
(1.0 ˜JNd-Fe, the ratio is calculated from Fig. 6), we also
calculate other three cases with all the bonds ˜JNd-Fe re-
duced by half (0.5 ˜JNd-Fe), increased by half (1.5 ˜JNd-Fe),
and doubled (2.0 ˜JNd-Fe). It is clearly found that A gets
close to isotropic (i.e., Az = Ax) as ˜JNd-Fe increase in
the whole temperature range.
As another feature, the ratio slowly decreases with the
temperature for all the cases, which indicates that the
temperature dependence of Ax and Az are diﬀerent. This
diﬀerence corresponds to the diﬀerence between nx and
nz in Eq. (8). As the temperature increases, the contri-
bution of ˜JNd-Fe to A becomes smaller than that of ˜JFe-Fe
because the spin moments of Nd atoms are more easily
broken by thermal ﬂuctuations compared with those of
Fe atoms. From the above analysis, we conclude that the
reason of the anisotropy of A in Nd2Fe14B comes from
the weakness of ˜JNd-Fe and the layered structure of Nd
atoms.
C.
Eﬀect of anisotropic exchange on coercivity
Let us consider the eﬀects of the anisotropy of A on the
coercivity. In actual rare-earth magnets which are com-
posed of main rare-earth magnet phase and (magnetic or
non-magnetic) grain boundary phase, magnetization re-
versal is considered to occur by nucleation near the inter-
face and by the DW propagation. Thus, to study magne-
tization reversal in such a process, we carried out micro-
magnetic simulations for the two-phase models composed
of the soft magnetic phase and the hard magnetic phase,
depicted in Fig. 9 (a) and Fig. 9 (b). The soft phase rep-
resents the grain boundary phase. The two models (a)
and (b) are the same if we do not take into account the
anisotropy of A and the dipole-dipole interaction.
The simulations are based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
method and the LLG equation [39, 40]:

where Mi is the magnetization vector of ith cell, γ is the

cubic cell of (1.0 nm)3 and we set |γ| = 2.21×105 m/A·sec
(the value of free electron) and α = 1 (coercivity does not
depend on α). Eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld on ith cell, Heﬀ

neighbor cells of the ith cell, mi = Mi/|Mi|, eu is the
unit vector of the easy axis, dij is the distance between
the centers of ith and jth cells (i.e. dij = 1.0 nm), Aij
is the exchange stiﬀness costant, and Ki
1 is the magnetic
anisotropy constant (terms of Ki
2 and Ki
4 were omitted
for simplicity).
In the present study, we determine the input model
parameters in Eq.(10) from the MC results at 400 K. The
model parameters in the hard phases are set to |Mi| =
1.38 T, Ki
1 = 2.63 MJ/m3, Aij = 12.21 pJ/m for the pairs
of iz = jz, and Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for the pairs of iz ̸= jz,
where iz(jz) is the position of the i(j)th cell in the z-
axis. In the soft phases, the model parameters are set to
|Mi| = 1.38 T, Ki
1 = 0 MJ/m3, and Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for
all the pairs of (i, j). The diﬀerence of Aij in the direction
for the hard phases reﬂects the anisotropy of A in the MC
results. In addition, we assume Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for the
bonds connecting the soft/hard interfaces.
By
applying
the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algo-
rithm [48]
to
the
LLG
equation
with
the
above-
constructed models, we simulated the magnetization re-
versal dynamics and then evaluated the coercivity.
In
the simulation, we set the Runge-Kutta time step to
0.1 ps, the magnetic ﬁeld (Hext) is reduced by 25 mT
at each ﬁeld step, and the convergence condition under
each ﬁeld is when the average of magnetization torque,
|mi × Heﬀ
i |, is lower than 1.0 mOe. Also, to avoid the
case of mi×Heﬀ

a disturbance is added to the magnetization vector of ev-
ery cell as mi →(mi +v)/|mi +v|, where v is a random
vector of length 10−4. Using the simulation conditions,8

the magnetization reversal of the hard phase (not includ-
ing the soft phase) occurs at 4.80 T which is consistent
with the Stoner-Wohlfarth limit, 2K1/Ms = 4.789 T.
In such the two-phase models, a magnetization rever-
sal is expected to start from the soft phase. Thus, we
also examine the inﬂuence of soft phase thickness, sl. In
Fig. 9 (c), we plot sl dependence of the coercivity for the
models (a) and (b). It is clearly seen that the coercivity
of the model (a) is weaker than that of the model (b)
regardless of sl. The relation of the coercivities between
the two models is also consistent with that of the magsni-
tude of DW energy in each direction (see Fig. 5). Since
the models (a) and (b) are equivalent in the absence of
anisotropy of Aij in the hard phase, we can conclude
that the diﬀerence of the coercivityu is attributed to the
anisotropic A.
It is also seen that as sl increases, the coercivity de-
creases and gradually approaches a certain value for each
model, and the diﬀerence between two models increases.
As we will see in the following two paragraphs, this be-
havior is explained as a change in magnetization reversal
mechanism from nucleation type to depinning type. Here
we deﬁne the nucleation type as a magnetization reversal
of the whole system occurs by a nucleation which starts
from nucleation at the surface of the soft phase with-
out depinning at the interface of the soft and hard parts,
while in the depinning type, the reversed magnetization
in the soft phase is pinned at the interface until the mag-
netic ﬁeld reaches the threshold of the depinning.
Figure 9 (d) shows the hysteresis loops (showing the
only upper part in the ﬁgure) for the model (a) with four
diﬀerent sl. When the soft phase is thin (sl = 1, 3 nm),
the magnetization of the hard phase is reversed at the
same time as the nucleation at the soft phase (i.e., the
nucleation type), whereas when the soft phase is thick
(sl = 5, 7 nm), coercivity is determined not from the nu-
cleation but from the depinning (i.e., the depinning type).
The change between the nucleation type and depinning
type were also pointed out in the previous studies for
a one-dimensional model in which a soft phase of ﬁnite
width is sandwiched between hard phases [9–12] and a
corner defect model [49].
In the one-dimentional model an analytical solution of
the coercivity in the limit sl →∞, which means the
depinning type, was also proposed as follows [10, 11]:

(11)
where |M S(H)|, KS(H)
1
, and AS(H) are the model param-
eters of Eq. (10) in soft (hard) phase. To apply Eq. (11)
to the three-dimensional models, as the value of AH, we
use the value of Aij in the direction perpendicular to the
soft/hard interface, and calculate Hdwp. Dashed lines in
Fig. 9 (c) indicate Hdwp for the models, which seems to
explain well the lower limit of depinning type coercivity
for our three-dimensional models. Therefore, it is under-
stood that the anisotropy of A has a large eﬀect on the
coercivity of the depinning type compared with that of
the nucleation type.
Finally, we study the inﬂuence of the dipole-dipole in-
teraction on the coercivity in the two models. Magnetic
ﬁeld due to the dipole-dipole interaction is incorporated
in Heﬀ

as the following form:
Hdip

K(rij)Mj,
(12)
where K(rij) is the demagnetization tensor [40], rij is the
distance vector between i and j cells. Here the strength of
the dipole-dipole interaction is determined automatically
according to the distance of the pair and the magnetiza-
tion vector of the cells. We calculate Hdip
i
of all the cells
in O(NclogNc) computational time (Nc is the total num-
ber of cells) by solving convolution integral using the fast
Fourier transform method [50]. In the present study, we
set the models (a) and (b) in Fig. 9 are cubic regardless
of sl and M H = M S, and thus the models (a) and (b)
have the same shape magnetic anisotropy.
Upper ﬁgures of Fig. 10 show sl dependence of coerciv-
ity for the two models (a) and (b) with dipole-dipole in-9

teraction. The red circles and the red dotted lines (Hdwp)
represent the values of the coercivity which are calculated
using the same input parameters (|Mi|, Ki
1, and Aij) as
those in Fig. 9 (c). Here, the diﬀerence of coercivity in
the models (a) and (b) in Fig. 10 is mainly attributed
to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the anisotropic A
is a secondary eﬀect. Because dipole-dipole interaction
prefers to construct the DW along z-axis (type I), in the
model (b), the coercivity decreases compared with that
in Fig. 9 (c). Conversely in the model (a), the coercivity
increases in the region of sl ≥3nm. The dipole-dipole
interaction inhibits to construct the DW (nucleation) in
xy-plane.
For this reason, the coercivity with dipole-
dipole interaction depends on the arrangement of the soft
phase, which works contrary to the eﬀect of anisotropic
exchange stiﬀness, Ax > Az.
These behaviors are conﬁrmed from the hysteresis
loops in lower ﬁgures in Fig. 10. In the model (b), mag-
netization reversal is clearly separated into the two parts,
i.e., the small jump at the lower magnetic ﬁeld where only
the soft phase is reversed (nucleation), and the jump at
the higher magnetic ﬁeld where the DW is depinned at
the interface (depinning). In contrast, in the model (a)
they are not clearly distinguished. That is, in the model
(a), the magnetization reversal mechanism becomes to
approach the nucleation type from the depinning type
by the dipole-dipole interaction. The dependence of the
coercivity on the arrangement of the soft phase were sim-
ilarly discussed in the most recent study (not including
the anisotropy of A) [51].
It is diﬃcult to clarify the eﬀect of anisotropic A on
the coercivity under the dipole-dipole interaction by a
simple comparison the models (a) and (b). Thus, we ex-
changed the values of Ax,y and Az in the hard phase.
Namely, we set the input parameters of the hard phase
as Aij = 9.10 pJ/m for iz = jz, and Aij = 12.21 pJ/m for
iz ̸= jz. The values of coercivity under these conditions
are plotted by the blue circles and the blue lines (Hdwp)
in the upper ﬁgures of Fig. 10. The anisotropy of A has a
similar eﬀect on the coercivity as the case without dipole-
dipole interaction. However, in the model (a), the diﬀer-
ence in coercivity is relatively small. The anisotropic A
strongly aﬀects the coercivity of the depinning type com-
pared with the nucleation type. On the other hand, The
magnetization reversal in the model (a) is the nucleation
type rather than the depinning type. Therefore, we may
conclude the dipole-dipole interaction in the model (a)
suppresses the eﬀect of the anisotropy of A.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Regarding the exchange stiﬀness constant,
A,
of
Nd2Fe14B, we examined the temperature and orienta-
tion dependences using the Monte Carlo simulations with
the atomistic spin model constructed from the ab-initio
calculation.
We also conducted the coercivity calcula-
tions based on the micromagnetics (LLG) simulations us-
ing the continuum model with the parameters obtained
by the atomic scale MC results at ﬁnite temperatures.
In this way, we conﬁrmed that the lattice structure in
the atomic scale aﬀects the coercivity as macroscopic
physics. We found that A(T ) depends on the orienta-
tion of the crystal with respect to not only the ampli-
tude but also the exponent nx(z) in the scaling behav-
ior:
Ax(z)(T ) ∝M(T )nx(z); namely Ax(T ) > Az(T )
and nx < nz.
It is quantitatively conﬁrmed that the
anisotropic properties of A come from the weak exchange
couplings between Nd and Fe atoms and the layered
structure of Nd atoms. Moreover, we also found that the
anisotropic A(T ) aﬀects the coercivity of the depinning
mechanism.
We focused on only Nd2Fe14B magnet in the present
paper.
However, the essence of anisotropic A comes
from the weak exchange coupling between rare-earth
atoms and transition metals and the layered structure
of rare-earth atoms.
Thus, the features discussion for
Nd2Fe14B are probably applicable to other rare-earth
magnets. In fact, it was pointed out by ab-initio calcu-10
lations that A have strong anisotropy for YCo5 [24] and
Sm(Fe,Co)12 [25].
Let us consider the coercivity from the viewpoint of
the exchange spring magnet [52, 53] which is composed
of hard and soft phase and expected to realize the highest
performance magnet. Because realization of high perfor-
mance requires a large coercivity and a large thickness
of soft phase, the model (a) with Ax < Az (Fig. 10 (a)
blue line) is the most suitable conditions in our model-
ings. Most strong permanent magnets, Nd2Fe14B, YCo5
and also L10-type magnet (CoPt, FePd, FePt) cannot
reproduce the same condition because Ax > Az [24],
whereas Sm(Fe,Co)12 would do because the anisotropy
as Ax < Az [25].
Therefore, Sm(Fe,Co)12 and other
R(Fe,Co)12-type compounds (R is a rare-earth element)
may have higher potential to realize strong performance
exchange spring magnet rather than the other magnets.
Finally, we point out another source of the anisotropy.
In a recent experiment, it has been observed that the
grain boundary phase takes diﬀerent crystal structures
and chemical compositions depending on the orientation
with the Nd2Fe14B main phase, i.e., the Nd-rich crys-
talline paramagnetic phase form on the xy-plane of the
main phase, whereas the Fe-rich amorphous ferromag-
netic phase in the plane parallel to the z-axis[54]. In the
present paper, we have studied the eﬀect of anisotropy
of A on coercivity and of the orientation of the interface
with the soft phase changes by using the same interac-
tion for the interface. However, if the chemical structure
is diﬀerent, the exchange interaction would be a diﬀer-
ence due to another source of the anisotropy, which is
studied with information of the structure in the future.
In the continuum model, Eq. (2), we used the values
of Ku and A obtained by the MC simulations which
are the values of the bulk system.
There, changes in
atomic scale of magnetic anisotropy[55–57] and exchange
coupling [58–61] near the interface or surface were not
taken into consideration.
The inﬂuences of interface
and surface are important for the coercivity [6]. Thus,
the accuracy multiscale analysis needs further develop-
ment of connecting scheme from atomistic spin model to
macrospin model would be necessary.
As another point noted is the range of exchange in-
teraction. In the atomistic spin model, Eq. (1), of the
present study, we omitted the long-range contribution of
˜Jij for simplicity and reduction of calculation cost. How-
ever, the recent study [62] reported that RKKY-type ex-
change coupling signiﬁcantly eﬀects on the DW width,
and pointed out the importance of the long-range contri-
bution. We also found that, by incorporating long-range
exchange couplings up to 10.6 ˚A, the diﬀerence between
type I and type II of Edw at 400 K reduces from 11.3 %
(in Fig. 5) to 4.4 %. However, to make study the eﬀect
clearly, we need precise information of the interaction at
the long distance, and we postpone to study this problem
later.
Although there are still problems that must be con-
cerned, we believe that the present paper will be helpful
to elucidate coercivity mechanism in rare-earth perma-
nent magnets.
