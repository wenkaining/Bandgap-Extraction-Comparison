Kagome superconductors with TC up to 7K have been discovered over 40 years. Recently, 
unconventional chiral charge order has been reported in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, 
with an ordering temperature of one order of magnitude higher than the TC. However, the 
chirality of the charge order has not been reported in the cousin kagome superconductor 
CsV3Sb5, and the electronic nature of the chirality remains elusive. In this letter, we report 
the observation of electronic chiral charge order in CsV3Sb5 via scanning tunneling 
microscopy (STM). We observe a 2×2 charge modulation and a 1×4 superlattice in both 
topographic data and tunneling spectroscopy. 2×2 charge modulation is highly anticipated 
as a charge order by fundamental kagome lattice models at van Hove filling, and is shown 
to exhibit intrinsic chirality. We find that the 1×4 superlattices forms various small 
domain walls, and can be a surface effect as supported by our first-principles calculations. 
Crucially, we find that the amplitude of the energy gap opened by the charge order 
exhibits real space modulations, and features 2×2 wave vectors with chirality, highlighting 
the electronic nature of the chiral charge order. STM study at 0.4K reveals a 
superconducting energy gap with a gap size 2Δ=0.85meV, which estimates a moderate 
superconductivity coupling strength with 2Δ/kBTC=3.9. When further applying a c-axis 
magnetic field, vortex core bound states are observed within this gap, indicative of clean-
limit superconductivity. 
 
 
Owing to the unusual lattice geometry, spins on kagome lattices can be geometrically frustrated 
and form a quantum spin liquid [1,2]. Similarly, a fundamental tight-binding model of kagome 
lattice considering the nearest neighboring hoping will produce an intriguing electronic band 
structure containing Dirac cones, flat band, and van Hove singularities. Thus, materials 
containing kagome lattices are an exciting platform to explore the quantum level interplay 
between geometry, correlation, and topology. For instance, certain kagome magnets are found 
to exhibit electronic nematicity, giant spin-orbit tunability, and topological Chern quantum 
phases [3-16]. Kagome superconductors with competing orders have been identified for over 
40 years [17-19], such as LaRu3Si2 with TC of 7K and a fundamental kagome band structure 
[20]. Recently, another layered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) was 
discovered with TC up to 2.5K for A=Cs [21-23], providing new research avenues, particularly 
for transport and STM studies [21-33].  
 
High-quality single crystals of CsV3Sb5 were grown by a self-flux method with Cs-Sb binary 
eutectic mixture (Cs0.4Sb0.6) as the flux [21]. We found that the molar ratio of Cs0.4Sb0.6: 
CsV3Sb5 = 15:1 is the best condition for obtaining large crystals with high quality. In order to 
obtain high-quality crystals, it is necessary to perform surface treatment of raw materials in a 
hydrogen atmosphere [34,35]. Our crystals have shiny surfaces with a hexagonal shape, and the 
typical size of crystals is about 3×4×0.5 mm3, as shown in the left inset of Figure 1(b). The3 
 
crystal structure was analyzed via X-ray diffraction using a θ-2θ scan. The magnetic 
susceptibility and magnetization were measured in a physical property measurement system 
magnetometer in vibrating-sample measurement mode. The transport property measurements 
were carried out in a five-contact configuration so that the longitudinal and Hall resistivity can 
be taken simultaneously. STM data were obtained with a Pt/Ir tip at 4.2K and 0.4K. The 
topographic data were obtained in a constant current mode with bias voltage V=50mV and 
current I=0.05nA. Spectroscopic data were obtained with V=50mV and I=0.5nA V=50mV at 
4.2K, and V=5mV and I=0.1nA at 0.4K. 
 
 
CsV3Sb5 crystallizes in the hexagonal P6/mmm space group, consists of V-Sb slabs that are 
intercalated by cesium cation, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The most notable feature in this 
compound is that the vanadium sublattice forms a 2D kagome net. X-ray diffraction pattern 
displays sharp (00l) reflection peaks, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) of (004) peak is only 0.07°, as shown in the right inset of Fig. 1(b). Both resistivity 
data [Fig. 1(c)] and susceptibility data [Fig. 1(d)] show two phase transitions. The 90K 
transition corresponds to the development of a charge order, and the 2.5K transition corresponds 
to the development of superconductivity. Below the charge order transition temperature, 
previous studies reveal the possibility of anomalous Hall effect [24,25]. Similar to these studies, 
at 5K, both the magnetization data [Fig. 1(f)] and the Hall resistivity data [Fig. 1(e)] as a 
function of the magnetic field applied along the c-axis show a double kink feature. By further 
subtracting a linear background as the ordinary Hall response, this unusual Hall response would 
resemble an anomalous Hall effect, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(e). Our low-field 
magnetization loop data in the inset of Fig. 1(f) also confirms the absence of magnetic hysteresis. 
The observation of anomalous Hall effect and increasing magnetization below charge ordering 
temperature with decreasing temperature implies the highly unconventional nature of the charge 
order. 
 
In this material, the V and Sb layers have a stronger chemical bonding, and the material tends 
to cleave between Cs and Sb layers. The Sb surface is most interesting, as it is strongly bonded 
to the V kagome lattice. Previous STM studies have resolved Sb honeycomb surfaces in AV3Sb5, 
and studied the charge order and surface superlattices [20-26]. We study CsV3Sb5 with STM at 
4.2K. Through cryogenic cleaving, we have also obtained large Sb surfaces in CsV3Sb5, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). Similar to KV3Sb5 [28], we observe a soft charge order gap opening from -
23meV to +35meV [Fig. 2(b)]. The Fourier transform of the topography confirms the 2×2 
charge order as marked by the shaded red region in Fig. 2(c), which is ubiquitous for all AV3Sb5 
compounds. In defect-free areas of KV3Sb5 and RbV3Sb5, the 2×2 charge order is found to 
display a chirality [28,29], where its three vector peaks have different intensities. We thus 
perform a spectroscopic map in a defect-free area [Fig. 1(d)] for CsV3Sb5 to check the existence 
of the chirality. The energy-resolved intensity of three 2×2 vector peaks is displayed in Fig. 
2(e), where we observe clear intensity differences. The observed anisotropy can be due to a 
chiral charge order as observed and discussed in certain transition-metal dichalcogenides and 
high-temperature superconductors [36,37]. The chirality can be defined as the counting 
direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) from the lowest to the highest pair of vector peaks. By4 
 
contrast, near a defect-rich region [Fig. 2(f)], we find that there is almost no chirality for the 
charge order [Fig. 2(g)], which suggests the existence of extrinsic effects. In both cases, the 
intensity of Q1 is strongest, and along this direction, there are additional 1×4 superlattice vector 
peaks in the q-space data [Fig. 2(c)]. This observation suggests an interplay between the 1×4 
superlattice and 2×2 charge order. 
 
The 1×4 superlattice is not observed on the Sb surface in KV3Sb5 [28], certain Sb surface in 
CsV3Sb5 [30], and the K/Cs/Rb surfaces in AV3Sb5. We also find many domains of the 1×4 
superlattice, including 120-degree domains [Fig. 3(a)] and phase shift domains [Fig. 3(b)]. The 
domain size can be very small (less than 10nm), which will not be energy favorable if it is bulk 
in nature. In addition, bulk X-ray measurements have detected the 2×2 charge order but have 
not yet observed the 1×4 superlattice [21,28]. Therefore, these pieces of experimental evidence 
taken together suggest that the 1×4 superlattice effect is likely to be fragile and of surface origin. 
For another example, it is known that the 1×2 superlattice observed by STM in BaFe2As2 is a 
polar surface effect [38], and there can be various small domain walls of the 1×2 superlattices, 
as similarly observed here. To explore the surface origin possibility, we perform first-principles 
calculations. The geometry optimizations of surface atoms were performed in the framework 
of density-functional theory with the projector augmented wave method and the PBE exchange-
correlation functional [39], which are implemented in the Vienna Ab into Simulation Package 
[40]. We built two types of 1×4 supercells slabs, repeating the primitive cell in two different 
directions: parallel (Type-A) and vertical (Type-B) to the a-axis. After fully relaxed surface 
atoms, we found only the Type-B slab is stabilized into the 1×4 supercell, which is consistent 
with our experimental measurements. Our calculations show that 1×4 supercells are due to the 
in-plane shifting of V atoms relative to surface Sb atoms, as indicated by the black arrows in 
Fig. 3(c). 
 
Previous first-principles calculation [28,41] in AV3Sb5 has also confirmed that the 2×2 charge 
order is a bulk effect and is consistent with a hexamer and trimer formation [28] (or termed as 
inverse star of David formation [41]) in the V kagome lattice. The chirality feature of the charge 
order, however, is beyond the current first-principles calculation. Prior to any theoretical 
discussion of the origin of chirality, it is crucial to explore whether the chirality is of electronic 
nature. An issue in the differential conductance mapping presented in Fig. 2 is that it cannot 
distinguish the electronic contribution from the structural contribution, as the tunneling junction 
setup can often have a dependence on structure features. However, it is generally believed that 
the energy gap of the charge order is of electronic origin. We therefore systematically measure 
the energy gap of the charge order at each spatial point and map out the spatial distribution of 
the charge order gap value as shown in Fig. 4(a), which reveals a striking spatial modulation of 
the energy gap value. The Fourier transform of the gap map in Fig. 4(b) shows the 2×2 vector 
peaks with clear anisotropy, thus similarly defining a chirality in the electronic charge order. 
We have further checked this phenomenon in the cousin kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5 in 
Figs. 4(c) and (d), and observed similar chirality of the electronic charge order. In Fig. 4 (e), 
we show typical linecut dI/dV spectrums along the line draw in Fig. 4(c), further illustrating 
the charge order gap modulation in real-space.5 
 
The observation of electronic chiral charge order is unprecedented in the studying of quantum 
materials, and can be highly related to the electronic nature of kagome lattice at van Hove filling 
as in AV3Sb5 [42-46]. In contrast to the honeycomb lattice, the kagome lattice has three 
sublattices, and the kagome lattice at van Hove filling exhibits unequal predominant sublattice 
occupancy [42]. With extended Coulomb interactions considered, this sublattice interference 
mechanism will produce a chiral charge order with relative angular momentum [44]. 
Phenomenologically, a chiral charge order parameter has also been proposed to interact with 
the underlying topological band structure of this material to produce a large intrinsic anomalous 
Hall effect [28,43,44,45], which is consistent with the transport data. Another anomalous 
feature of the chiral charge order is that it can carry orbital currents [28,43,44,46], analogous to 
the fundamental Haldane model [47] and Varma model [48]. A tantalizing visualization of the 
orbital magnetism is recently reported by muon spin spectroscopy, and a spontaneous internal 
magnetic field is observed just below the charge ordering temperature [49].  
 
Finally, we explore the superconducting tunneling spectrum at 0.4K, well below the 
superconducting transition temperature. Consistent with previous reports [30,32,33], the 
tunneling spectrums show an energy gap with a gap size 2Δ=0.85meV determined by the 
coherence peak-to-peak distance [Fig. 5(a)(b)]. Accordingly, we obtain the superconductivity 
coupling strength 2Δ/kBTC=3.9, which is slightly larger than the standard BCS value and 
suggests the electron pairing is close to a moderate coupling. By applying a 50mT magnetic 
field along the c-axis, we observe a zero-energy vortex core state [Fig. 5(c)(d)]. The formation 
of a clear vortex core bound state implies that the superconducting state is in the clean-limit, 
where the electron mean free path is much longer than the superconducting coherent length. 
One notable observation in the superconducting state is that the gap is shallow, and the 
measured gap is filled with substantial states. The origin of the in-gap states deserves future 
attention with lower temperature and higher energy resolution measurements. If such states are 
intrinsic and robust, then it is worthy of discussing further their relationship with the tantalizing 
broken-symmetry [32][49] of the superconducting state.
