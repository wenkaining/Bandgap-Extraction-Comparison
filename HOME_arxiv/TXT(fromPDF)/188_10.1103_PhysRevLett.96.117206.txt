The intermediate valence compound YbAl3 exhibits a broad magnetic excitation in the 
inelastic neutron scattering spectrum with characteristic energy E1 ª 50 meV, equal to the 
Kondo energy (TK ~ 600-700 K).  In the low temperature (T < Tcoh ~ 40 K) Fermi liquid 
state, however, a new peak in the scattering occurs at E2 ≈ 33 meV, which lies in the 
hybridization gap that exists in this compound.  We show, using inelastic neutron 
scattering on a single-crystal sample, that while the scattering at energies near E1 has the 
momentum (Q-) dependence expected for interband scattering across the indirect gap, the 
scattering near E2 is independent of Q over a large fraction of the Brillouin zone.  A 
possible explanation is that the peak at E2 arises from a spatially-localized excitation in 
the hybridization gap.

The Anderson Lattice,1,2 in which a small (~ 10-30 meV) semiconducting gap 
arises from hybridization of the 4f electrons with the conduction electrons (Fig. 1f), is 
believed to capture the essence of the physics of intermediate valence compounds.  When 
the Fermi level is in the gap, the behavior is that of the Kondo insulators such as YbB12 
and SmB6.  The most direct experimental evidence for the gap comes from measurements 
of the optical conductivity.  For example, for YbB12 the low temperature conductivity 
vanishes below 25 meV, and then rises to a maximum in the mid-IR near 0.25 eV.3   
The experimental neutron scattering spectra of the Kondo insulators also show low 
temperature features whose energy scale is that of the gap.  The intensity of these features 
is highly Q-dependent, peaking at the (1/2,1/2,1/2) zone boundary point in YbB12
4 and 
SmB6.5    
 
When the Fermi level is not in the gap, the behavior is that of an intermediate 
valence metal.  The cubic (Cu3Au structure) compound YbAl3 exhibits strong 
intermediate valence (z = 2.75) and a large Kondo temperature (TK ~ 600-700 K).  Below 
the "coherence temperature" Tcoh ~ 40 K, where the resistivity exhibits the T2 behavior 
expected for a Fermi liquid,6 the optical conductivity exhibits7 a narrow Drude resonance 
separated by a deep minimum at 30 meV from a mid-infrared peak at 0.25 eV.  It is 
believed that the minimum and the mid-IR peak arise from the (vertical) interband 
transitions across the hybridization gap, while the Drude resonance arises from intraband 
transitions across the Fermi level, which lies in a region of high density of states near the 
zone boundary.  Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments8 in polycrystalline 
samples of YbAl3 have shown that for T > 40 K the magnetic scattering is broad with a 
characteristic energy of order E1 ≈ 50 meV, corresponding to the Kondo temperature, but3
at low temperature an additional narrow peak occurs in the INS near E2 = 33 meV.  This 
is the same energy as the minimum in the optical conductivity, i.e it occurs on the same 
scale as the hybridization gap.  This peak broadens and weakens on alloying with a small 
concentration of Lu9 which fact, taken together with the disappearance of the peak above 
40 K, means it is a property of the fully coherent ground state.  The characterization of 
this scattering and the relationship of the behavior to that seen in the Kondo insulators is 
an important goal. 
 
To explore the physics of this scattering, and in particular to determine the Q-
dependence, we have performed inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single 
crystals of YbAl3.  The crystals were grown by precipitation from excess aluminum (self-
flux method).  One set of experiments were performed at 6 K and 100 K on the MAPS 
time-of-flight spectrometer at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility of the 
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  The initial energy was Ei = 120 meV.  Four crystals, of 
total mass ~5 g, were mounted on an aluminum sample holder and co-aligned with a 
mosaic of 2.5º.  We set ki (the incoming beam wavevector) initially parallel to the [1,0,0] 
direction; in a second set of measurements we chose ki // [1,1,0].  MAPS employs a large 
pixellated detector where each individual pixel element detects neutrons on a trajectory 
through reciprocal space parameterised by the incident energy, Ei, the angles q and f 
between the incident ki, and final wavevector kf and the time-of-flight or energy transfer 
DE. The amalgamation of these simultaneous individual trajectories results in a 3D 
hypersurface in the 4D reciprocal space of Q and DE.  Unlike the case of a triple-axis 
spectrometer where the crystal is rotated to construct a scan over energy transfer with Q =4
(2p/a0) (h,k l) held constant, for MAPS, where the crystal orientation is fixed during the 
scan, only three of the four variables h, k, l and DE are independent in any plot at fixed Ei. 
 
In Fig. 1 we plot the scattering at T = 6 K as a function of energy transfer at 
different momentum transfers.  In agreement with the earlier results reported for 
polycrystals,8,9 the scattering shows two features: a peak centered at E2 = 33 meV, whose 
width is essentially equal to the instrumental resolution, and a broad feature centered near 
E1 = 50 meV.  In Figs. 1a-d, both h and k vary, with h + k constant, as DE varies; in Fig. 
1e, only h varies with DE.  The values of (h,k,l) given in the figure correspond to the 
values at E1 and at E2.  The scattering near E1 shows considerable variation of intensity 
and lineshape with Q, but the peak near E2 does not vary much with Q.   Since YbAl3 has 
the Cu3Au crystal structure (with a0 = 4.203 Å), the Brillouin zone (BZ) is a simple cube 
centered at G and extending ±0.5 in reduced (h,k l) units in all three directions.  Hence, 
Fig. 1 shows the E2 peak at key positions in the BZ, including the G point (Fig. 1a), 
various zone boundary points (Figs. 1b, d and e) and a point in the middle of the BZ (Fig. 
1c).  Plots at other positions in the BZ are very similar.  The variation in the position and 
the magnitude of this peak is small, suggesting that the peak at E2 is essentially 
independent of Q.  
 
Fig. 2a shows an intensity map for the projection onto the k-l plane for an interval 
of energy transfer E1 ± 5 meV.  In this plot, the reduced wavevector h varies with k and l, 
e.g. for l = 0 it varies from 1.2 at k = 0  to 1.4 at k  = 1.5.  The cubic symmetry is readily 
apparent in this plot.  Peaks are observed near (h,0.5,0.5) where h(DE = E1) = 1.2.  These 
peaks lie essentially at the zone boundary close to the [0,1,1] direction.  Fig. 2b shows an 
intensity plot in the DE-Qk plane for -0.2 < l < 0.2.  For 28 < DE < 38 meV, h varies from5
0.85 at k = 0 to 1.05 at k = 1.5, crossing the zone boundary at k = 0.5 and 1.5.  This 
scattering for DE = E2 ± 5 meV is basically independent of Qk.   
 
 Preliminary work (not shown here) on the PHAROS time-of-flight spectrometer 
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) showed that the magnetic 
scattering in Figs.1 and 2 overlaps with phonon scattering.  To determine each 
contribution requires larger momentum transfer than is available on MAPS.  To this end, 
we have measured the spectra on the HB3 triple-axis spectrometer at the High Flux 
Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Six flux-grown crystals, each 
approximately 1 g, were coaligned to within ±0.3º with the [1,-1,0] direction vertical.  We 
measured the spectra at 10 and 100 K, using a fixed final energy of 14.7 meV and a 
collimation 30'-40'-80'-240'.  The counting rate is normalized to monitor count units (1 
mcu ≈ 1 sec).  For each value of Q1 = (2p/a0) (h,k l) we measured the 10 K spectra at a 
second momentum transfer Q2 = (2p/a0) (h,k l+2)  that is equivalent to Q1 in the reduced 
zone scheme and has a similar structure factor, and then fit the data as the sum of a 
magnetic contribution M(E) that varies with Q as the 4f form factor, a phonon 
contribution Ph(E) that scales as Q2 and a constant background, measured in energy gain.  
An example is shown in Fig. 3a and b, where it can be seen that the phonon contribution 
is small at low Q, as expected.  As a check on our procedure, we subtracted Ph(E) (scaled 
by the Boson temperature factor) from the data at 100 K, finding that the resulting 
magnetic contribution M at 100 K has the form shown in Fig. 3c, independent of 
(reduced) Q.   This spectrum is very similar to that seen in polycrystals8 at 100 K; the 
sharp feature at E2 disappears above 40 K.  The Q-independence suggests that the spin 
dynamics for T > Tcoh is that of incoherent Kondo scattering.6
 
Fig. 4 shows the magnetic contribution M at 10 K with the 4f form factor divided 
out in order to represent the scattering in the reduced zone.  The scattering is essentially 
identical at zone center, and at the (0,0,1/2) and (1/2,1/2,0) zone boundary points.  This 
confirms our time-of-flight result that the 30 meV scattering is largely Q-independent.  
We note, however, that the scattering at the (1/2,1/2,1/2) zone boundary point is 
considerably weaker.  This effect can also be seen in the time-of-flight data in plots (not 
shown here) similar to Fig. 2, so we believe it is a real effect. 
 
As seen in Figs. 1, 2 and 4, our basic result is that the scattering near E1 = 50 meV 
is highly Q-dependent, with peaks at the (1/2,1/2,0) zone boundary, but apart from the 
variation with the 4f form factor, the scattering near E2 = 33 meV appears to be 
independent of Q over an appreciable fraction of the Brillouin zone.   
 
The neutron scattering intensity is proportional to  
 ∫ Ni(Âq) f(Âq) Nf(Âq-Q) f(Âq-Q) dÂq  
where Âq-Q - Âq = DE is the energy transfer, Q is the momentum transfer,  f is the Fermi 
function and Ni and Nf are the initial and final densities of states.  In calculations1,2 of the 
interband transitions in the renormalized band structure (Fig. 1f) of the Anderson lattice, 
such scattering is highly Q-dependent.  The most intense scattering occurs when the 
energy transfer DE equals the threshold for indirect transitions between the regions of 
large density of states at the zone center and zone boundary of the upper and lower bands 
respectively.  This occurs when Q = qBZ (Fig. 1f). At smaller Q, the scattering is weaker 
and occurs at higher energy.  When the Fermi level does not lie in the gap, so that the 
behavior is that of an intermediate valence (IV) metal, the interband transitions still 
occur, and show a very similar Q-dependence to that of the Kondo insulators (See Fig. 57
of Ref. 1).  In addition, low energy intraband scattering across the Fermi surface is 
expected; this is related to the Drude scattering in the optical conductivity.  The 
characteristic energy for such scattering varies linearly with Q, as expected on general 
grounds for a Fermi liquid.   
 
Sharp excitations at low temperatures, whose energy scale is that of the 
hybridization gap, have been observed at low temperatures in the Kondo insulators 
SmB6,
5
  YbB12
4 and TmSe.10  These excitations are highly Q-dependent.  For example, in 
TmSe the intensity is at least a factor of four smaller at zone center than at the zone 
boundary, and in YbB12 and SmB6 the intensity is largest at the zone boundary along the 
[1,1,1] direction, decreasing dramatically as Q increases or as the angle of Q with respect 
to the [1,1,1] direction changes.  The scattering thus has the behavior expected for 
threshold scattering at the zone boundary.   
 
In YbAl3, the fact that the scattering near E1 = 50meV shows considerable Q-
dependence, peaking at the (1/2,1/2,0) zone boundary point, is consistent with interband 
scattering across an indirect gap of order 50 meV.  We note that this is also the Kondo 
scale for this compound; if so, the high temperature Kondo scattering evolves into 
interband scattering with the same energy scale.   
 
However, the E2 peak shows little variation in intensity for different values of Q 
that include the zone center, key zone boundary points and points in the center of the 
reduced zone (Figs. 1 and 4); and in addition the scattering is weaker at the (1/2,1/2,1/2) 
point (Fig. 4).  Hence this excitation differs in very important respects from those seen in 
the Kondo insulators.  It clearly does not have the Q-dependence expected for threshold 
interband scattering, unless the actual renormalized band structure is very different from8
that shown in Fig. 1f. This excitation occurs at too large an energy, and lacks the exp-
ected Q-dependence, to arise from intraband Fermi surface scattering.  Since the 
amplitude of this peak is strongly diminished at 100K, it cannot represent a crystal field 
transition; and, indeed, well-defined crystal field excitations are not expected in 
intermediate valence systems with such large Kondo temperatures.     
 
An important possibility is that the scattering represents a spatially localized 
excitation.  As mentioned above, the energy of the excitation coincides with the deep 
minimum in the optical conductivity; this suggests that the localized excitation lies inside 
the hybridization gap, thus having the character of an exciton.    Riseborough11 showed 
how a magnetic bound state, whose energy lies below the interband threshold, can arise 
in the Kondo insulators due to RKKY interactions that are enhanced by the proximity of 
the f-level to the Fermi surface.  Such a bound state, however, should be large for zone-
boundary Q, dispersing and losing amplitude rapidly as Q decreases.  Brandow2 
postulated the existence of a localized excitation in the form of an onsite valence 
fluctuation from the hybridized state into the unhybridized trivalent (4f13) state.  He 
showed that if such an elementary excitation, which unbinds or unscreens a local moment 
at an arbitrary lattice site, is included in a consistent manner with the usual excited states 
of the Anderson lattice, a two-peak structure of the susceptibility and specific heat should 
occur, similar to the low temperature anomalies observed6 experimentally in YbAl3.  In 
his treatment, however, the excitation was not derived from the Anderson lattice 
Hamiltonian but was included in an ad hoc manner.  It is thus open question whether and 
how such an excitation can arise in the context of the Anderson lattice.  It is also unclear 
why a local excitation should be so sensitive to alloy disorder. 99

Fig. 1 a-e) The scattering intensity at T = 6 K in YbAl3 versus energy transfer at various 
momentum transfers, measured on MAPS using an initial energy of 120meV.  The 
reduced wavevectors given in each panel correspond to the values at E1 = 50 meV and E2 
= 33 meV.  Fig. 1f shows a schematic plot of the renormalized band structure expected 
for the Anderson lattice, with a hybridization gap.  For IV Fermi liquids (FL), the Fermi 
level lies in the high density of states region of the lower band; for Kondo insulators (KI), 
it falls in the gap.  A typical interband transition, with energy transfer DE and momentum 
transfer Q, is shown.11
