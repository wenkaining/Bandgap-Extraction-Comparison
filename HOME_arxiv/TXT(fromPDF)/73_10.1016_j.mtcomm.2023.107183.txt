Abstract: The biphenylene network (BPN) is notable in recent fabrication efforts to design new
2D materials. The stability of its boron nitride counterpart, BN-BPN, has been confirmed through
numerical investigations. In this study, we conducted a density functional theory (DFT) analysis to
examine the mechanical, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of two other group-III
counterparts of BPN: gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). Our findings
reveal that the band gap values for BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN are 2.3 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively,
at the HSE06 level. Phonon- and energy-formation calculations and ab initio molecular dynam-
ics (AIMD) simulations suggest that BPN-(Al,Ga)N has good structural and dynamic stabilities.
BPN-GaN displayed negative phonon frequencies. However, results from AIMD simulations point
to its structural integrity with no bond reconstructions at 1000 K. These materials exhibit note-
worthy UV activity, promising prospects as UV collectors. The thermodynamic properties reveal
that the heat capacity of both BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN increases with temperature, eventually
reaching the Dulong-Petit limit at around 800 K. We also performed calculations to determine
the electron- and hole-effective masses, charge carrier mobility, elastic stiffness constants, Young’s
modulus, and Poisson ratio for both BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN, providing valuable insight into their
electronic and mechanical properties.

Introduction
The rapid advancement of nanoelectronics has spurred the exploration of novel materials with
unique properties to meet the evolving demands of high-performance electronic devices [1, 2].
In this context, free-standing 2D hexagonal aluminum nitride (AlN) and gallium nitride (GaN)
monolayers [3, 4] have reemerged as promising candidates, drawing inspiration from the advent of
graphene [5]. They share a hexagonal lattice structure with graphene and offer distinct features
and exciting prospects for various optoelectronic applications [6]. One of the critical distinctions
lies in the semiconducting band gap properties displayed by AlN and GaN monolayers, making
them highly attractive for these applications [7]. Their wide band gap enables efficient control of
charge carriers, rendering them suitable for applications such as transistors [8] and light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) [9].
On the contrary, the zero bandgap of graphene limits its usage in devices
requiring distinct on/off switching behavior [10].
The electronic properties of AlN and GaN monolayers arise from their unique atomic con-
stituents, which include aluminum and gallium atoms.
These elements exhibit distinct energy
levels and bonding characteristics compared to carbon atoms found in graphene [7]. As a result,
AlN and GaN monolayers display diverse band gap energies and optical properties, giving rise to
distinctive absorption and emission spectra that differ from those of graphene [6, 11]. Beyond their

electronic characteristics, AlN and GaN monolayers demonstrate exceptional thermal stability and
mechanical properties, making them suitable for deployment in high-temperature environments and
high-performance devices [12, 13]. Their robustness and durability make them ideal for electronic
applications that require resistance to extreme conditions [14].
One prominent application of these materials lies in optoelectronics, specifically in developing
LEDs [15, 16].
GaN-based LEDs have significantly impacted the lighting industry by provid-
ing long-lasting energy-efficient alternatives to conventional incandescent and fluorescent lighting
sources [17]. Group-III nitrides, including AlN and GaN, are also useful in laser diodes [18], power
electronic devices [19, 20], and sensors [21]. The versatility and wide-ranging applications of AlN
and GaN monolayers highlight their significance in driving technological advances in various fields,
particularly in optoelectronics and solid-state lighting [19]. Ongoing research and development
efforts continue to explore novel materials synthesis techniques and device architectures to unlock
their full potential in the ever-evolving landscape of advanced materials and electronic devices [22].
In recent in-silico studies, a series of 2D materials based on group-III elements have emerged as
promising candidates [23, 24]. These materials share a comparable structure with certain carbon-
based monolayers that have already been successfully synthesized [25–27]. One notable example is
the boron nitride form of the biphenylene network (BPN) [27], known as BN-BPN [28–31], which
has been proposed and its stability confirmed in several numerical studies based on distinct com-
putational protocols. However, to fully comprehend the potential of this specific lattice topology
and explore its practical applications, it is crucial to characterize other group-III counterparts of
BPN. By investigating these counterparts, we can expand our understanding of their properties
and identify potential applications for these materials.
Using computational approaches for material design has become essential in research for several
compelling reasons.
Usually, theoretical predictions of new nanostructured materials preceded
their synthesis by years or decades. Categorical examples are the BPN and the 2D monolayer
of C60, which had the first theoretical works published by Mortazavi in 2017 [32], and Tomanek
in 1990 [33], respectively.
Simulating and predicting material properties can be performed by
employing computational models, allowing virtual experiments and expediting the discovery and
development of new materials.
Computational techniques enable researchers to delve into the
underlying physics and chemistry of materials, providing insights into their atomic-scale structures,
electronic properties, and interactions. This deep understanding helps to elucidate the fundamental
mechanisms that govern the behavior of materials and guides the design of materials with tailored
properties.
In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the me-
chanical, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of two additional group-III counter-
parts of BPN: gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). We gain valuable
insights into these intriguing materials’ electronic and structural features using our computational
approach. One crucial aspect that we focused on was their structural stability. Interestingly, the
BPN topology has proven suitable for designing stable group-III nitride materials.

Methodology
The CASTEP [34] code was used to perform DFT simulations, investigating the mechanical, elec-
tronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN (refer to Figure 1). In
these simulations, the exchange and correlation functions were treated using the generalized gradi-
ent approximation (GGA), parameterized by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [35], as
well as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional [36]. To accurately account for the
interactions between the nuclear electrons of each atomic species, we employed norm-conserving

pseudopotentials (as implemented in CASTEP) designed explicitly for gallium, aluminum, and
nitrogen.

The unit cells are highlighted by rectangles defined by lattice vectors a and b. Green, pink, and
blue represent gallium, aluminum, and nitrogen atoms.
For achieving electronic self-consistency, we employed the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon
(BFGS) unrestricted nonlinear iterative algorithm [37, 38]. The plane-wave basis set had an energy
cutoff of 700 eV, and we set the convergence criteria for the energy at 1.0 ×10−5 eV. To fully relax
the BPN-(Ga, Al)N lattices, we used periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that the residual
force on each atom was less than 1.0 ×10−3 eV/˚A and the pressure was below 0.01 GPa. During
the lattice optimization, the basis vector along the z-direction was held fixed, and we employed a
k-grid of 10 × 10 × 1, while for electronic and optical calculations, we used a k-grid of 15 × 15 × 1
and 5 × 5 × 1 for the GGA/PBE and HSE06 methods, respectively. The partial density of states
(PDOS) was calculated at the HSE06 level using a k-grid of 20 × 20 × 1. The elastic properties
were calculated using the LDA/CA-PZ method [39, 40]. A vacuum region of 20 ˚A was considered
to avoid spurious interactions among periodic images.
The decision to employ a smaller k-grid resolution in our HSE06 calculations, in contrast to
the k-grid used in the GGA/PBE method, is primarily driven by computational considerations,
specifically the substantial computational cost associated with the HSE06 method. HSE06-based
calculations involve significant computational time, which can limit the feasibility of employing a
finer k-grid. We performed convergence tests to validate the suitability of the selected k-grid reso-
lution for our HSE06 calculations. Our convergence tests verified that the chosen k-grid resolution
maintains the required accuracy and reliability of the results within an acceptable margin of error.
For the phonon calculations, we utilized the linear response method with a grid spacing of
0.05 1/˚A and a convergence tolerance of 10−5 eV/˚A2. To assess the mechanical properties of the
BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices, we employed the stress–strain method based on the Voigt–Reuss–Hill ap-
proximation [41, 42]. This method follows Hooker’s law, establishing a linear relationship between
the Lagrangian strain and the Cauchy stress tensor.
We applied an external electric field of 1.0 V/˚A along the x and y directions to investigate the
optical properties. Using the complex dielectric constant ϵ = ϵ1+iϵ2, where ϵ1 and ϵ2 represent the
real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, respectively, we directly obtained the optical
quantities. To calculate the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, we employed Fermi’s golden
rule, which considers interband optical transitions between the valence (VB) and conduction bands
(CB), where

In the context of optical properties, various parameters play a role. These include the photon
frequency (ω), the unit cell volume (VΩ), the k-point weight (Wk) in reciprocal space, and the
dipole transition matrix element (ρij). The relationship between the real (ϵ1) and imaginary (ϵ2)
parts of the dielectric constant is established through the Kramers-Kronig relation [43]. Specifically,
the real part of the dielectric constant can be expressed as:

where P is the Cauchy principal value.
Additional coefficients can be derived once the dielectric constant’s real and imaginary parts are
obtained to characterize the optical properties further. These coefficients include the absorption
coefficient (α), the optical conductivity (σ), and the reflectivity (R). Their calculation involves
using P and can be expressed as follows:

To understand the thermal effect on the BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices, we used CASTEP to calculate
thermodynamic properties, enthalpy H(T), free energy F(T), entropy S(T), and temperature times
the entropy term S(T) = U −F, where U is the internal energy of the system and the heat capacity
of the materials CV (T) as a function of temperature. The equations below are based on work by

Results
We first present the lattice arrangement of the optimized BPN-(Ga,Al)N sheets, as depicted in
Figure 1. As expected, the GGA/PBE and HSE06 methods yield comparable optimized parameters
for these lattices. Therefore, in this regard, we focus on the results obtained using the HSE06
method, showcasing Figure 1 and Table 1. Figure 1 shows the slight distortion of the four- and
eight-membered rings in the BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices compared to the all-carbon BPN structure
[31, 45] while maintaining a planar configuration. These lattices possess an orthorhombic crystal
structure and fall under the PMMA space group (D2H-5). The a and b lattice vectors are 9.71 ˚A
and 5.79 ˚A for BPN-GaN and 9.61 ˚A and 5.62 ˚A for BPN-AlN.

To assess the dynamical stability of the BPN-(Ga,Al)N sheets, we calculated their formation en-
ergies and the phonon dispersion relations along the high symmetry directions using the GGA/PBE
method, as depicted in Figure 2. We found formation energy values of -5.89 eV and -4.82 eV for
BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN structures, respectively.
Phonon dispersion analysis of the unstrained BPN-GaN sheet (see Figure 2 (a)) revealed the
presence of imaginary frequencies, specifically soft longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes
[46, 47]. Generally, this trend indicates inherent instability. On the contrary, the phonon dispersion
diagram shown in Figure 2(b) consists exclusively of real frequencies, indicating the dynamic
stability of the BPN-AlN sheets. The absence of a band gap between the acoustic and optical
modes suggests a high scattering process rate and a short phonon lifetime, contributing to this
material’s relatively low lattice thermal conductivity.
The presence of imaginary frequencies in the BPN-GaN lattice indicates its susceptibility to
structural distortions, emphasizing the significance of this observation. Such distortions may arise
from inadequate bonding interactions within the material or even intrinsic stress. These instabilities
can have adverse consequences, including phonon scattering, diminished thermal conductivity,
and even structural deformations. The subsequent AIMD results below provide information on
structural deformations of the BPN-GaN lattice.
One way to assess the thermal stability of a material using AIMD simulations is by monitoring
the total energy per atom throughout the simulation. In a thermally stable system, the total energy
per atom should remain relatively constant, indicating a balanced energy distribution within the

material. Fluctuations in the total energy per atom during the simulation can provide insights into
the material’s response to thermal perturbations.
To ensure the dynamical stabilities of BPN-(Ga,Al)N, we conducted 5 ps of AIMD simulations
at 1000K using the GGA/PBE approach, as depicted in Figure 3. The insets in the figure provide
a top and side view of the AIMD snapshot, showcasing the lattices in their final stages during the
simulations. A 3×3×1 supercell comprising 108 atoms was used. This period and system size are
usually employed to investigate the system stability in AIMD simulations [48]. Observing both
cases, one can see that the total energy per atom exhibits a flat pattern. The inset in Figure
3(a) presents the MD snapshot (side view) of BPN-GaN at 5 ps, revealing some lattice distortions
imposed by the temperature. However, the top view illustrates that no bond reconstructions occur
concerning the optimized lattice in Figure 1. Analogously, Figure 3 (b) demonstrates that BPN-
AlN maintains its planarity without any bond reconstructions. These observations suggest that
both structures exhibit good thermal stability.

When a structure’s formation energy lies on the convex hull, it is considered thermodynamically
stable and experimentally viable. Examining the formation energy plot versus N concentrations
(refer to Figure 4), we have identified a global minimum structure in this 2D space. This minimum
occurs precisely at the midpoint, with N:(Ga,Al) = 1:1 composition, resembling a structure closely
akin to all-carbon BPN.

We now delve into the band structure characteristics of BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices. The upper
panels of Figure 5 present the band structure profiles obtained using the GGA/PBE (black) and
HSE06 (blue) methods.
In the case of BPN-GaN (see Figure 5(a)), the band gap is indirect
(from X-point to G-point) and measures 1.86 and 2.31 eV at the GGA/PBE and HSE06 levels,
respectively. For BPN-AlN, the indirect band gap values from the X-point to the G-point are
2.32 eV and 3.18 eV according to the GGA/PBE and HSE06 calculations, respectively (see Figure
5(b)).
Generally, GGA/PBE calculations underestimate band gaps [49]. Therefore, the hybrid func-
tional HSE06 was used to obtain this work’s electronic and optical properties precisely. The band
structures of both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials, as obtained from GGA/PBE, exhibit wide semicon-
ducting band gaps, which are useful in optoelectronics and high-power devices [50]. On the other
hand, the HSE06 calculation suggests that BPN-AlN behaves as an insulator. These band struc-
tures are characterized by energy bands near the Fermi level that exhibit dispersion, indicating
the delocalized nature of electronic states within these materials.
The difference in predicting the band gap values for BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN arises from these
computational methods’ inherent limitations and approximations. The HSE06 method, being a
hybrid functional, incorporates a fraction of exact exchange in addition to the exchange-correlation
functional. Including non-local exchange interactions tend to yield more accurate electronic struc-
ture predictions, especially for systems with significant electron localization or delocalization, like
semiconductors. As such, the band gap calculated using HSE06 is often considered to provide a
more reliable representation of electronic properties. In contrast, the PBE method relies on the
generalized gradient approximation.
For BPN-AlN, the hole (m∗
h) and electron (m∗
e) effective masses are 0.250m0 and 0.085m0, re-
spectively. For BPN-GaN, m∗
h and m∗
e are 0.875m0 and 0.038m0, respectively. m0 is the electron
mass. Generally, a lower effective mass correlates with higher carrier mobility, as carriers experi-
ence less resistance while moving in the crystal lattice. These values suggest that BPN-AlN could
be particularly suitable for applications requiring efficient hole transport, such as p-type transistor
channels or hole-dominant charge transport layers in photodetectors or solar cells. In contrast,
BPN-GaN, with its higher hole effective mass and lower electron effective mass, is anticipated to
have higher electron mobility, when contrasted with BPN-AlN, could be advantageous for appli-
cations that prioritize electron transport, such as n-type transistor channels or electron-dominant
charge transport layers in optoelectronic devices. Remarkably, the m∗
e values of BPN-(Al,Ga)N are
lower than those for the typical wz-AlN and wz-GaN structures (0.22m0 and 0.25m0 [51], respec-

tively). This feature reinforces that BPN-(Al,Ga)N systems hold greater promise for applications
demanding enhanced electronic transport efficiency than their wurtzite analogs.
We determined the full valence-band (VB) and conduction-band (CB) bandwidths for BPN-
(Al,Ga)N systems. The VB and CB values for BPN-GaN are 17.76 eV and 25.70 eV, respectively.
The VB and CB values for BPN-AlN are 16.29 eV and 21.94 eV, respectively. The bandwidth
establishes a range of energy values over which electrons can exist within a particular band. It also
captures the extent of energy values within which electrons can occupy states, thereby influencing
their kinetic behavior and mobility. A wider energy bandwidth typically corresponds to a broader
range of electron energies, which can impact various electronic phenomena, including conductivity,
carrier mobility, and optical transitions. For instance, the VB values for common AlN and GaN

monolayers are about 15.80 eV [52].
The partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN, using the HSE06
hybrid functional, is shown in the left and right bottom panels of Figure 5, respectively. As a
general trend, results indicate a significant predominance of p-states for both materials. In these
cases, electronic transitions and interactions will primarily involve the participation of p-orbitals.
These orbitals are typically associated with directional bonding. They are characterized by lobes
with a dumbbell-like shape, enabling them to interact with neighboring atoms or orbitals in a
controlled manner.
Figures 5(b,e) provide a comprehensive view of the total contributions of s, p, d, and f orbitals
for both atomic species within each lattice. Figures 5(c,f) illustrate the PDOS per atomic species.
The p-states play a dominant role. In the case of BPN-GaN, Ga-p orbitals contribute significantly,
followed closely by N-p states. Additionally, Ga-s orbitals primarily participate in forming the
conduction band. For BPN-AlN, N-p orbitals have a higher contribution, with Al-p states following
suit. Similarly, Al-s orbitals play a crucial role in shaping the conduction band.
Regarding the p-state properties, the behavior of p-states in a material holds crucial implications
for its electronic, optical, and transport properties. A material’s p-states can influence phenomena
such as energy band gaps, absorption and emission of light, and charge mobility. For instance,
the nature of p-states can determine the type of electronic transitions that occur, affecting the
material’s optical characteristics.
Materials with well-defined p-states often exhibit interesting
optoelectronic properties, making them suitable candidates for applications like photovoltaics,
light-emitting diodes, and sensors. Furthermore, the interaction of p-states with neighboring atoms
or external fields can influence charge transport mechanisms, affecting the material’s performance
in electronic devices.

Here, it is worth comparing the BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN band structures with conventional AlN
and GaN having wurtzite (wz) and zincblende (zb) structures [53]. Table 2 presents the theoretical
band gap (Eg) using the HSE06+G0W0 approach and corresponding experimental (Exp) band
gaps for (wz,zb)-GaN and (wz,zb)-AlN structures reported in the literature [54].
Notably, the
BNP-AlN band gap significantly differs from those observed in (wz,zb)-AlN. While BPN-AlN acts
as a wide-bandgap semiconductor (wz,zb)-AlN is an insulator. The band structure characteristics
of BPN-AlN discussed above make it particularly suitable for emerging optoelectronic applications,
such as high-frequency switching devices [55], light-emitting diodes [56], and RF power amplifiers
[57]. BPN-GaN displays similar band gap values to those reported for (wz,zb)-GaN. These materials
also fall within the wide-bandgap semiconductors category, demonstrating the interesting potential
for the aforementioned applications.

systems. In Figure 6(a), the optical absorption (α) is shown as a function of the photon energy.
Both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials exhibit strong optical activity, primarily in the ultraviolet (UV)
region.
The refractive index (R) in Figure 6 (b) shows a prominent peak at approximately 6.0 eV for
E//(X,Y) and 5.2 eV for E//Z in the case of BPN-GaN, while BPN-AlN shows peaks around 6.4

and exhibits pronounced peaks at approximately 6.0 eV for E//(X,Z) and 6.2 eV for E//(Y) in the
case of BPN-GaN, while BPN-AlN shows a peak at around 6.5 eV for E//(X,Y,Z). These findings
suggest that BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials will likely be transparent in a solution and hold promise as
potential candidates for UV device collectors.

In Figure 6(c), the real part (Re) of the optical conductivity is shown for BPN-GaN (solid black

exhibit distinct peaks in their curves, with a BPN-GaN peak at 5.8 eV and a BPN-AlN peak at
6.1 eV. The gradual increase in the real part of optical conductivity up to 5.8 eV corresponds to
the increasing absorption coefficient within this energy range. These peaks indicate regions where
electromagnetic waves can penetrate profoundly and reflect high optical conductivity. Therefore,
targeting these specific peak energy values would be beneficial in optimizing BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices
for high optical conductivity.

in their real parts, which can be attributed to the electronic polarizability of these materials. On
the contrary, the imaginary part shows peaks at 6.0 eV, indicating electronic transitions involving
the (Ga,Al)-p character of the conduction states, as revealed by the PDOS analysis in Figure 5.
Beyond the band gap energy, the dielectric function shows a significant increase in its imaginary
part, highlighting the strong UV absorption capabilities of the materials.
To gain insights into the thermal behavior of BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices, we conducted calcula-
tions to determine their thermodynamic properties, including entropy S(T), enthalpy H(T), and
free energy F(T). We investigate the temperature dependence of the entropy term, expressed as
S(T) = U −F, where U represents the system’s internal energy. Moreover, we evaluated the heat
capacity CV (T) of the materials as a function of temperature. Figure 7 displays these calculated
thermodynamic properties, which were obtained using the GGA/PBE level of theory.
Figure 7: Thermodynamic potentials of BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices. In panel (a), the red curves show
the structure formation enthalpy H(T), the blue curves represent the free energy F(T), and the
black curves illustrate the temperature times the entropy term (T*S(T)). In panel (b), the heat
capacity as a function of the temperature (CV (T)) is shown in black and red for BPN-GaN and
BPN-AlN.
Entropy measures the degree of disorder within a physical system’s atomic arrangements. Fig-
ure 7 illustrates the temperature-dependent behavior of T*S(T) in BPN-(Ga,Al)N lattices. At
extremely low temperatures (below 100 K), the entropy value tends to zero, indicating a highly
organized lattice structure with restricted atomic mobility. However, as the temperature rises,
these monolayers exhibit increased thermal mobility, leading to a corresponding increase in the
constituent particles’ internal energy (U), including their kinetic energy. Consequently, the spac-
ing between adjacent atoms (bond distances) expands, resulting in the crystals’ thermal expansion.
This increased particle instability correlates with an increase in entropy as the temperature con-
tinues to rise (as observed in the black curves of Figure 7(a)).
Figure 7(a) also presents the temperature dependence of H(T) for the BPN-(Ga, Al) N mono-
layers. At low temperatures (below 100 K), H(T) remains constant, indicating a stable state for
both materials. However, a quadratic relationship between H and T is observed as the temperature
exceeds this critical value. Lower values of H(T) indicate a more favorable formation process, sug-
gesting the thermodynamic stability of the lattice. This feature is consistent with the observation
that higher temperatures result in higher H(T), reducing the probability of finding an energetically
stable structure, as depicted in Figure 7(a). Notably, both materials exhibit H(T) values below 6

eV for temperatures up to 1000 K.
It is essential to note the close relationship between H(T) and U in crystals. The internal
energy (U) of the system is the sum of H(T) and the product of pressure (P) and volume (V ). As
the temperature increases, the internal energy also increases. Consequently, the crystal undergoes
thermal expansion, increasing volume (V ) and pressure and volume product (P × V ). This trend,
in turn, contributes to the elevation of H(T) in BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers.
At low temperatures, lattices absorb thermal energy similarly to harmonic oscillators. However,
as the energy reaches a certain threshold, lattice anharmonicity comes into play, resulting in a
linear relationship. This behavior is observed in both systems, where the enthalpy increases with
rising temperature, although the degree of dependence may vary. The system’s internal energy
(U - T*S) is considered to understand this dependence further. Notably, the rate of increase in
T*S surpasses that of the internal energy U. Figure 7(a) depicts the temperature dependence
of F(T). The lattices maintain their structural integrity at low temperatures without inducing
anharmonicity or energy losses upon receiving additional energy. However, at high temperatures,
lattice scattering becomes prominent, introducing anharmonicity into the system.
Heat capacity plays a vital role in assessing a material’s thermal characteristics as it mea-
sures the energy absorption when the temperature increases by one Kelvin. In Figure 7(b), the
temperature-dependent behavior of the heat capacity in the BPN-(Ga, Al) N monolayers is de-
picted, revealing similarities between the two materials. BPN-AlN exhibits a slightly higher heat
capacity, suggesting a greater production of phonons at a given temperature than that of BPN-
GaN. As the temperature rises, the intrinsic monolayer heat capacity also increases due to the
greater involvement of phonons. This trend aligns with the structural dependency observed in
time-dependent enthalpy (see Figure 7(a)).
In the temperature range of 0 to 300 K, the heat capacity experiences a steep increase with
temperature, as shown in Figure 7 (b).
However, between 300 and 1000 K, the growth rate
slows down.
The heat capacity reaches a maximum limit at temperatures beyond the Debye
characteristic temperature (approximately 900 K for both materials), where all vibrations contain
the same energy. This behavior follows the Dulong-Petit law, indicating that the specific heat
capacity of the high-temperature lattice remains constant and independent of the temperature.
The temperature-dependent behavior of entropy and enthalpy sheds light on the stability and
phase transitions of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers. Constant enthalpy at low temperatures indicates
a stable state, while the quadratic relationship observed as temperatures rise indicates thermody-
namic stability. These findings have implications for the design of devices with enhanced thermal
stability and controlled phase transitions. In this sense, BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could serve
as building blocks for smart materials capable of responding to specific temperature ranges and
finding applications in thermal actuators or switches. The expansion of crystals’ bond distances
and the correlation between internal energy and enthalpy contribute to understanding thermal
expansion mechanisms. These insights are crucial for developing nanoscale devices where precise
control of thermal expansion is essential.
BPN-(Ga,Al)N structures could be integrated into nanoelectromechanical systems that require
controlled thermal expansion for optimal performance. The temperature-dependent behavior of
the heat capacity offers insights into energy absorption as temperature increases. Understanding
heat capacity can guide the design of materials for efficient energy harvesting and conversion.
BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could be employed in thermoelectric generators, converting waste heat
into usable electrical energy. The similarities and differences in heat capacity between BPN-AlN
and BPN-GaN suggest distinct phonon behaviors that affect thermal conductivity. This insight
is valuable for developing materials with tailored thermal transport properties. BPN-(Ga,Al)N
monolayers could be engineered to enhance or minimize thermal conductivity, making them suitable
for applications ranging from efficient thermal insulators to high-performance thermal conductors.

We now analyze the elastic properties of BPN-(Ga,Al)N, which play a crucial role in under-
standing microcracks behavior and materials’ overall durability. To assess the anisotropy in their
mechanical properties, we determine the Poisson’s ratio (ν(θ)) and Young’s modulus (Y (θ)) under
pressure in the xy plane, as given by the following equations [58, 59]:

The elastic constants C11, C22, C12, and C44 obtained for the BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers, pre-
sented in Table 3, satisfy the Born-Huang criteria of the orthorhombic crystal (C11C22 −C2
12 > 0
and C44 > 0) [60, 61], indicating their good mechanical stability. Additionally, Young’s modu-
lus and Poisson’s ratio of BPN-(Ga,Al)N structures were calculated using Equations 12 and 13,
respectively (see Figure 8). We found these properties exhibit anisotropic characteristics.
Regarding Young’s modulus, the calculated maximum values (YMAX) are 158.39 GPa and
114.50 GPa for BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN, respectively. These values are smaller than those of
hexagonal AlN (405.1 GPa [62]) and GaN (287.7 GPa [63]) monolayers. These differences can be
attributed to the porosity of the BPN-like structures, resulting from the presence of eight-atom
rings and the rigidity of the bonds in the four-atom rings. These factors contribute to the reduced
resilience of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers to strain compared to their hexagonal counterparts [64].

When a compressive (tensile) strain is acted in one direction, materials tend to expand (con-

tract) in the perpendicular direction, corresponding to the positive Poisson’s ratio for ordinary
materials. The opposite is for materials with a negative Poisson’s ratio (i.e. auxetic materials
[65]). In Figure 8, one can note that BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN have positive Poisson’s ratio, with
maximum values (νMAX) about 0.91 and 0.82, respectively. For these νMAX values, Young’s mod-
ulus values are less than 20 GPa, indicating the incompressibility of these materials for biaxial
strains, i.e., strains that are not applied solely along the x or y directions (uniaxial strains).
Most common materials exhibit Poisson’s ratios ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 [66]. A Poisson’s ratio
of 0.5 indicates incompressible materials that retain their lateral dimensions when subjected to
axial strain. For BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN, the minimum values of their Poisson’s ratios (νMIN)
for uniaxial strains applied along the x and y directions are 0.20 and 0.11, respectively. These values
are significantly lower than those observed in hexagonal AlN and GaN, which are approximately
0.46 and 0.44 [67], respectively.
The lower Poisson ratios of BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN can be
attributed to their BPN-like structures, which possess a degree of porosity higher than those of
their honeycomb-based lattice counterparts.
This increased porosity allows BPN structures to
undergo more deformation under tension, resulting in lower Poisson ratios.
Notably, BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN exhibit distinctive mechanical responses due to their unique
BPN-like structures. Young’s modulus values of 158.39 GPa and 114.50 GPa for BPN-AlN and
BPN-GaN are lower than those for their hexagonal counterparts [68, 69]. This deviation is at-
tributed to the porosity inherent in the BPN-like structures, which results from the presence of
eight-atom rings and the rigidity of bonds in the four-atom rings. Consequently, these structural
features influence the mechanical resilience of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers, rendering them less
resistant to strain than hexagonal AlN and GaN monolayers.
The anisotropic mechanical behavior, reflected in Young’s modulus, makes BPN-AlN and BPN-
GaN promising candidates for flexible electronics and nanomechanical devices. Their relatively
lower Young’s modulus than hexagonal counterparts suggests improved deformability and resilience
to bending or mechanical stress. This attribute is crucial in applications such as wearable elec-
tronics, sensors, and flexible displays, where mechanical adaptability is a key consideration.
The Poisson’s ratio of BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN offers an intriguing avenue for microelectrome-
chanical systems applications. The positive Poisson’s ratio indicates responsiveness to strain varia-
tions, while the lower values compared to hexagonal materials hint at unique deformability. These
attributes can be leveraged to design MEMS devices with tailored actuation and sensing capa-
bilities. Moreover, the distinctive mechanical properties of BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayers could con-
tribute to energy harvesting applications. Their good deformability under mechanical stress can
be interesting for piezoelectric energy conversion.
Based on the results presented here, the advantages of BPN-(Al,Ga)N materials over common
GaN and AlN with wurtzite and zincblende structures are twofold: I. Novel electronic properties:
BPN-based materials exhibit a unique atomic arrangement that can lead to innovative electronic
properties, holding promise for electronic and optoelectronic devices; II. Porous structure and
surface area: The BPN topology boasts a substantial surface area-to-volume ratio and a porous
composition, rendering it suitable for various surface-dependent applications, including gas capture,
sensing, and adsorption [70–72].
We must acknowledge two primary disadvantages of BPN-(Al,Ga)N materials compared to
conventional GaN and AlN structures: I. Synthesis and stabilization challenges: The synthesis
and stabilization of BPN pose challenges due to its intricate structure and potential reactivity; II.
Ongoing research and exploration: BPN remains a relatively new material, with its properties and
potential applications still actively researched.
Turning to the strengths of common AlN and GaN structures, the piezoelectric properties of wz-
AlN and wz-GaN enable the efficient conversion between electrical and mechanical energy forms.
These properties remain unexplored in BPN-based materials. Moreover, wz-GaN finds extensive

utility in LEDs [73], laser diodes [74], and other optoelectronic devices owing to its direct band
gap and high electron mobility. The zincblende structure facilitates the creation of quantum dots,
holding promise for applications in quantum computing and advanced optical devices. Nonetheless,
challenges in crystal growth persist, impacting the achievement of high-quality single crystals and
subsequently affecting device performance. The synthesis and control of zincblende structures also
present challenges, influencing device integration and overall performance.
Figure 9: Panels (a,b) illustrate the quadratic fitting curve for the BPN-(Ga,Al)N total energy
as a function of the applied compressive and tensile strains to derive the in-plane stiffness (C2D).
Panels (c,d) show the linear fitting diagram for the BPN-(Ga,Al)N total energy as a function of
the compressive and tensile strains to derive the deformation potential constant (E1).
Most of the notable properties of these materials derive from their band gap configurations.
With band gap values of 2.30 eV for BPN-AlN and 3.18 eV for BPN-GaN, these materials offer a
tunable range of band gaps, enabling tailored electronic and optical functionalities. The variation
in band gaps allows for design flexibility in different devices and applications. Moreover, BPN-AlN
and BPN-GaN exhibit wide band gaps, making them suitable for high-power and high-temperature
environments.
When contrasted with conventional AlN structures, the comparatively lower band gap of BPN-
AlN could make it suitable for developing high-efficiency light-emitting diodes, particularly in the
UV-visible spectral range. The wider BPN-GaN band gap lends itself to optoelectronic devices
operating at higher photon energies. BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN, with their wide band gap and
potential for efficient electron mobility, hold promise for high-frequency switching applications,
such as RF power amplifiers and high-speed transistors.
Leveraging their unique electronic properties, BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN can find utility in sensor
technologies, including gas sensing, biosensing, and radiation detection, where their porous lattice
structure and tailored band gaps could enhance sensitivity and selectivity. The tunable band gaps

of these materials suggest applications in photovoltaic devices, where they could facilitate efficient
light absorption and electron-hole separation.
To comprehensively understand the electronic conductance in monolayer BPN-(Ga,Al)N, we
have extended our analysis to calculate charge carrier mobility using the deformation potential
(DP) theory [75]. This approach is based on the effective mass approximation and is commonly
employed for evaluating carrier mobility in 2D layered semiconductors. Carrier mobility (µ) is
defined as
µ =

where md = pm∗xm∗y represents the average effective mass. C2D is the in-plane stiffness C2D =

investigated system, respectively. m∗
i denotes the effective mass for electrons (e) and holes (h)
according to Equation 11. E1 = dEedge/dδ, where δ is the applied strain by a step of 0.5% and
Eedge is the energy of the band edges (VBM for the holes and CBM for the electrons). VBM and
CBM stand for valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, respectively, located at G
and X points. kB, T, e, and ℏ, correspond to Boltzmann’s constant, temperature, the elementary
charge of an electron, and Planck’s constant.

mass of a free electron.
We have summarized the computed values for m∗
i , md, C2D, E1, and µ at 300 K in Table 3. By
subjecting the system to both compressive and tensile strains, we calculate E1 through linear fitting
of CBM and VBM values for electrons and holes, respectively (see Figure 9(a)). Subsequently, C2D
is determined by applying a quadratic fitting approach to the total energy data as a function of
compressive and tensile strains, as depicted in Figure 9(b).
The electron mobility surpasses the hole mobility, as indicated in Table 3. Furthermore, the
carrier mobility in the BPN-(Ga,Al)N monolayer exhibits anisotropic behavior, with notable dis-
tinctions between the x and y directions. Specifically, the carrier mobility along the x direction is
considerably higher than the y direction. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the signifi-
cantly smaller effective mass in the x direction than in the y direction.
For instance, in h-AlN lattices, the electron mobility is 0.32 and 0.295 (in units of 103 cm2V−1s−1)
in the x and y directions, respectively [76]. In contrast, the hole mobility measures 1.77 and 1.8 (in
units of 103 cm2V−1s−1) in these directions [76]. Notably, both electrons and holes in BPN-AlN
exhibit higher mobility than h-AlN. Similarly, in h-GaN lattices, the electron mobility is 0.29 and
0.30 (in units of 103 cm2V−1s−1) in the x and y directions, respectively, while the hole mobility
is 1.74 and 2.39 (in units of 103 cm2V−1s−1) in the respective directions [76]. In BPN-GaN, both
electrons and holes exhibit enhanced mobility compared to h-GaN. The superior charge carrier
mobility observed in the BPN-(Ga,Al)N systems compared to h-(Ga,Al)N can be attributed to
their distinct topologies.

Conclusions
In summary, we performed DFT calculations to study the mechanical, electronic, thermodynamic,
and optical properties of two group-III counterparts of the recently synthesized biphenylene network
(BPN): gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride (BPN-AlN). We calculated formation
energies and phonon dispersion relations along the high symmetry directions to assess their dynam-
ical stabilities. Moreover, AIMD simulations were performed to describe their dynamical stability
at 1000 K.
The phonon dispersion profile of the BPN-GaN sheet revealed the presence of imaginary fre-
quencies. Conversely, the phonon dispersion diagram of the BPN-AlN monolayer exclusively con-
sists of real frequencies, indicating its dynamic stability.
The final AIMD snapshot of BPN-
(Al,Ga)N revealed lattice distortions.
However, no bond reconstructions occur concerning the
initially optimized lattices. These observations suggest that both structures exhibit good thermal
stability.
In the case of BPN-GaN, the band gap is indirect and measures 2.31 eV and 1.86 eV at
the HSE06 and GGA/PBE levels, respectively. For BPN-AlN, the indirect bandgap values are
2.32 eV and 3.18 eV, according to GGA/PBE and HSE06 calculations, respectively. The band
structures of both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials exhibit wide semiconducting band gaps, which find
applications in optoelectronics and high-power devices. On the other hand, the HSE06 calculation
suggests that BPN-AlN behaves as an insulator. The optical properties analysis demonstrated
strong optical activity in the ultraviolet region for both BPN-(Ga,Al)N materials, making them
potential candidates for UV device collectors.
