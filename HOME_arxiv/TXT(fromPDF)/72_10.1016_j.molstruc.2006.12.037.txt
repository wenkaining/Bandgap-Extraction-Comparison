Abstract
Using a semiclassical continuum model of an electron in a deformable molecular
crystal, some properties of multicomponent generalizations of the polaron–“vector
polarons”– are elucidated. Analytical solutions for the case of two electronic bands
coupled to two vibrational modes are given in detail. Within the model considered,
the vector polaron can be classiﬁed by its wavefunction into several types and can
have features that include: (1) a spatial variation in the electronic and vibrational
character, and (2) low-energy internal degrees of freedom. For the case of electronic
and vibrational degeneracy, local Jahn-Teller interactions can also lead to a novel
spatiotemporal soliton, a long-lived excited state of the many-electron system sta-
bilized by the conservation law resulting from degeneracy.

Introduction
Many of the complex solids currently under intensive theoretical and exper-
imental study have common attributes. High Tc superconductors, fullerene-
based materials, and colossal magnetoresistive manganites all feature elec-
tronic and vibrational degeneracies that are a consequence of the spatial sym-
metries of the crystal structure. These systems typically have multiple elec-
tronic and structural phases competing at low temperatures. And there is
ample evidence [1] that the electron-phonon interaction and the resulting po-
laron quasiparticles play an important role in shaping many of the physical
properties of these materials.
These observations serve as motivation for the theoretical study of the eﬀects
of generalized electron-phonon coupling in multiband systems. Using a semi-

31 August 2018classical continuum model of an electron in a deformable molecular crystal,
the eﬀects of electronic and vibrational degeneracy (and near degeneracy) on
polaron structure have been investigated. With the inclusion of local Jahn-
Teller couplings within the degenerate manifolds, a multicomponent polaron
emerges as a solution of the semiclassical equations of motion [2].
Experimentally the richer vibrational and electronic structure of this “vector
polaron” might well be probed using STM to image the charge density in the
vicinity of a vector polaron trapped at a defect. This would be similar to the
STM studies of the surface of an anisotropically gapped superconductor with
impurities [3], where the order parameter symmetry has a great eﬀect in shap-
ing spatial features of the local electron density of states in the vicinity of an
impurity, and this can be seen through measurements of the local conductivity.

The Model
Consider a molecular solid with two orbitals per molecule: |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩. The
molecule is also taken to have two vibrational modes: a breathing mode with
amplitude φ0 and a symmetry-breaking mode with amplitude φ1. The orbitals
are taken to transform under elements of the molecular point group so that
the symmetry-breaking mode couples to the diﬀerence in orbital densities, a
local E ⊗β Jahn-Teller term.
The continuum Hamiltonian for this system is taken to be
H = Hel + Hph + HJT
(1)
with
Hel =

and
HJT = −

ddxΨ† (g0φ0σ0 + g1φ1σ3) Ψ
(4)
where Ψ(x) is a two-component ﬁeld operator. The upper component destroys
an electron from the ﬁrst orbital at x, while the lower component destroys an
electron from the second orbital at x. In the absence of distortions, the band
2constructed from |ψ1⟩states is oﬀset in energy by 2∆from the band con-
structed from |ψ2⟩states. The limit ∆→0 corresponds to doubly degenerate
bands.
A continuum approximation to the local E ⊗β model studied by H¨ock et al.
[4] is recovered in the limit g0 →0, while the continuum Holstein molecular
crystal model [5] is obtained in the limit g1 →0. Hence, the model of Eq. 1
combines the Holstein model and the E ⊗β model.

Bogoliubov-de Gennes Equations
The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for this model can be found by
expanding the ﬁeld operator in terms of a new real-space basis. Envelope
functions {un, vn}∞
n=1 that modulate the molecular orbitals are introduced,
and the ﬁeld operator becomes
Ψ =
X
n
 un


cn
(5)
where cn destroys an electron with amplitudes un(x) and vn(x) for the two
molecular orbitals. A necessary condition (unitarity) on the amplitudes is then
Z
ddx(u∗
nun′ + v∗
nvn′) = δnn′
(6)
The BdG equations for the envelope functions are then found to be

un = ǫnun


2∇2 −∆−g0φ0 + g1φ1

vn = ǫnvn
(7)
From energy minimization, the distortions must satisfy the following self-
consistent equations

where the sums are over all occupied states.
3For a system with a single electron, only one term contributes to the sum.
Eqs. 8 can be substituted into the BdG equations to obtain the two coupled
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations for the envelope functions u, v previously ob-
tained in Ref. [2]

The single electron might also be thought of as occupying a conduction band
or partially occupying a set of conduction bands. Provided the polarization
eﬀects from the ﬁlled valence band are small, the “frozen” valence band ap-
proximation can be made, and the identical BdG equations result.

where ω2 ≡(|ǫ| −∆)/(|ǫ| + ∆) and β = η/ν.
Eqs. 11 have been previously studied in many diﬀerent contexts such as non-
linear optics (propagation of light in birefringent optical ﬁbers [6]) and atomic
physics (spinor Bose-Einstein condensation [7]) where the resulting Ginzburg-
Landau equations have the same form. Although the mathematical study of
systems of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations is still in its infancy, a
set of known solutions in 1D and 2D to these equations that describe the
components of the vector polaron wavefunction will now be summarized.

Vector Polarons in 1D
For one spatial dimension, three regimes can be identiﬁed where analytic solu-
tions to Eq. 11 that are stable and localized are known to exist. In general, it is
required that ǫ < 0 and |ǫ| < ∆. η and ν are restricted here to be non-negative.
Thus, 0 ≤β ≤1.
4.1
Manakov type
The case of β = 1 and ω = 1 is special, as it corresponds to an integrable
system. Manakov [8] studied this system of equations in another context. The
symmetry of these equations gives rise to an inﬁnite set of degenerate solutions
that can be labeled by a continuous parameter 0 ≤θ < 2π.
r1(ξ) =
√
2 cos θ sech ξ
r2(ξ) =
√
2 sin θ sech ξ
(12)
ω = 1 corresponds to exact degeneracy (∆= 0), while β = 1 results from no
coupling to the symmetry-breaking mode (g1 →0). Consequently, the energy
of the state is independent of orbital density diﬀerences. Thus the Manakov
solution contains a zero-energy internal degree of freedom, corresponding to
periodic changes in the local orbital mixing.
4.2
Equal Amplitude type
One situation that is exactly soluble is the “equal amplitude” case where
r1(ξ) = r2(ξ). For stable, localized solutions, the parameters must be further
restricted so that ω = 1. In this case, Eqs. 11 reduce to
 d2
dξ2 −1 + (1 + β)r2
!
r = 0
(13)
The solution to this scalar nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is the well-known
bell soliton
r(ξ) =
s
2
1 + β sech ξ
(14)
5The continuous symmetry present in the Manakov case is broken for β ̸= 1.
However, rotations of the orbital mixing still serve as a low-energy degree of
freedom for β close to 1.
4.3
Wave-Daughter Wave type
For ω < 1, corresponding to non-degeneracy of the orbitals, it is possible
to have one envelope function dominate throughout the core of the localized
wavefunction. In this wave-daughter wave approximation, the amplitude of the
daughter wave r2 is much smaller than that of the primary wave r1, leading
to the following approximate set of equations
 d2
dξ2 −1 + r2
1
!
r1 ≈0
 d2
dξ2 −ω2 + βr2
1
!
r2 ≈0
(15)
The top equation is recognized as the scalar nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
with a solution
r1(ξ) =
√
2 sech ξ
(16)
The primary wave provides an attractive potential for the daughter wave, and
the P¨oschl-Teller equation for the daughter wave results
 d2
dξ2 −ω2 + 2βsech2ξ
!
r2 = 0
(17)
This is known [9] to have a single bound state for 0 < β ≤1, with
r2(ξ) = α sechω ξ
(18)
and an eigenvalue constraint that ω = (√1 + 8β −1)/2.
Within these cases amenable to analytical solutions, it is seen that (1) vector
polaron states can support low-energy internal degrees of freedom, correspond-
ing to pseudo-rotations of the electron amplitude in the orbital space; and (2)
vector polaron states can have spatial variations in the orbital mixing and in
the character of the distortion, as illustrated in the wave-daughter wave type.

Vector Polarons in 2D
Vortex vector solitary wave solutions are known to exist in 2D. Consider solu-
tions to Eqs. 11 of the form ri(ρ, φ) = ψi(ρ) exp(imiφ). The following coupled
equations result

where ∆ρ ≡

. Vortex solutions to Eq. 19 may be labeled by the
topological charges |m1, m2⟩.
The simplest case is the |0, 0⟩solution, where both envelope functions are ra-
dially symmetric. Using an analytical variational method, the existence of a
localized |0, 0⟩solution has been shown [10]. Unfortunately this solution has
also been shown to be linearly unstable, as are all of these vortex solitons. Re-
lated multipole vector solitons [12] are also linearly unstable in this simpliﬁed
model.
However, similar solutions that are linearly stable have been found for slightly
modiﬁed systems of equations that include either saturable nonlinearities [10]
or nonlocal nonlinearities [11]. Saturable nonlinearities would physically corre-
spond to the addition of proper vibrational anharmonicity of higher orders in
this model, while nonlocal nonlinearity would correspond to gradient terms in
the elastic energy. Consequently there are indications that semiclassical mul-
ticomponent polaron states of the vortex and multipole varieties stably exist
in generalized models of 2D systems.

Jahn-Teller Soliton
Another related continuum model that employs a local Jahn-Teller coupling
can also lead to a stable soliton, a state involving a lump of excess electronic
charge trapped by a time-dependent pseudo-rotation of the elastic ﬁeld [13].
These solitons fall in the class of solutions known as non-topological Q-balls
[14] that have been invoked in models of cosmological phase transitions in the
early Universe [15].
Consider a continuum model with three electronic bands linearly coupled to
two degenerate elastic modes. Take the case of where the electronic bands
7transforms as x and y and a trivial orbital singlet; the two elastic modes
transform as x and y. The system may be described by the following Hamil-
tonian
H = He + Hph + HJT
(20)

where W is the energy splitting between the doublet bands and the singlet,
and m labels the states in the axial angular momentum basis.
Such a system has a continuous symmetry whose origin lies in the elec-
tronic and vibrational degeneracy. By virtue of Noether’s theorem, a conserved
charge Q results from this continuous symmetry provided it remains unbroken.
The constraint of ﬁxed Q provides stability to the soliton state.
For large Q, a variational ansatz called the thin wall approximation [14] has
been found to give good results in calculating the soliton energy. The ampli-
tude of the elastic deformation is taken to be constant over a ﬁnite region
of space with volume V , while vanishing outside that region. This deforma-
tion itself, however, is not constant; rather, it undergoes pseudorotations in
the two-fold degenerate space. It is straightforward to show that the Noether
charge Q is linearly proportional to the pseudorotation frequency ω and to
the square of the amplitude of distortion [13]
Q ≈ωξ2V
(24)
Thus, for suﬃciently large band splitting W, the energy of this thin-walled
soliton is
E = (Kph + U −EJT)V
≈1
2ω2ξ2V + U(ξ2)V −g2n0
W ξ2V
≈
Q2
2ξ2V + ˜U(ξ2)V
(25)
8where Kph and U are the kinetic and potential energy density of the time-
dependent distortion, EJT is the energy density from the electron-phonon
interaction, n0 is the electron density, and ˜U ≡U(ξ2) −g2n0
W ξ2. The last step
follows from using Eq. 24 to eliminate ω in favor of Q and ξ.
As Coleman [14] showed, the resulting energy can be minimized subject to
ﬁxed Q to ﬁnd the soliton energy and its size.
E = Q
v
u

t2 ˜U

(26)
V =

2 ˜Uξ2
(27)
Thus provided that the minimum value of 2 ˜U/ξ2 occurs at ξ ̸= 0, this Jahn-
Teller soliton cannot decay by emitting phonons that carry away the charge
Q, since the energy per charge is lower for the soliton. This criterion sets the
requirements on the amount and type of anharmonicity that are necessary to
stabilize the soliton.
In summary, it is noted that many of the solitons, both topological and non-
topological, that are found in multicomponent Ginzburg-Landau theories can
be used to describe vector polarons within the semiclassical theory outlined
here. Experimental STM studies of these states trapped at defects might
be used to reveal the non-trivial spatial structure of these polarons. Vector
polarons, together with the many-electron Q-ball-like excited state, serve as
examples that systems containing electronic and vibrational degeneracy can
support novel states through local Jahn-Teller interactions.
