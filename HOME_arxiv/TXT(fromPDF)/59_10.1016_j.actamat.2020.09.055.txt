Abstract
Contemporary powder-based polycrystalline nickel-base superalloys inherit microstructures and properties that are heavily deter-
mined by the thermo-mechanical treatments during processing. Here, the inﬂuence of a thermal exposure alone to an alloy powder
is studied to elucidate the controlling formation mechanisms of the strengthening precipitates using a combination of atom probe
tomography and in-situ neutron diﬀraction. The initial powder comprised a single-phase supersaturated γ only; from this, the evo-
lution of γ′ volume fraction and lattice misﬁt was assessed. The initial powder notably possessed elemental segregation of Cr and
Co and elemental repulsion between Ni, Al and Ti with Cr; here proposed to be a precursor for subsequent γ to γ′ phase transforma-
tions. Subsolvus heat treatments yielded a unimodal γ′ distribution, formed during heating, with evidence supporting its formation
to be via spinodal decomposition. A supersolvus heat treatment led to the formation of this same γ′ population during heating, but
dissolves as the temperature increases further. The γ′ then reprecipitates as a multimodal population during cooling, here forming
by classical nucleation and growth. Atom probe characterisation provided intriguing precipitate characteristics, including clear
diﬀerences in chemistry and microstructure, depending on whether the γ′ formed during heating or cooling.

1. Introduction
Understanding formation reactions and evolution behaviour
of ordered second phase precipitates is technologically critical
for a compendium of applications; these are most pertinent for
multi-component alloys used for structural applications. This
is acutely important for nickel-base superalloys, the material of
choice for the hottest sections of a gas turbine engines. These
alloys are designed with judicious elemental selection to confer
a balance between high temperature mechanical performance,
thermodynamic stability and corrosion resistance required for
long-term use in an aggressive in-service environment [1, 2].
The chosen multi-component compositions lead to complex mi-
crostructures and phase transformation behaviour; understand-
ing the governing mechanisms is most critical for the selection
of optimal processing parameters [3].
Modern nickel-base superalloy turbine discs are fabricated
from powders, a cost-eﬀective processing route developed to
give a step-change improvement in component performance through

improved alloy homogeneity and a ﬁner grain size over tradi-
tional cast and wrought processing methods [4, 5]. As there
are several stages in the alloy/component manufacture, there is
active research in understanding and optimising the microstruc-
ture of each processing method used. This includes hot isostatic
pressing (HIP) e.g.[6], thermomechanical processing e.g.[7] and
heat treatments e.g.[8]. It is notable that the majority of our un-
derstanding of microstructural control is derived from the ﬁnal
heat treatment ﬁnal stage. The approach, however, has a clear
weakness as it inhibits any understanding of γ →γ′ reaction
behaviour during the early stages of processing.
In polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy derivatives, the mul-
tiphase microstructure comprises an A1 structure γ matrix and
a dispersion of ordered, coherent L12 structure γ′ precipitates
with a low lattice misﬁt. The formation of γ′ precipitates has
been studied extensively in systems of varying compositional
complexity, focusing on how the precipitates nucleate and grow.
This has included binary Ni-Al [9, 10], ternary Ni-Al-Cr [11],
Ni-Al-Ti [12] and multicomponent systems [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
Model systems have low supersaturation, making it possible
to suppress γ′ formation, then observe γ′ forming via isother-
mal heat treatments. These studies indicate γ′ forms by clas-
sical nucleation. However, studying γ′ formation behaviour in
multicomponent systems, such as those used in a commercial

arXiv:2004.01146v2  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  17 Oct 2020powder metallurgy (PM) nickel-base superalloy, contain higher
concentration of γ′ forming elements, making it impossible to
suppress their formation during cooling tests due to the high
driving force for γ′ formation [18]. In this case, instead of clas-
sical nucleation, some authors have speculated that γ′ forms via
spinodal decomposition during the early stages. Tan et al. [19]
showed evidence of interconnected networks of γ′ with diﬀuse
interfaces and compositions far from equilibrium, observed fol-
lowing fast quenching. These results here were indicative that
chemical ordering can occur concurrently to spinodal decom-
position.
In order to investigate whether the formation of γ′ occurs
by the classical nucleation mechanism or spinodal decomposi-
tion, we have studied the microstructural evolution of γ′ from a
highly supersaturated γ phase in a nickel-base superalloy pow-
der. The nature of powder production sees individual particles
solidify exceptionally quickly, where they are subjected to cool-
ing rates far greater than would be possible in bulk samples,
simply by virtue of the heat transfer limitations from the signif-
icant volume diﬀerence. Hence, the cooling rate during powder
production is hypothesised to be suﬃciently rapid to entirely
suppress the γ′ formation, even in a highly alloyed superalloy
derivative with high concentrations of γ′ forming elements.
In this study we have exposed a nickel-base superalloy pow-
der to thermal cycles that reach temperatures above and below
the γ′ solvus temperature whilst acquiring neutron diﬀraction
data in-situ. Our results reveal that γ′ not only forms during
cooling but also during heating via spinodal decomposition.
Furthermore, depending on the heat treatment temperature, the
distribution and morphology of γ′ precipitates alters from an
interconnected network of precipitates, to a unimodal distribu-
tion and ﬁnally to a multimodal precipitate distribution. Un-
derstanding the precipitate formation sequence is supported by
atom probe tomography measurements which ascertain charac-
teristic compositional diﬀerences as a function of the prescribed
subsolvus or supersolvus heat treatment.
2. Method
2.1. Material
Powder of the commercial nickel-base superalloy RR1000
was produced by gas atomisation with the following nominal
composition (wt.%): Ni-15Cr-18.5Co-5Mo-3Al-3.6Ti-2Ta-0.5Hf-
0.06Zr-0.027C-0.015B.
2.2. Neutron Diﬀraction
Diﬀraction data were collected on the ENGIN-X instrument
at the ISIS neutron spallation source, UK. A setup of the exper-
iment is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The beamline was
equipped with a vacuum furnace suitable for in-situ heating ex-
periments. An incident neutron beam illuminated a probed vol-
ume in the sample measuring approximately 8 × 8 × 8 mm3,
determined by the cross-section size of the incident mean and
the collimators. The diﬀraction signal was measured from two
detectors, both orthogonal to the incident beam, arriving from

diﬀraction vectors parallel to the radial direction of the cylin-
drical sample (labelled qnorth and qsouth in Fig. 1). Further in-
strument details are available elsewhere [20].
Cylindrical alumina crucibles (12 mm outer diameter (9.5 mm
inner diameter) × 14 mm high) were ﬁlled with alloy powder
and inserted into vanadium cans before being placed into the
beam line furnace. Sample temperatures were monitored us-
ing R-type thermocouples, placed in contact with the crucibles.
Three thermal cycles were examined, with samples reaching (i)
900◦C, (ii) 1000◦C and (iii) 1150◦C. Samples were heated at
20◦C min−1, held at the target temperature for 15 minutes, then
cooled at 20◦C min−1. The data acquisition time was 1.5 min-
utes per diﬀraction pattern.
2.3. Diﬀraction Data Analysis
From the set of diﬀraction patterns acquired from the time-
of-ﬂight measurements, γ/γ′ volume fraction, lattice parameter
and lattice misﬁt are calculated. These parameters were ob-
tained from the following analysis procedure, here applied to
each individual diﬀraction pattern.
The γ′ volume faction was found by summing the inte-
grated intensities of several γ′ superlattice reﬂections, compris-
ing {011}γ′, {012}γ′ and {112}γ′. Numerical integration was con-
ducted via a simple trapezium rule for each reﬂection across a
peak width of 0.2 Å. As the (01¯4)α and (116)α reﬂections lie in
close proximity to the {011}γ′ and {012}γ′ reﬂections, a contri-
bution of their signals was included in the numerical integra-
tion. As it was known that there was no γ′ present at t = 0
(see APT results later) and no separate superlattice reﬂection
contribution could be detected, the intensity associated with the
alumina could be subtracted. This provides the temporal inte-
grated γ′ intensity, Iγ′
hkl(t) for a superlattice reﬂection hkl. At
the end of the experiment, at t = tend, the equilibrium γ′ vol-
ume fraction, φeq, was reached. This temporal volume fraction,
φγ′(t), could then be approximated by:
φγ′(t) =
Iγ′
hkl(t)
Iγ′
hkl(t = tend)
φγ′
eq
(1)
The γ′ lattice parameter was obtained by ﬁtting the {112}γ′
reﬂection with a Gaussian function to obtain its d-spacing, d112.
Assuming a powder average, the lattice parameter was given by
aγ′ = dγ′
112
√
N, where N = 6 for the {112} reﬂection. The γ lat-
tice parameter was obtained by ﬁtting a fundamental reﬂection
associated with this phase. As the lattice parameters of the γ
2and γ′ phases are near identical, their fundamental reﬂections
overlap, necessitating separation of their independent intensity
contributions. The procedure utilised here is developed from
prior studies of nickel-base superalloys [21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
For a fundamental reﬂection, as reﬂections overlap, the ob-
served intensity proﬁle as a function of d-spacing, d, denoted
as Iγ+γ′
hkl (d), can be approximated by the sum of two Gaussian
functions as:

0 are amplitude scaling constants, dγ′
0 & dγ
0 are
the mean peak positions, corresponding to the planar d-spacing
for each respective phase and hkl, βγ′ & βγ determine proﬁle
breadth and Ibkg is the uniform background intensity.
Due to the high number of free ﬁtting variables in Equa-
tion 2, obtaining a numerically stable ﬁtted solution using this
formulation is near impossible. This is owing to the near iden-
tical d-spacings of the γ and γ′ phases. Some of the variables
can, however, be ﬁxed, using information associated with the γ′
phase already obtained from the superlattice reﬂections. Firstly,
dγ′
0 can be inferred from aγ′. In this data analysis, the {200} re-
ﬂection was used, hence dγ′
0 = aγ′/2. As the ENGIN-X yields
diﬀraction line proﬁles which are largely dominated by a large
intrinsic peak width, it can be assumed that the contribution of
line broadening from the sample is small, hence the line proﬁles
for the γ and γ′ phases are assumed equal and so βγ′ = βγ. The
ﬁnal assumption is that the ratio of integrated intensities of the
γ and γ′ reﬂections can be related to the phase volume fractions
and structure factors via

are the γ & γ′ structure factors and φγ & φγ′ are the γ & γ′ vol-
ume fractions. Equation 3 holds for fundamental reﬂections γ
& γ′ reﬂections of equal hkl, where their d-spacings are similar.
Using the measured φγ′ from the ﬁtted superlattice reﬂections,
it follows φγ(t) = 1 −φγ′(t), assuming only γ and γ′ phases are
present.
Structure factors for the γ and γ′ phases were calculated for
their A1 and L12 crystal structures. Composition predictions
as a function of temperature were calculated with the Thermo-
Calc [26] software using the Thermotech TCNI6 thermodynamic
database [27]. All phases other than γ and γ′ were suspended
in these calculations. The calculation for the γ and γ′ structure
factors are described in detail elsewhere [24], as well as site
occupancies for alloy RR1000 [28]. These composition pre-
dictions were also used to calculate the equilibrium γ′ volume
fraction, φeq, of 0.46 as required for Eq. 1; this value is in close
agreement to independent measurements of the RR1000 alloy
[29].
The use of a Gaussian line proﬁle enables use of its analyt-
ical solution for its integrated intensity:

This function was incorporated into the ﬁtting function, Equa-
tion 2, when ﬁtting a γ/γ′ fundamental reﬂection. Once dγ
0 was
obtained and aγ was calculated, the lattice misﬁt, δ, was ob-
tained for each diﬀraction measurement using the expression:
δ = 2aγ′ −aγ

2.4. TEM characterisation
Powders were mounted in conductive Bakelite and polished
using conventional metallographic preparation procedures with
an extended ﬁnal colloidal silica stage to minimise preparation
induced deformation in the surface.
Samples for Transmis-
sion Electron Microscope (TEM) analysis were prepared us-
ing a FEI Versa 3D dual beam a system combining Focussed
Ion Beam (FIB) and a Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron
Microscope (FEG-SEM). Samples were extracted from within
a single powder particle using a standard in-situ liftout proce-
dure, however great care was taken to ensure that the thick-
ness of the samples was homogeneous and similar for all sam-
ples. The composition of the phases within a powder particle
were measured using a FEI Talos F200X Field Emission Gun
(Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscope (FEG-(S)TEM)
equipped with a Super X energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
system. Chemical distribution spectra maps were collected us-
ing EDS in STEM mode and quantiﬁcation was performed from
reconstructing areas within the maps from multiple areas where
there was no/minimal apparent overlap between the phases us-
ing Velox software.
Further TEM characterisation was conducted where diﬀrac-
tion contrast microscopy was used to produce electron diﬀrac-
tion and dark-ﬁeld images. Here, a liftout procedure was used
to prepare a TEM foil using an FEI Helios G4 CX FIB operated
at 30 kV. A low, 5 kV, ion beam was used for surface cleaning
for a period of 2 minutes on each side of the TEM samples in
order to remove the outer layer of the specimens aﬀected by
FIB beam damage. The specimen was observed using a FEI
Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV.
32.5. Atom Probe Tomography
To obtain three-dimensional compositional information of
the γ and γ′ microstructure, samples were prepared for atom
probe tomography (APT) via a site speciﬁc lift out method (de-
scribed in [30]) using an FEI Dual Beam FIB Helios 600i. Sam-
ples from the initial powder and from samples heat treated in the
beam line experiments (these samples had 900◦C, 1000◦C and
1150◦C thermal exposures) were characterised. The specimens
were extracted from random sites within each sample. The APT
measurements were conducted using a Cameca LEAP 3000 HR
instrument, operated with a pulsed laser at 200 kHz, with a
pulse energy of 0.4 nJ and at a temperature of 60 K. Data re-
construction and subsequent analysis was performed using the
software IVAS 3.8.2.
3. Results
3.1. Starting Powder
Figure 2: Secondary SEM micrograph of RR1000 powder after gas atomisation.
A secondary electron micrograph of the starting alloy pow-
der is shown in Fig. 2 indicating the spherical morphology of
the individual powder particles and a distribution of diameters,
approximately in the range 2-15µm. Atom probe tomography
measurements were made on the starting powder; composition
measurements from 3 diﬀerent samples, each taken from the
same powder particle, are shown in Table 1. The composi-
tion was approximately uniform within each specimen without
showing any signiﬁcant variations.
The occurrence of a compositional segregation that can be
the precursor of phase separation was investigated in the ini-
tial powder. An APT reconstruction from the initial powder is
shown in Fig. 3 alongside its corresponding frequency distri-
bution analysis. In particular, the corresponding binomial, i.e.
random, distribution is plotted to allow for comparison with the
experimental distribution of the elements: Ni, Cr, Al and Ti.
In the case of Ni, the experimental distribution does not fol-
low the binomial distribution, indicating that Ni is not arranged
completely randomly. This was further conﬁrmed by the Pear-
son coeﬃcient, µ, which is given in Table 2, that can be used
to reveal statistical deviation from randomness. The Pearson
coeﬃcient is indicated with values between 0 and 1, where 0

positional segregation [31]. From Table 2, an obvious deviation
from a random distribution is observed in the case of Ni and Cr,
whereas the distribution of Ti and Al is closer to random.
Figure 3: APT reconstruction from an initial powder particle alongside fre-
quency distribution analysis of Ni, Cr, Al and Ti for the same data.
In addition, radial distribution functions (RDF) were calcu-
lated from the APT data, in order to conﬁrm a compositional
segregation. In this case, each neighbourhood solute surround-
ing a speciﬁc species is examined and an average composition
of each solute as a function of the radial distance to this par-
ticular species is calculated [32, 33, 34]). Fig. 4 shows the
RDF of Cr with Co, Ti, Ni, Cr and Al indicating a composi-
tional segregation. In particular, the Cr-Cr and Cr-Co RDFs
exhibit similar behaviour indicating that Cr and Co atoms tend
to prefer to segregate together, creating regions of high Cr/Co
content. In contrast, Ni, Al and Ti atoms appear repelled by the
Cr atoms, resulting in regions enriched in γ′ forming elements.
In contrast, regions enriched in γ′ forming elements appear to
form, as indicated by the concurrent segregation of Ni, Al and
Ti atoms. Similar observations of such compositional separa-
tion were performed before in a Ni-5.2Al-14.2Cr (at.%) alloy
[33], whereas spinodal decomposition based on RDF analysis

regation in the initial powder.
3.2. In-situ Neutron Diﬀraction
The alloy powder was heated in-situ whilst collecting diﬀrac-
tion data. Samples heated to 900◦C, 1000◦C and 1150◦C have
their respective thermocouple data shown in Fig. 5 a, b & c, and
the corresponding temporal diﬀraction intensity shown in Fig.
5 d, e & f. The intensity data shows labels of the most intense
reﬂections from the alloy (γ and γ′) and the alumina crucible
(α).
The analysed diﬀraction data results are shown in Fig 6.
Here, temporally resolved measurements of γ′ volume fraction,
γ & γ′ lattice parameter and their corresponding lattice misﬁt.
The key features of the diﬀering responses for each sample will
be described here in turn.
For the sample heated to 900◦C, as the powder is heated, the
γ′ volume fraction remains 0% until ∼700◦C. The values have
been determined by tracking the evolution of γ′ superlattice re-
ﬂections, giving a measure of phase ordering (and not compo-
sition localisation). Evidence of γ′ forming is clear above this
temperature as its volume fraction increases; reaching ∼25%
once 900◦C is reached. With the short isothermal hold, the vol-
ume fraction continues to increase, reaching approximately the
equilibrium volume fraction (∼0.46 as calculated by Thermo-
Calc) prior to cooling. The volume fraction does not change
during cooling. The remaining γ′ following the thermal cycle
has formed during the heating and isothermal hold period only.
No additional γ′ formed during cooling is evident.
During heating to 1000◦C, the γ′ begins to form at ∼700◦C
(replicating the observation when heated to 900◦C). As the tem-
perature passes 900◦C during heating, the γ′ volume fraction
drops slightly, from ∼25% to ∼20% and remains at this value
until the end of the isothermal hold at 1000◦C. As the sample
cools, the γ′ volume fraction was seen to increase, reaching
an approximately equilibrium volume fraction as the tempera-
ture drops below ∼500◦C. It is unambiguously clear that the γ′
remaining after the thermal cycling comprised γ′ formed both
during heating and cooling.
A ﬁnal sample was heated to the 1150◦C, which is above
the γ′ solvus temperature. The γ′ phase forms during heating,
as observed in the prior heating studies, then dissolves as the
temperature approaches the solvus temperature. When the so-
lution heat treatment temperature is reached, only the γ phase
is present. As the alloy is cooled, the intensity corresponding to
the γ′ refections increases until an equilibrium volume fraction
is reached by ∼500◦C. The γ′ phase present at room tempera-
ture in this sample evidently all formed during the cooling stage
of the thermal cycle.
The γ/γ′ lattice parameters and corresponding lattice misﬁt
measurements for the three heat treatment conditions is shown
in Fig. 6 (g-l). For all tests, when the volume fraction of γ′
is low (<10%) there is considerable scatter in the lattice mis-
ﬁt and γ′ lattice parameter measurements due to uncertainty
from ﬁtting the weak {112}γ′ superlattice reﬂection; these val-
ues have therefore been eliminated from the results. For precip-
itates formed during heating, for 900◦C and 1000◦C samples,
as shown in Fig.6(j) and Fig.6(k), the lattice misﬁt was posi-
tive, whereas the formation of precipitates during cooling from
1150◦C, Fig.6 (l) possessed a negative lattice misﬁt, which ap-
proaches zero at ∼700◦C.
3.3. Post mortem characterisation
3.3.1. Electron microscopy
TEM characterisation of the powders exposed to subsolvus
γ′ temperatures were observed post mortem, as shown in Fig.
7, with a HAADF image after 900◦C (Fig. 7 a) after 1000◦C
exposure (Fig. 7 b). Neither sample was observed to have pri-
mary γ′ present at the grain boundaries. The dashed box in
each HAADF image represents the composition maps for each

respective sample in Fig. 7. Cr and Ti are shown as exam-
ples of γ and γ′ rich elements, respectively, to illustrate the
size and distribution of these phases. The composition maps
after 900◦C, show evidence of locally rich Ti regions, depleted
of Cr, however, observing the microstructure here is resolution
limited, as features appear diﬀuse. As a result, the morphology
of individual γ′ precipitates is diﬃcult to determine using this
characterisation method.
To ascertain whether the γ′ precipitates could be better de-
termined using diﬀraction contrast microscopy, this sample was
observed using bright and dark ﬁeld imaging modes. A bright
ﬁeld (BF) image of the 900◦C annealed sample is shown in Fig.
8a, the region highlighted as ‘DIFF’ corresponds the region
where the electron diﬀraction pattern (Fig. 8b) was acquired.
Using a selected superlattice (112) plane, a high magniﬁcation
DF image shown in Fig. 8d and corresponding bright ﬁeld Fig.
8c images were produced to reveal contrast between the γ and
γ′ phases. The dark/bright contrast shows clear evidence of re-
gions of diﬀerent γ and γ′ crystallographic structures present
in this sample. Referring to the DF image, a morphologically
complex network of γ′ precipitates can be seen. This includes
evidence of narrow necked regions (identiﬁed with arrows), ap-
pearing bright to denote an L12 γ′ crystal structure, that con-
nect neighbouring γ′ precipitates. Some of the γ′ features are
diﬃcult to distinguish, this is because the signal is integrated
through the thickness of the TEM sample of a rather complex

3D interconnected γ′ network and results in several γ′ features
superimposed, that cannot be individually distinguished. Fur-
thermore, the blurring of the γ′ is partly due to the TEM reso-
lution limit, however, it is also possible that the γ/γ′ interface
does not possess a sharp A1/L12 structure transition.
Inspection of the sample subjected to the 1000◦C anneal
shows a population of approximately spherical γ′ precipitates
can be seen (by Cr depleted regions, Fig. 7d and Ti rich regions,
Fig. 7f), appearing as a unimodal size distribution of ∼40 nm
diameter.
The sample subjected to a thermal cycle up to 1150◦C was
examined post-mortem with a scanning electron microscope; a
backscattered electron (BSE) micrograph reveals a multimodal
γ′ distribution as shown in Fig. 9. Secondary γ′ precipitates
with an octodentric morphology can be seen with a size of sev-
eral hundred nanometers. In between the secondary γ′ precip-
itates there is a much ﬁner distribution (< 50 nm) of spherical
tertiary γ′ precipitates. There is also evidence of a depleted γ′
zone in the γ matrix in regions close to the secondary γ′ inter-
face. These observations are near identical to the microstructure
observed in fully processed RR1000 subjected to a supersolvus
heat treatment followed by a slow cool (1◦C min−1) [37].
From HAADF-STEM, STEM-EDS and APT characterisa-
tion results presented in the associated manuscript, this sample
comprised γ and γ′ phases with interconnected networks of γ′
precipitates, which was inferred by inspection/reconstruction of
the chemical composition spacial distributions. By conducting
diﬀraction contrast spectroscopy, the observed microstructure
can be related to the crystallography of these phases.

3.3.2. Atom probe tomography
The composition of the γ′ precipitates formed at 900◦C,
1000◦C and 1150◦C was measured by APT. Fig. 10 shows sec-
tions from two APT reconstructions from the powder exposed
at 900◦C for 15 minutes. For both datasets, clear interfaces be-
tween γ′ precipitates and γ matrix can be seen. However, the γ′
precipitates exhibit a rather complex morphology. In particular,
the γ′ precipitates appear to be interconnected and have irregu-
lar shape, corroborating the observations made with TEM (Fig.
8). Such morphology was observed previously for γ′ precip-
itates formed by spinodal decomposition during cooling [19].
We have presented only sections of the 3D-reconstructions in
order to reveal the complex microstructure. The composition
of the γ′ precipitates and the γ matrix regions as measured by
APT are shown in Table 3. Although, the composition of the γ′
particles formed during heating is relatively constant, the com-
position of the γ matrix shows some variations particularly in
the case of Al, Ti and Co.
Fig. 11 shows two APT reconstructions from the powder
exposed at 1000◦C for 15 minutes. The morphology of the
γ′ precipitates is diﬀerent compared to that after 15 minutes at
900◦C. In particular, the γ′ precipitates are not interconnected
and this is consistent with the observations from TEM in Fig.

tion of the of the γ′ precipitates and the γ matrix measured at
1000◦C shows some variation when compared to that of 900◦C.

Fig. 12 shows APT 3D-reconstructions from the powder
exposed at 1150◦C for 15 minutes. In particular, in Fig. 12a the
reconstruction contains secondary γ′ precipitates, γ matrix and
tertiary γ′ precipitates. The tertiary γ′ precipitates will be de-
noted as γ′
I (type I). Regions depleted of tertiary γ′ precipitates
in the vicinity of the secondary γ′ precipitates can also be ob-
served. In Fig. 12b, the APT reconstruction contains a part of a
secondary γ′ precipitate and tertiary γ′ precipitates. In this case,
two diﬀerent populations of tertiary γ′ precipitates can be ob-
served based on their size. In particular, γ′
I tertiary precipitates
next to a depleted γ′ precipitates zone, similar to those seen in
Fig. 12a. At larger distances from the depleted region, the ter-
tiary γ′ precipitates with relatively larger size than those of γ′
I
can be observed. Those tertiary precipitates are denoted as γ′
II
(type II) tertiary precipitates. Precise quantitative information
on the size of the tertiary precipitates cannot be extracted by the
APT reconstructions, because the reconstructions are not based
on crystallographic information that would allow that. Thus,
the information on the size of the tertiary precipitates is only
qualitative.
The two diﬀerent populations of tertiary precipitates have
also signiﬁcant variations in terms of chemistry as it is shown
in Fig. 13. The composition of the tertiary γ′
II precipitates in
this graph is the average of the four precipitates shown in Fig.
12b, whereas the composition of the tertiary γ′
I is the average
of ten precipitates. Substantial diﬀerences can be seen for all

elements between the two populations. The tertiary γ′
I have
higher amounts of γ former elements, such as Cr, Co and Mo
indicating that they were the last precipitates to form during
cooling. As a consequence, there was not enough time to reach
the equilibrium by rejecting the γ former elements. In addi-
tion, a chemical ﬂuctuations were observed in the γ matrix. In
particular, the γ composition was extracted from three diﬀerent
locations denoted as #1, #2 and #3 in Fig. 12b and they are
given in Table 5. It can be seen, that close to the interface of
matrix with the secondary γ′ precipitate (area #1) the amount of
Cr and Co are relatively higher compared to the regions where
tertiary precipitates have formed. This region correspond to the
denuded region that observed close to the secondary γ′ precipi-
tates in the powder exposed at 1150◦C for 15 minutes. By con-
trast, the amount of Ni is lower in the depleted region compared
to the regions where tertiary γ′ precipitates have formed. It is
believed that the local chemical ﬂuctuations are due to coars-
ening of the secondary γ′ precipitates, that they reject γ former
elements and consume γ′ former solutes from the surrounding
matrix.
4. Discussion
This study newly reveals the γ →γ′ transformation be-
haviour from a Ni-base superalloy powder, building on knowl-
edge obtained from numerous studies that targets the under-
standing of the equivalent transformation behaviour, but instead
using material that has undergone no prior thermo-mechanical

processing. By removing the thermo-mechanical processing as-
pects, this study aimed to identify how the γ →γ′ evolution
changes, when such inﬂuences are removed. In the following
discussion, the mechanisms associated with precipitate forma-
tion during heating and cooling are discussed, followed by its
relevance to practical application and an assessment of the char-
acterisation methods used in this study.
4.1. Precipitate formation during heating
A schematic summary of the observed γ′ formation behaviour
is given in Fig. 14. Notably, the microstructures following each
of the heat treatments have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent characteris-
tics. The samples that were exposed to the subsolvus tempera-
tures are discussed ﬁrst. The 900◦C sample leaves an intercon-
nected network of γ′ precipitates, consistent with precipitates
observed in superalloys [38] and other systems [39] where the
formation was proposed to be via spinodal decomposition.
The starting γ phase will undergo phase separation via spin-
odal decomposition, in which nm-scale domains within the γ
phase possess local chemical enrichment of certain elements

such as Al, Ti, Ta and Ni, considered to be the γ′ forming el-
ements, whilst they are lean in the elements such as Co, Cr
and Mo. Forming domains which become enriched/depleted
in these elements is easy as precursor clustering from the nm-
scale segregation is already present in the powder following the
gas atomisation. From the chemical ﬂuctuations, an ordering
reaction from the A1→L12 structure will follow; noting that
short range order is easy due to the small atomic displacements
needed, leading to a ﬁne scale dispersion of ordered γ′ precipi-
tates.
This reaction is thermodynamically favourable if, at a low
temperature, a miscibility gap exists within the γ phase where
compositional partitioning through spinodal decomposition leads
to the formation of two disordered A1 structured phases, γ(1)
and γ(2). Subsequent chemical ordering within one of these dis-
ordered phases will result in L12 structured γ′ precipitates. [19,
38]. The composition of this alloy is proposed to lie within this
region where a spontaneous unmixing reaction is favourable. It
is proposed that as the sample was heated, regions with chem-
ical ﬂuctuations were more stable than the γ phase, leading to
an energetically favourable phase separation to γ(1) + γ(2). The
thermal energy by heating enables a continuous phase separa-
tion reaction to proceed, promoting the formation of Al/Ti/Ta/Ni
rich domains to form. When the enrichment has reached a crit-
ical value, a favourable L12 chemical ordering reaction will en-
sue. This mechanism assumes that the transformation pathway
follows spinodal decomposition-based phase separation ﬁrst,
followed by structural ordering; this sequence seems probable
10considering the segregation of Al/Ti/Ni and Co/Cr in the start-
ing condition, and the L12 γ′ structure is detected via diﬀraction
only when the compound exceeds ∼700◦C, this corresponds to
the temperature where diﬀusion is favourable for signiﬁcant so-
lute transport.
An alternative transformation pathway known as conditional
spinodal [40] is also possible. In this mechanism, a congruent
ordering reaction of the γ phase occurs leading to the formation
of a single ordered γ′ phase. Spinodal decomposition subse-
quently occurs within the γ′ phase to form two ordered L12
structured phases, γ′
(1) and γ′
(2). Only when either γ′
(1) or γ′
(2)
undergoes a disordering reaction to form γ, will the ﬁnal mi-
crostructure comprise both γ + γ′. It is, however, noted that
conﬁrming this mechanism is operative during heating would
be challenging as the equilibrium γ phase fraction increases
with temperature. Distinguishing this eﬀect over a γ′
(1) →γ
or γ′
(2) →γ disordering reaction, via neutron diﬀraction mea-
surements as performed in this study, would be diﬃcult.
Once the γ′ structure exists, the γ′ precipitates grow with
a concomitant long-range diﬀusion and structural ordering, as
evidenced by the in-situ measurements of increasing γ′ volume
fraction. The γ′ morphology change and volume fraction in-
crease is now driven by (1) minimising the elastic strain energy
from lattice misﬁt strains (2) the reduction of the large inter-
facial energy associated with a ﬁne scale γ′ and (3) reach the
thermodynamic equilibrium composition.
Further evidence of spinodal decomposition during heating
is observed from the presence of small satellite reﬂections in
the neutron diﬀraction data, close to fundamental reﬂections.
The observation of satellite reﬂections are direct measurements
of the composition modulation, as has been demonstrated on
diﬀerent systems via XRD [14] and TEM [41]. Evidence of the
satellite reﬂection is observed in the neutron diﬀraction data in
this study, in the vicinity of the {111} reﬂection, as shown in
Fig. 15. These satellite reﬂections were very weak, however,
could be observed when the data was summed. Each pattern in
Fig. 15 corresponds to data acquired for 14 minutes. Whilst the
temporal resolution here is not high, it is evident that the com-
position modulation associated with spinodal is evident during
heating, isothermal hold and initial cooling. This satellite peak
disappears as the sample cools, indicative that the composition
ﬁelds are moving towards equilibrium, and the modulation is no
longer strong enough to produce this diﬀraction characteristic.
As there is evidence that the sample heated to 1000◦C re-
sulted in γ′ initially forming during heating, the resulting γ′
must have formed via spinodal decomposition, similar to the
900◦C sample. The resulting microstructure comprising an ap-
proximately unimodal distribution, not interconnected γ′ like
the 900◦C sample, indicates this evolution is diﬀusion driven,
enabled by the higher temperature heat treatment. During this
time, the γ′ form morphologically stable spherical precipitates,
as the interfacial energy of the precipitates reduces via coarsen-
ing, as expected from the Cahn-Hilliard model for spinodal de-
composition [42]. The unimodal γ′ size distribution further in-
dicates all precipitates formed together; initiating upon heating.
As the 1000◦C sample cools there is evidence of near zero lat-
tice misﬁt, indicating the precipitates did not have to overcome
energetically unfavourable misﬁt strains, which if present, would
have promoted non-spherical precipitate morphologies due to
the anisotropic stiﬀness of the cubic γ′ [43].
4.2. Precipitate formation during cooling
When γ′ has formed during cooling, as is evident from the
sample heated to a supersolvus temperature of 1150◦C then
cooled, there is considerable evidence to indicate the precip-
itate formation mechanism is dissimilar to γ′ formed during
heating.
The multimodal distribution is consistent with ob-
servations made by others, who attribute the generation of γ′
from classical nucleation and growth [13, 44, 16]. Each gen-
eration of γ′ forms during cooling, where the driving force for
γ′ nucleation occurs from increased undercooling. Growth of
a γ′ distribution will continue whilst the temperature is high,
though its driving force for solute diﬀusion decreases as tem-
perature becomes lower. Growth is inhibited by soft impinge-
ment when solute ﬁelds overlap, however, further cooling re-
sults in non-equilibrium γ′ compositions away from the γ/γ′
interfaces, which with further undercooling, result in a further
nucleation burst [15]. In this study, this mechanism is corrobo-
rated by (1) the presence of secondary γ′ and tertiary γ′ precip-
itate distributions, (2) the compositions of the precipitate dis-
tributions are dissimilar, indicating their formation at diﬀerent
temperatures as the supersaturated γ composition changes, (3)
the dissimilar morphologies of secondary γ′ (octodendritic) and
tertiary γ′ (spherical) indicates their growth has occurred with
precipitates from each distribution subjected to diﬀerent misﬁt
strains. The initial secondary γ′ to form upon cooling has a lat-
tice misﬁt of -0.5%, suﬃcient to favour octodendritic morphol-
ogy to develop due to the interaction between diﬀusion driven
growth and non-uniform elastic strain ﬁelds around precipitates
from the γ′ elastic anisotropy [43]. This eﬀect diminishes as
the temperature is lowered, such that the lattice misﬁt is close
to zero when the tertiary γ′ forms, resulting in spherical precip-
itates for this distribution. Due to these factors, there was no
evidence that the γ′ precipitates formed by spinodal decompo-
sition during cooling.
4.3. Implications
The γ′ that has formed during heating, in the 900◦C and
1000◦C samples, is entirely a diﬀusion driven process. A clas-
sical nucleation is not plausible as there is no undercooling, and
therefore no driving force for this process. Unimodal γ′ size
distributions, similar to the microstructure achieved here from
the sample heated to 1000◦C, have been achieved by others by
cooling samples rapidly [18, 45, 46]. There remains disagree-
ment in the literature on how such distributions form upon cool-
ing; where the precipitates are nucleation controlled, though un-
dercooling is so high that it outruns diﬀusion and the condition
for soft impingement is not met [13], whereas Viswanathan et
al. [38] indicates phase separation initiates by spinodal decom-
position. There is clear scope to widen the study, particularly
for diﬀerent compositions and cooling rates to conﬁrm under
the precise conditions spinodal decomposition mechanism pre-
vails.

Whilst unimodal microstructures created by rapid cooling
oﬀer desirable increases in yield strength over slower cooled
samples [46], quenching is impractical for real manufacture of
large components. Problems include the creation of high resid-
ual stresses [47], and transient thermal gradients and inhomo-
geneous microstructures [48]. The study here creates similarly
desirable microstructures (in the 1000◦C sample, for example)
directly from the powder without cooling related issues. Con-
trol at this stage could be used to mitigate or change parameters
of subsequent thermomechanical treatments. This work also
has enormous implications for the use of nickel-base superal-
loy powders used in additive manufacturing (AM) processes,
where the γ →γ′ transformation behaviour is largely unknown.
Such AM process could exploit microstructural control through
γ′ formation during heating regimes for the ﬁrst time.
Finally, in context to the HIP treatment of powders during
the commercial fabrication of turbine rotor discs, this study
gives insight into the microstructural development.
The tri-
modal γ′ distribution comprising primary, secondary and ter-
tiary γ′ during subsolvus HIP treatments of RR1000 [49] was
not observed here. The absence of pressure in this study pre-
vents primary γ′ forming. This is to be expected as elevated
temperature alone enables γ′ to form before powder particles
are fully consolidated. It is speculated that only when an exter-
nally applied pressure is suﬃcient to fully consolidate powder
particles before γ′ formation begins, diﬀusional processes at
grain boundaries required to nucleate primary γ′ are possible.
Conﬁrming this mechanism is proposed for future work.
4.4. Characterisation
To quantify the γ →γ′ reactions in-situ, the ENGIN-X
beamline was selected for its ability to obtain diﬀraction data
from a large sample volume (several mm3), without the signal
being signiﬁcantly attenuated by an alumina crucible contain-
ing the powder, a high temperature furnace and a rapid data ac-
quisition rate (1.5 minutes per pattern). To analyse results from
data collected at this rate, however, a new data analysis strategy
was employed here, based on constrained Gaussian proﬁles.
The diﬀraction line proﬁle shape used here was Gaussian,
deemed to be a suitable approximation to the experimentally
12obtained line proﬁle shape. Whilst the pure instrument pro-
ﬁle for reﬂections from ENGIN-X is better ﬁtted with a con-
volution of a Voigt function with a truncated exponential [50],
no peak asymmetry nor Cauchy character was evident, which
is explained by dominant broadening contributions from the
specimen geometry and sample size/strain broadening. Using
a Gaussian line proﬁle also had the advantage that the intensi-
ties of the γ and γ′ reﬂections of a fundamental reﬂection can be
easily coupled via the analytical solution of integrated Gaussian
intensity (i.e. Equation 5). This signiﬁcantly constrained the
problem of ﬁtting 2 superimposed reﬂections with independent
variables for each, which is most diﬃcult when γ and γ′ phases
have near identical lattice parameters. Fitting the data here with
more complex functions, such as those with convolutions, was
found to be inappropriate due to increased ﬁtting variables that
results in scatter in the ﬁtted coeﬃcients, primarily due to nu-
merical instability. The approach adopted here demonstrated
that the use of more complex ﬁtting functions to analyse super-
alloy datasets is suitable only when high signal-to-noise data
is available (i.e. synchrotron data over time-of-ﬂight data col-
lected here) or when γ/γ′ diﬀerences in lattice parameter make
direct peak separation possible.
5. Conclusions
The phase transformation from γ to γ′ was investigated in
a nickel-base superalloy powder subjected to heat treatments at
900◦C, 1000◦C and 1150◦C for 15 min with controlled heat-
ing and cooling during in-situ neutron diﬀraction. Insights here
were combined with post mortem characterisation using atom
probe tomography and electron microscopy to elucidate com-
position and microstructure evolution. From this, the following
conclusions can be drawn:
1. Characterisation of the gas atomised powder, prior to any
further processing, shows no evidence of structural or-
dering, however, near-atomic scale compositional segre-
gation was observed. Cr and Co atoms were found to seg-
regate together, whereas Ni, Al and Ti atoms are repelled
by Cr atoms resulting in regions enriched in γ′ elements.
This segregational behaviour can act as the precursor to
phase separation.
2. A thermal cycle reaching 900◦C leads to the formation
of γ′ precipitates during heating by spinodal decompo-
sition, conﬁrmed by neutron diﬀraction and atom probe
tomography. The γ′ precipitates in this case formed only
during heating and possessed an interconnected γ′ net-
work with an irregular morphology. No γ′ precipitates
formed during cooling. Signiﬁcant composition variation
was observed in the γ phase in the post mortem analysis.
3. A thermal cycle reaching 1000◦C similarly formed γ′
via spinodal decomposition during heating. The γ′ vol-
ume fraction increased during cooling whilst solute diﬀu-
sion prevailed, as the system approached thermodynamic
equilibrium. Observing this material post mortem indi-
cates the system is indeed closer to equilibrium compared
to the 900◦C sample, comprising a unimodal γ′ distri-
bution, a homogenous γ & γ′ composition and coarser
spherical precipitate morphology, indicative of a reduced
interfacial energy.
4. A multimodal γ′ distribution was observed after heat-
ing above the γ′ solvus at 1150◦C, where γ′ precipitates
formed only during cooling based on classical nucleation
and growth mechanisms; there was no evidence of spin-
odal decomposition. This mechanism was corroborated
by distribution of precipitates sizes, compositional dif-
ferences between diﬀerent populations of secondary and
tertiary γ′ precipitates, and morphology diﬀerences be-
tween the γ′ distributions associated with their diﬀerent
lattice misﬁt strains during their formation.
Chemical
ﬂuctuations were also observed in the γ matrix as a func-
tion of distance from secondary γ′ precipitates.
