Electron coupling to intra- and inter-molecular vibrational modes is investigated in models ap-
propriate to single crystal organic semiconductors, such as oligoacenes. Focus is on spectral and
transport properties of these systems beyond perturbative approaches. The interplay between dif-
ferent couplings strongly aﬀects the temperature band renormalization that is the result of a subtle
equilibrium between opposite tendencies: band narrowing due to interaction with local modes, band
widening due to electron coupling to non local modes. The model provides an accurate description
of the mobility as function of temperature: indeed, it has the correct order of magnitude, at low
temperatures, it scales as a power-law T −δ with the exponent δ larger than unity, and, at high
temperatures, shows an hopping behavior with a small activation energy.

INTRODUCTION
In the last years, the availability of single crystal
organic ﬁeld-eﬀect (OFET) transistors has represented
a step forward in the ﬁeld of plastic electronics since
these systems show a charge mobility at least one or-
der of magnitude larger than that of thin ﬁlms.1 Among
them, the most promising and studied are those based
on oligoacenes, such as pentacene and rubrene.2
Although the transport properties in the linear regime
have been carefully extracted by studying clean single
crystal OFET devices, the intrinsic transport mechanism
acting in organic semiconductors (OS) is, up to now, not
fully understood. Typically, in these materials, the in-
duced doping is not very high (typically much smaller
than one charge carrier for ten molecules), so that the
mobility is analyzed in transport measurements. At tem-
peratures close or higher than 100K, the mobility µp of
these systems exhibits a power-law behavior (µp ∼T −δ,
with δ ≃2),2–4 which cannot be simply ascribed to band
transport.5 Moreover, in some systems, starting from
room temperature, there is a crossover from band-like
to activated hopping behavior.6 For example, in naph-
thalene and anthracene, along the a and b axis, there is
a change in the temperature behavior of mobility, and,
along the c axis, an activated regime takes place with a
small activated gap of the order of 20meV .7 Moreover, in
pentacene, above room temperature, the mobility shows
an upturn with increasing temperature.2
Recently, many photoemission experiments have been
performed in pentacene and rubrene.8–11 The quasi-
particle energy dispersion does not exhibit a strong mass
renormalization indicating moderate values of electron-
phonon (el-ph) coupling. For pentacene, the band struc-
ture is reduced only by about 15% going from 75K to
300K.
Typically, the crossover from tunneling to hopping be-
havior observed in transport properties is ascribed to
the formation of local polarons,12,13 and described with
the simplest model for molecular crystals, the Holstein
model.14,15 The modeling assumes that the most rele-
vant carrier interaction is with local modes whose fre-
quency is lower than the typical hopping energy.12,13
The used approaches only generalize the previous treat-
ment of Holstein works,14,15 starting from the question-
able limit of narrow electronic band even for the coupling
to low-frequency modes. Actually, recent results, based
on the adiabatic approach for the vibrational modes, have
pointed out that, up to room temperature, within a pa-
rameter range valid for many oligoacenes, polaronic ef-
fects do not play a prominent role if low frequency modes
are excited in the Holstein model.16
Recent ab-initio calculations have evidenced that
charge carriers are mostly coupled to intra-molecular
modes with high frequency.
Moreover, it has been
found that another very relevant interaction is with inter-
molecular modes with low frequency in comparison with
typical electron hoppings.6,17 Another important result
is that the reorganization energy (related to the polaron
binding energy) decreases with increasing the number of
benzene rings in oligoacenes (for example, going from
naphthalene to pentacene).
In view of ab-initio results, Holstein-Peierls models
have been considered for the description of OS,18–20 mod-
elling the carrier interaction with low-frequency inter-
molecular modes via a modulation of the transfer hop-
ping.
Three dimensional models have been mainly
applied to naphtalene.18 One-dimensional models sim-
ilar to Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger (SSH) model21 have been
introduced to study the OS along the relevant stack
direction.22–25 These models treat the inter-molecular
modes as classical exploiting their low energy in compar-
ison with the electronic hopping scale. The approaches
are non perturbative in the electron-phonon coupling.
The mobility is quite well described at low temperatures
showing a robust power-law T −δ. However, the power-
law behavior extends up to high T and there is no sign
of upturn in the mobility as function of temperature.
Aim of this work is to clarify the eﬀects of electron
coupling to intra- and inter-molecular vibrational modes
on the transport properties of prototype single crystal
OS, such as oligoacenes. To this aim, a one-dimensional
model with coupling to intra- and inter-molecular modes
has been analyzed. We will show that the interplay be-2
tween local and non local el-ph interactions is able to
provide a very accurate description of the mobility and
to shed light on the intricate mechanism of band narrow-
ing with increasing temperature.

MODEL
We consider a one-dimensional model with coupling to
intra- and inter-molecular modes similar to one recently
introduced, where the treatment only concerns the study
of spectral properties.26 The coupling to intra-molecular
modes is Holstein-like, that to inter-molecular modes is
SSH-like. It can be summarized in the following hamil-
tonian:
H = H(0)
el +H(0)
Intra+H(0)
Inter+Hel−Intra+Hel−Inter. (1)

where t is the bare electron hopping between the near-

i and ci are the charge
carrier creation and annihilation operators, respectively,
relative to the site i of a chain with lattice parame-
ter a.
For the transfer hopping the ab-initio estimate
is: t ≃50 −100meV .6 We consider a single-band one-
dimensional electronic structure since it represents the
simplest eﬀective model in the anisotropic OS to ana-
lyze the low energy features responsible for the mobility
properties.

local modes, we ﬁx yi = zInter,i; for local modes, xi =
zIntra,i and pi = rIntra,i. The inter-molecular modes are
characterized by small frequencies (ℏωInter ≃5−10meV )
in comparison with the transfer hopping.6,22 On the con-
trary, the most coupled intra-molecular modes have large
frequencies (ℏωIntra ≃130 −180meV ).6

In
the adiabatic regime for non local modes (ℏωInter ≪t),
the dimensionless quantity λInter = α2
Inter/4kIntert fully
provides the strength of the electron coupling to inter-
molecular modes. The typical values of λ are in the in-
termediate coupling regime (of the order of or less than
0.1).
In the following, we will use units such that lattice pa-
rameter a = 1, Planck constant ℏ= 1, Boltzmann con-
stant kB = 1, and electron charge e = 1. We will analyze
systems with chain size L = 32 (where the system reaches
the thermodynamic limit) and we will measure energies
in units of t ≃80meV . We ﬁx ωIntra = 2.0 as the highest
energy scale.6 For the calculation of dynamic quantities,
an additional small broadening Γ is introduced in order
to simulate the eﬀect of a tiny disorder. We ﬁx Γ = 0.05t,
therefore it is the smallest energy scale. The results at
low temperatures are only slightly dependent on the value
of Γ.
III.
METHOD
Since a very low carrier density is injected into OS, we
will study the case of a single particle.
The temperature range where intrinsic eﬀects are rele-
vant is ωInter ≤T ≪t < ωIntra. Therefore, the dynam-
ics of intermolecular modes is assumed classical. Actu-
ally, the electron dynamics is strongly inﬂuenced by the
statistical ”oﬀdiagonal” disorder, that, in the limit of low
carrier density, is described by the probability function
P ({yi}) of free classical harmonic oscillators:

At a ﬁxed conﬁguration of non local displacements
{yi}, Eq. (1) is equivalent to a Holstein model, where the
electron hopping between nearest neighbor sites is not ho-
mogeneous and depend on the speciﬁc pair (see Eq.(5)).
The resulting inhomogeneous Holstein model can be ac-
curately studied within the modiﬁed Lang-Firsov ap-
proach via a unitary transformation U, provided that the
system is in the anti-adiabatic regime (ωIntra > t), where
the quantum nature of phonons cannot be neglected.27,28
The electron is renormalized by the coupling with local
modes increasing its mass, and the oscillators are dis-
placed from their equilibrium position to a distance pro-
portional to the el-ph interaction. In our case, the new
Hamiltonian ˜H = U −1HU is built through the varia-3

represents the term giving the reduction of the bond hop-
ping, with N0 = 1/(eβωIntra −1) Bose distribution of the
local modes. The distribution of fi values depends on
the distribution P ({yi}). For example, close to T = 0.5t,
the deviations of fi from the average value can become
of the order of twenty per cent in the parameter regime
investigated in this work. For strong el-ph coupling and
high temperatures, the values of fi are close to one (Ti,i+1
large), meaning that the system is characterized by small
polaron behavior and an incoherent hopping dynamics.
For intermediate el-ph coupling and low temperatures,
the distribution of fi can have an average smaller than
unity. This implies that there is a possibility of tunnel-
ing dynamics with a renormalized bandwidth (Ti,i+1 not
large).
At ﬁxed conﬁguration {yj}, one has to diagonalize
˜Heff yielding L eigenvalues En and eigenvector compo-
nents bj(n), with j = 1, .., L. In this paper, we will focus
on the density of states D(ω) ({yj}):

Another central quantity of this work is the mobility
as function of the temperature. At ﬁxed conﬁguration
{yj}, the mobility µ ({yj}) of the inhomogeneous Hol-
stein model is determined starting from the real part of
the conductivity Re[σ(ω)] ({yj}), taking the limit of zero
frequency and dividing for the single particle density 1/L
of the system. In the linear regime, the real part of the
conductivity is derived from the Kubo formula29

With the ﬁrst term of the previous equation, one can
build up the coherent part of conductivity, where the
charge transfer is not accompanied by processes changing
the number of phonons. With the second term, retaining
only the main autocorrelation contribution j = j1, one
gets the incoherent part of the conductivity, which takes
into account inelastic scattering processes of emission and
absorption of phonons.30

ﬁrst one makes the average over the eigenstates and

by means of a Monte-Carlo procedure. Actually, we gen-
erate a sequence of random numbers distributed accord-
ing to P ({yi}). For the systems investigated in this pa-
per, a few thousands of iterations are suﬃcient to get a
good accuracy even for dynamic quantities.
The method exposed above is very accurate in the
regime ωInter ≪t and ωIntra > t appropriate to OS. It
properly takes into account the quantum eﬀects of high
frequency local vibrational modes.
Moreover, the ap-
proach is able to include spatial correlations relevant in
quasi one-dimensional systems, in particular vertex cor-
rections in the calculation of mobility.

values of local coupling gIntra. In the inset, the density of
states D as a function of the frequency at T = 0 for diﬀerent
values of local coupling gIntra.
First, we analyze the case λInter = 0. In Fig. 1, we
report the mobility with varying the values of gIntra.
For weak gIntra, a coherent behavior is present with a
power-law of the order of 1/T at low temperature. As ex-
pected, with increasing gIntra, there is a crossover from
tunneling to hopping behavior due to the formation of
localized small polarons. That occurs at temperatures
slightly larger than 0.5t for gIntra = 1.3. For large values
of gIntra, the low temperature power-law part is strongly
reduced and the activated behavior is followed by the
residual scattering regime at very high T .29
In the variational approach, the crossover from band-
like to hopping regime is marked by the value f = 1 on
all the sites. However, in the intermediate regime (for
example gIntra = 1.3), at temperatures characterized by
a metallic behavior, the calculation provides values of f
smaller than unity (f of the order of 0.6) suggesting that
the tunneling regime is reduced but still present. More-
over, at higher temperatures, where f = 1 is recovered,
the activated gap ∆in the hopping mobility is not very
large: ∆≃0.54t.
In the inset of Fig. 1, we report the density of states at
T = 0 for the same values of gIntra of the main ﬁgure. As
expected, with increasing gIntra, there is a reduction of
the fundamental polaronic band with a transfer of spec-
tral weight to high satellite bands appearing at multiples
of the vibrational frequency ωIntra.29

diﬀerent temperatures at λInter = 0.09 and gIntra = 1.3.
The description of mobility based only on the intra-
molecular mode electron coupling fails for two reasons in
the comparison with low temperature experiments. First,
it does not provide large values of the mobility (expressed
in our natural units, that is in terms of µ0 = ea2/ℏ≃
7cm2/(V ·s), taking a = 7˚A6). For example, at T = 0.31t
(room temperature), µ is less than 0.5µ0 for gIntra = 1.3.
Then, the low temperature mobility due local coupling
scales as 1/T .
The next step is to combine the eﬀects of high fre-
quency local vibrational modes with non local low fre-
quency ones. These non local modes are considered as
relevant for the description of the mobility up to room
temperature.
Actually, for rubrene, the carrier mobil-
ity is dominated by inter-molecular phonons (the non
local coupling is estimated to be in the intermediate
regime λInter ≃0.09) since the interaction with the intra-
molecular modes is almost negligible (gIntra ≃0.7).31 In
pentacene, the coupling with local modes is of the same
order of that in rubrene.6 For these materials, our ap-
proach, being the local el-ph coupling perturbative, pre-
dicts a slight reduction of mobility in agreement with
results present in the literature.31 On the other hand,
going from pentacene to naphthalene, the reorganization
energy nearly increases twice suggesting a much stronger
coupling with local modes.6 Therefore, for systems with
reduced number of benzene rings like naphthalene, we ex-5
pect a larger interplay between intra- and inter-molecular
modes within the intermediate el-ph coupling regime for
both modes.
In Fig.
2, we report the density of states D for
gIntra = 1.3 and λInter = 0.09 at diﬀerent temperatures.
At T = 0, where the eﬀect of non local modes is weak,
the lowest band is strongly renormalized at lower ener-
gies and becomes narrower (about half of the bare band).
The intrisic reduction of the bare band provides a simple
and direct explanation of the diﬀerence in the bandwidth
evidenced in the series of oligoacenes from naphthalene
(eﬀective band of the order of 40meV ) to pentacene (ef-
fective band of the order of 80meV ). Indeed, it can be
ascribed to the decrease of the reorganization energy that
in turn reduces the renormalization eﬀects.6

FIG. 3. Mobility and its diﬀerent contributions as function
of the temperature. In the inset, the mobility as function of
temperature for diﬀerent values of gIntra. For comparison,
the behavior with δ = 2 is shown.
At ﬁnite temperature, the shape of the spectra is
changed due to the non local coupling.
Actually, any
band shows a new small maximum due to the coupling
to inter-molecular modes. Moreover, the band narrow-
ing is strongly reduced in the presence of non local cou-
pling. In order to clarify this point, we notice that, for
λInter = 0, the principal band at T = 0.35 is reduced of
about 42% of the band at T = 0. On the other hand,
for λInter = 0.09, the principal band at T = 0.35 is re-
duced of only 7% of the band at T = 0. The narrowing
of the principal band results from a subtle equilibrium
between the two opposite tendencies. Actually, the cou-
pling to non local modes has the main eﬀect to induce
scattering into the single bands of the density of states,
preventing the narrowing induced by the coupling to lo-
cal modes. The interplay between local and non local
modes is able to produce a modest narrowing as function
of the temperature even if the coupling to local modes
is not weak. Our prediction is that this eﬀect should be
present not only in pentacene,10 but also in naphthalene
and anthracene.
Finally, we analyze the mobility in the intermediate
regime (see Fig. 3). As shown in the previous section,
the mobility can be divided into two contributions30: the
coherent, where the scattering of the renormalized elec-
tron (the only eﬀect due local el-ph coupling is here the
reduction of the bandwidth) with non local modes is in-
cluded, and the incoherent one, where, in addition to non
local modes, scattering with multiple real local phonons
is considered. The ﬁrst term, relevant at low tempera-
tures, bears a strong resemblance with the mobility of the
system at gIntra = 0, even if, as expected, it is smaller.
The incoherent term starts at a temperature of about
T = 0.25 and becomes predominant at higher tempera-
tures. Actually, the coherent term only decreases with
temperature even if the electron dynamics becomes in-
coherent. The role of the local coupling is to promote
an activated behavior in the incoherent regime. The co-
operative eﬀect is able to provide an activation energy
∆of about 0.25t, therefore less than one half of that
for λInter = 0 and close to that extracted by the data
in naphthalene.7 Moreover, the upturn in the mobility
starts at lower temperatures in comparison with the case
λInter = 0.
The local coupling is able to aﬀect but to not de-
stroy the low temperature behavior dominated by the
non local coupling.
In the inset of Fig.
3, we report
the low temperature mobility in logarithmic scale. Actu-
ally, for gIntra = 0, the mobility scales as 1/T 1.89, while,
with increasing gIntra, the power-law becomes slightly
less pronounced.
In the case gIntra = 1.3, the mobil-
ity goes as 1/T 1.60, still compatible with experiments in
naphthalene.7
In summary, the proposed model is able to capture
many features of the mobility in oligoacenes. First of all,
it has the correct order of magnitude: for T = 200K
(T
≃0.2t), µ ≃1.5µ0 ≃10cm2/(V · s), while at
T = 100K (T ≃0.1t), µ ≃4µ0 ≃28cm2/(V · s). These
values compare favorably with mobility measurements in
naphthalene: for T = 200K, µ ≃4cm2/(V · s) in the
hole channel and µ ≃1cm2/(V · s) in the electron chan-
nel, while at T = 100K, µ ≃20cm2/(V · s) in the hole
channel and µ ≃3cm2/(V · s) in the electron channel.7
At low temperatures, the mobility scales as a power-law
T −δ with the exponent δ ≃1.6 larger than unity even if
an intermediate el-ph coupling to local modes is present.
Starting from room temperature, the incoherent contri-
bution of mobility begins increasing. At high temper-
atures, the mobility shows an hopping behavior with a
small activation energy. The theory is intended to de-
scribe the mobility in the direction where it has the max-
imum value. Typically, this corresponds to a direction
into the growth plane of the OFET on the substrate.2
The study of mobility in the other in-plane direction and
out of plane is out of the aim of this study.6
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The interplay between local and non local el-ph cou-
plings strongly aﬀects the band narrowing and the mobil-
ity as function of the temperature. The band narrowing
has a polaronic origin but it is strongly dependent on
the non local el-ph coupling. In the intermediate cou-
pling regime of the electron with both intra- and inter-
molecular modes, the mobility scales as a power-law T −δ
at low temperatures, and it is characterized by hopping
behavior with a small activation energy at high temper-
atures. We believe that the main conclusions will not be
qualitatively modiﬁed by the inclusion of more realistic
lattice structures and interactions since the results rely
on general features of diﬀerent types of el-ph coupling.
The next step will be to investigate the eﬀect of traps
on the low temperature mobility generalizing the model
presented in this work.
