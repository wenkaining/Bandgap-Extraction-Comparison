In this work, we address modal parameter ﬂuctuations in statistical distributions describing
charge-to-breakdown (QBD) and/or time-to-breakdown (tBD) during the dielectric breakdown
regime of ultra-thin oxides, which are of high interest for the advancement of electronic technol-
ogy. We reobtain a generalized Weibull distribution (q-Weibull), which properly describes (tBD)
data when oxide thickness ﬂuctuations are present, in order to improve reliability assessment of
ultra-thin oxides by time-to-breakdown (tBD) extrapolation and area scaling. The incorporation
of ﬂuctuations allows a physical interpretation of the q-Weibull distribution in connection with
the Tsallis statistics. In support to our results, we analyze tBD data of SiO2-based MOS devices
obtained experimentally and theoretically through a percolation model, demonstrating an advanta-
geous description of the dielectric breakdown by the q-Weibull distribution.

INTRODUCTION
The International Technology Roadmap for Semicon-
ductors indicates the need to decrease the SiO2 gate
thickness to less than 3 nm to pursue the continuity of
the Moore’s Law [1]. Research eﬀorts to maintain this
trend have been focusing on: (i) the advantageous sub-
stitution of SiO2 by high dielectric constant materials to
allow equivalent gate dielectric oxide thickness bellow 1
nm [2]; (ii) a better understanding of the fractal regime
of ultra-thin gate dielectric oxide growth, where spatial
inhomogeneities or ﬂuctuations are important [3, 4] con-
siderations for the control of dielectric breakdown condi-
tions. Consequently, the reliability of ultra-thin oxides
for ultra-large scale integration is one of the most impor-
tant concerns in the domain of electronics miniaturiza-
tion nowadays [5, 6, 7].
Two quantities which are experimentally measured
to assess the reliability of a metal-oxide-semiconductor
(MOS) device are: the charge-to-breakdown QBD, de-
ﬁned as the time-integrated current density which ﬂows
until breakdown occurs, and the time-to-breakdown
tBD, deﬁned as the samples’ lifetime.
These quan-
tities are statistically distributed and are usually as-
sumed to be Weibull distributed [8].
In particular,
accurate assessment of reliability of ultra-thin oxides
is seriously aﬀected by ﬂuctuations of oxide thickness.
These ﬂuctuations cause a deviation from the Weibull
distribution, which is easily observed by a curvature
in a graph of ln[−ln[1 −F(t)]] versus ln[t], being
F(t) =
R t
0 P(x)dx the cumulative distribution. Extrap-
olation of the slope of this plot from higher failure per-
centiles to lower failure percentiles can lead to serious
errors in reliability assessment, as shown by Wu et al.
[5].
Deviations from a given distribution can be generated
by taking scale mixtures of it [9]. For instance, the scale
parameter of the exponential and Gaussian distributions
can be averaged by a gamma distribution. In these two
cases, the deviation induced by the ﬂuctuation in this pa-
rameter has been successfully employed in the description
of physical situations, such as those related with nonex-
ponential decay [10, 11] and turbulence [12, 13]. Further-
more, this average process has also been connected with
the entropic parameter q in the context of Tsallis statis-
tics [10, 11, 12]. By taking the ﬂuctuations of the modal
parameter of the Weibull distribution into account, we
obtain a generalized Weibull distribution which properly
describes tBD data when oxide ﬂuctuations are present,
thus improving reliability assessment of ultra-thin oxides
by tBD extrapolation and area scaling. This generalized
Weibull distribution, without focusing ﬂuctuations, was
discussed and applied in Ref. [14] to other systems.
In the following section we present the generalized
Weibull distribution employed here. The application of
this distribution to the description of the dielectric break-
down in oxides is considered in section 3. The last section
is dedicated to our conclusions.2

q-WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION
The Weibull distribution often used in the statistical
description in the study of the time-to-breakdown in elec-
tronic devices [15] is given by

β−1

,
(1)
where the parameter x0 is the modal value that corre-
sponds to 63, 2% of the samples’ lifetime. The parameter
β is the Weibull slope and deﬁnes the time-to-breakdown
spreading degree.
In order to incorporate the referred
ﬂuctuation, we consider a Weibull compound distribu-
tion p(x; θ) = βθxβ−1 exp(−θxβ). Here, θ = x−β
0 , with
β ﬁxed and x0 changing so that the new parameter θ
is a stochastic variable ruled by the gamma probability
density function

and expq′(−a x) ≡0 if 1 −(1 −q′) a x < 0, with
q′ = (2 + r)/(1 + r) and ˜xβ
0 = [δ/(r + 1)].
By comparing Eq.(1) with Eq.(5) we verify that Pq′(x)
is a generalization of the Weibull distribution in the same
sense that the q-exponential function generalizes the ex-
ponential one. In view of this observation and following
Ref. [14], we refer to Pq′(x) as q-Weibull distribution. We
also remark that Pq′(x) contains a broad class of distri-
butions as particular cases. In fact, in the limit q′ →1 it
reduces to the Weibull distribution, for β →1 it gives the
q-exponential distribution, and when q′ →1 and β →1
it becomes the exponential distribution.
Furthermore,
from Eq.(4) we verify two power law regimes, one for
small x, xβ−1, and another for large x, x−(1+rβ). Notice
also that R ∞
0
Pq′(x)dx exists and is equal to one when
q′ < 2.
Before addressing our discussion to the application of
the q-Weibull distribution concerning experimental and
simulation results, we give a connection of this distri-
bution with the Tsallis statistics.
The ﬁrst step to-
wards verifying this connection is based on the fact that
the q-exponential can be viewed as a signature of the
Tsallis statistics, since it basically replaces the exponen-
tial in the canonical distribution.
In fact, this canon-
ical distribution is obtained when the Tsallis entropy
Sq ≡(1 −PW
i=1 pq
i )/(1 −q) is maximized subjected to
appropriate constraints [17]. Here, pi is the probability
of the ith state, W is the number of accessible states,
and q is a real parameter that rules the degree of gener-
alization of the theory (when q →1 we recover the usual
entropy).
On the other hand, the q-exponential func-
tion can be obtained from the average of the exponential
function by using the gamma distribution, Eq. (2) [18].
Thus, the parameter q occurring in the Tsallis statistics
is shown to be entirely induced by the ﬂuctuations of the
parameter of the usual exponential distribution [10]. Fol-
lowing this interpretation, the average process employed
to obtain Pq′(x) characterizes an implicit connection with
the Tsallis statistics.
III.
APPLICATION TO DIELECTRIC
BREAKDOWN
To apply our distribution, Eq. (5), to investigate ex-
perimental and numerical simulated data, we consider
the cumulative distribution for Pq′(x), i.e.,
Fq(t) = 1 −expq
"
−
 t
α
β#
,
(6)
with q = 1/(2−q′) and α = ˜x0/(2−q′)1/β. In connection
with the q-exponential function, the q-logarithm function
is usually deﬁned as [17]
lnq(x) ≡x1−q −1
1 −q
,
(7)
thus lnq[expq(x)] = expq[lnq(x)] = x. By using Eq. (6),
we obtain that the graph of ln[−lnq(1 −Fq(t))] versus
ln(t) gives a straight line since
ln[−lnq[1 −Fq(t)]] = β ln(t) −β ln(α).
(8)
Therefore, if a cumulative distribution relative to the di-
electric breakdown for a given set of data, F d(t), is well
described by the q-Weibull distribution, then the q pa-
rameter present in the q-logarithm is obtained through a
linear adjustment, and the parameter β is the slope of the
graph. This procedure introduced here will be referred
as a q-Weibull plot.
To compare the usefulness of the Weibull and the q-
Weibull distributions, we analyze experimental [19] and
simulation results. Figure 1(a), which is adapted from
the work of Wu et al. [5], shows a curvature in a graph
ln[−ln[1 −F(t)]] versus ln[t]. The variation of this slope
is associated with oxide thickness ﬂuctuations. In fact,
Wu et al. [5] were able to generate this slope variation
by performing simulations in which the oxide thickness4
obeyed a Gaussian distribution.
Extrapolation of the
slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles (conven-
tional experimental window) to lower failure percentiles
leads to an error in tBD projection and, consequently,
in projection of reliability. It is necessary to use large
and time-consuming sample sizes (thousands of devices)
in order to obtain tBD distributions down to lower per-
centiles and avoid erroneous projections. The same tBD
data can be correctly ﬁtted in the entire range of per-
centiles by the q-Weibull distribution, as shown in Fig.
1(b). In the q-Weibull plot, the data follow a straight
line.
We conclude that, by taking the ﬂuctuations of
the modal parameter of the Weibull distribution into ac-
count, one obtains a statistical distribution which com-
pletely describes tBD data when oxide ﬂuctuations are
present. Therefore, the q-Weibull distribution allows im-
proved tBD projection for ultra-thin oxides and does not
require a very large number of samples, i.e., correct tBD
extrapolation can be performed in the conventional ex-
perimental window. This is a striking beneﬁt brought by
the q-Weibull distribution.
In addition to correct tBD projection, we have found
that the q-Weibull also improves area scaling, another
important consideration for reliability studies [15].
In
Fig. 2(a), we have used the data from the work of Ter-
amoto et al.
[20].
They studied the time-dependent
dielectric breakdown for 6.9 nm thin SiO2 oxides with
samples areas of 10−4 and 10−5 mm2, and subjected to
a EOx = 12.7 MV/cm applied ﬁeld.
It is clear, when
comparing Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), that the q-Weibull
distribution gives a better area scaling than the Weibull
one, another remarkable beneﬁt.
When tBD data are plotted in a limited range of per-
centiles, the diﬀerences between the q-Weibull and the
Weibull distributions become less apparent, but can still
be seen.
As an example, we consider the simulations
performed by Sombra et al. [21]. They developed a per-
colation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a
MOS capacitor investigating eﬀects of bias polarity, ox-
ide ﬁlm thickness and electric ﬁeld strength.
The hot
electron injection is either through the gate or the sub-
strate. In Fig. 3(a) we have performed a linear ﬁt of the
simulation data of Sombra [21] with the Weibull distri-
bution, while in Fig. 3(b) we depict the same data but
with a linear ﬁt through the q-Weibull distribution. One
can see once more that the q-Weibull distribution gives a
better ﬁt than the Weibull one, for small and large tBD.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we conclude that: (i) ﬂuctuation on the
modal value is a mechanism to explain deviations from
the Weibull distribution in reliability studies of electron-
ics devices; (ii) this ﬂuctuation leads to a generalization
of the Weibull distribution (q-Weibull distribution) and a
connection with the Tsallis statistics; and (iii) the gener-
alized Weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment
of experimental and simulated data in comparison with
the Weibull one, giving improved tBD extrapolation and
area scaling. Finally, the results presented here can be
very useful for an improved description of the dielectric
breakdown in the high dielectric constant materials [2]
which will be present in future generations of advanced
MOS devices.
