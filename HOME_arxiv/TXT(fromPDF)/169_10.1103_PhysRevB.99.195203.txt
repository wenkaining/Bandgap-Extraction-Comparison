The carrier dynamics and electronic structures of type-II Weyl semimetal candidates MoTe2 and
WTe2 have been investigated by using temperature-dependent optical conductivity [σ(ω)] spectra.
Two kinds of Drude peaks (narrow and broad) have been separately observed. The width of the
broad Drude peak increases with elevating temperature above the Debye temperature of about 130 K
in the same way as those of normal metals, on the other hand, the narrow Drude peak becomes
visible below 80 K and the width is rapidly suppressed with decreasing temperature. Because the
temperature dependence of the narrow Drude peak is similar to that of a type-I Weyl semimetal
TaAs, it was concluded to originate from Dirac carriers of Weyl bands. The result suggests that the
conductance has the contribution of two kinds of carriers, normal semimetallic and Dirac carriers,
and this observation is an evidence of type-II Weyl semimetals of MoTe2 and WTe2. The obtained
carrier mass of the semimetallic bands and the interband transition spectra suggest the weak electron
correlation eﬀect in both materials.

INTRODUCTION
Materials with linear band dispersions at the Fermi
level (EF) such as surface states of topological insulators
and Dirac semimetals have been recently attracting at-
tention because the very high mobility as well as high
speed devices are expected thanks to the very low eﬀec-
tive carrier mass of the linear band dispersion. In the
case of the space- or time-reversal symmetry breaking of
Dirac semimetals, the spin degeneracy of the Dirac band
is released in the momentum space, resulting in forming
two Dirac bands with diﬀerent spin directions at the sym-
metry points with respect to high symmetry axes. These
materials are named as Weyl semimetals.
Weyl semimetals are classed in two groups by the shape
of the Fermi surface. One named type-I exhibits point-
like Fermi surfaces owing to Lorentz invariant band struc-
tures, and another named type-II has tilted Weyl cones
appearing between electron and hole Fermi surfaces. 1T ′-
MoTe2 and 1T ′-WTe2 of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMD) are candidates of the type-II Weyl semimetals1,2.
TMD forms four crystal structures, namely 2H, 1T , 1T ′,
and Td. Theoretical predictions are that MoTe2 is a semi-
conductor in 2H and 1T forms and the electronic struc-
ture has been revealed by optical measurements3–5, on
the other hand, that in 1T ′ and Td forms is predicted as
a semimetal6.
MoTe2 with monoclinic β structure (P21m, No. 11) at
room temperature is regarded as a trivial metal, however,
it has a phase transition at about 240 K with structure
change to orthorhombic 1T ′ structure (Pmn21, No. 31).
The 1T ′-MoTe2 (this is denoted as MoTe2 hereafter) is
believed to be a putative Weyl semimetal7.
MoTe2 is
attracting attention owing to the appearance of super-
conductivity at the temperatures of 0.1 K at ambient
pressure and of 8.2 K at 11.7 GPa8. Mo1−xNbxTe2 has
anomalous enhancement of thermopower near the critical
region between the polar and nonpolar metallic phases9.
It is under debate whether these properties are related
to the Weyl semimetallic band structure or not.
WTe2
also
has
orthorhombic
crystal
structure
(Pmn21) below room temperature.
This material has
a large positive magnetoresistance10, and the electron
and hole Fermi surfaces are the same size, which is con-
sistent with other normal semimetals11. In addition to
the quadratic magnetoresistance, a ﬁeld-linear Nernst re-
sponse distinguishes WTe2 from other dilute metals11.
Since both of MoTe2 and WTe2 have been theoret-
ically predicted to be type-II Weyl semimetals1,12, the
investigation of the relation of the electronic structures
to interesting physical properties of these materials is im-
portant and has been performed so far by using angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)13–26 and
quantum oscillation measurements7,11,27–30.
All mea-
surements pointed out that electron and hole bands com-
monly exist on EF. By surface-sensitive ARPES mea-
surements, Fermi arc surface electronic states have been
also observed.
The origin of the Fermi arcs has been
concluded to be the existence of Weyl points in many ex-
periments, but another opinion is also present24, so the
origin is still under debate.
The evidence of the existence of Weyl points can be
observed in optical conductivity [σ(ω)] spectra. For in-
stance, in the σ(ω) spectra of TaAs, which is one of
type-I Weyl semimetals, the rapid decrease of the Drude
width and the decrease of the Drude weight with de-
creasing temperature have been observed31,32. In normal
semimetals, because carriers are mainly scattered by lat-
tice vibrations, the electrical resistivity as well as the
scattering rate γ linearly increases with increasing tem-
perature above the Debye temperature33. On the other
hand, carriers at Weyl points have diﬀerent temperature-
dependent γ from normal metals owing to the increase of
mobility µ (γ ∝1/µ) at low temperatures31,34. There-2
fore, the temperature dependence of γ is one of important
indices to judge the existence of Dirac electrons of Weyl
semimallic bands.
So far, temperature-dependent σ(ω) spectra of WTe2
have been reported by Homes et al.35. In the paper, ow-
ing to the model of existence of two kinds of carriers as-
sumed as electrons and holes included in the Drude anal-
ysis, one of γ, which is equal to inverse relaxation time,
becomes very small at low temperatures. They have sug-
gested that the carriers are related to the extremely large
nonsaturating magnetoresistance, but they have not dis-
cussed the existence of Weyl electrons. The anisotropic
σ(ω) spectra of WTe2 in the ab plane have been reported,
and the interband spectra can be well explained by ab ini-
tio band calculations36. On the other hand, even though
the optical spectra of 2H-MoTe2 have been reported pre-
viously3–5, the optical spectra of 1T ′-MoTe2 have never
been reported with our full knowledge.
In this paper, we report optical spectra of MoTe2 and
WTe2, in which the evidence of Weyl electrons commonly
appears in both materials. As a result, the character of
Weyl electrons can be identiﬁed by the analysis with the
combination of two Drude curves, namely narrow and
broad Drude components.
The γ value of the narrow
Drude component is strongly suppressed at low temper-
atures, which is similar to that of a type-I Weyl semimetal
TaAs, suggesting the existence of Weyl electrons.
In
addition, the electron correlation is discussed using the
comparison of the experimentally obtained σ(ω) spectra
with band calculations and calculated σ(ω) spectra.

EXPERIMENTAL
High-quality single-crystalline MoTe2 and WTe2 sam-
ples with the size of about 2 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm3 were syn-
thesized by a self-ﬂux method.
One of our samples,
WTe2, shows a large residual resistivity ratio of 1330 and
very large magneto-resistance with obvious Shubnikov-
de Haas oscillation37,38.
As-grown surfaces were mea-
sured for the optical reﬂectivity [R(ω)] spectra. Near-
normal incident R(ω) spectra were acquired in a wide
photon-energy range of 3 meV–30 eV to ensure accu-
rate Kramers-Kronig analysis (KKA)39. Michelson-type
and Martin-Puplett-type rapid-scan Fourier spectrome-
ters were used at the photon energy ℏω regions of 8 meV–
1.5 eV and 3–20 meV, respectively, with a feed-back po-
sitioning system to maintain the overall uncertainty level
less than ±0.5 % in the temperature range of 10–300 K40.
To obtain the absolute R(ω) values, in-situ evapora-
tion method was adopted. The obtained temperature-
dependent R(ω) spectra of MoTe2 and WTe2 are shown
in Fig. 1. We could not recognize the structural phase
transition of MoTe2 at about 250 K by the R(ω) spectra.
This suggests that the change of the electronic structure
is very small. In the photon energy range of 1.2–30 eV,
the R(ω) spectrum was only measured at room tempera-
ture by using synchrotron radiation, and connected to the

spectra for ℏω ≤1.5 eV for the KKA. All measurements
were performed along the ab-plane. In order to obtain
σ(ω) spectra via KKA of R(ω) spectra, the R(ω) spectra
were extrapolated below 3 meV with a Hagen-Rubens
function, and above 30 eV with a free-electron approxi-
mation R(ω) ∝ω−441. The obtained σ(ω) spectra were
compared with the spectra derived from LDA band struc-
ture calculations including spin-orbit coupling using the
Wien2k code42.
Lattice parameters of MoTe212 and
WTe243 with 1T ′ crystal structure were adopted.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Comparison with band calculations
Figure 2 indicates the band dispersions and densities
of states (DOS) of MoTe2 and WTe2. Both materials are
semimetals because electron and hole bands cross EF at
around the Γ point. This result is consistent with the
previously reported band calculations12,44. Weyl points
are located near the symmetry line of Γ −X (not shown
in the ﬁgure). In comparison between MoTe2 and WTe2,
the dispersion curves are similar to each other, but both
occupied and unoccupied states of MoTe2 are closer to
EF than those of WTe2, which can be also seen in DOS.
A peak at about 0.4 eV from EF of WTe2 shifts to about
0.2 eV in MoTe2. This causes an increase in DOS for
MoTe2 at around EF, i.e., the carrier density of MoTe23

is expected to be higher than that of WTe2.
Calculated σ(ω) spectra obtained from band calcula-
tions in Fig. 2a in comparison with experimental ones
are indicated in Fig. 3. The experimental σ(ω) spectra
in the ab-plane have been obtained using non-polarized
light, so the spectra are compared with the average spec-
tra [(σxx+σyy)/2] of σxx and σyy along the a- and b-axes,
respectively. It should be noted that Drude structures
appear in the experimental spectra in the photon energy
region below 50 meV due to the existence of carriers, but
it cannot be reproduced by the band calculations owing
to no information on scattering rate. In WTe2, the exper-
imental spectrum below the photon energy of 500 meV
has been compared with the DFT-calculated spectrum
by Homes et al.35, and also with the DFT+U calcula-
tion involving electron correlation (U = 2 eV)21. The
latter provides better agreement with the experimental
spectrum.
In the present data, even though the calculation
without electron correlation has been performed, the
spectrum below 500 meV, especially peaks at around

100 meV, seems to reproduce the experimental spectrum.
However, a peak at ℏω = 550 meV in MoTe2 and two
peaks at 300 and 600 meV in WTe2 in the experimental
spectra cannot be reproduced by our calculation. There
are peaks at 750 meV in MoTe2 and at 400 and 800 meV
in WTe2 in the calculated spectra. If these peaks in the
calculated spectra are regarded to move to the experi-
mental peaks by a self-energy eﬀect owing to an elec-
tron correlation45, the renormalization factor z can be
evaluated as ∼0.73 in MoTe2 and ∼0.75 in WTe2,
which are almost consistent with each other. These val-
ues are larger (this means smaller electron correlation)
than those of normal heavy fermion compounds46, but
are similar to that of a valence ﬂuctuation material YbAl2
(the Kondo temperature TK ∼2000 K). This is con-
sistent with a relatively smaller correlation energy U of
2.0 eV21 than those of other strongly correlated electron
systems47. On the other hand, Frenzel et al. pointed out
that the experimental σ(ω) spectra above the wavenum-
ber of 5000 cm−1 (∼0.6 eV) in both a and b axes can be
explained by the DFT calculations well36. All of these
results suggest the weak electron correlation intensity in
MoTe2 and WTe2.
The overall intensity of the experimental σ(ω) spec-
trum of MoTe2 is larger than that of WTe2. This implies4

tent with σ(ω = 0). σ(0) at 10 K is not shown because the

that the DOS of MoTe2 near EF is higher than that of
WTe2. This is consistent with the calculated DOS shown
in Fig. 2b. In addition, the experimental peaks at 100
and 50 meV in MoTe2 can be reproduced in the calcula-
tion. These peaks can be regarded to originate from ﬂat
structures in the bands near the Γ point.

Drude analysis
Figure 4 denotes σ(ω) spectra below the photon en-
ergy of 500 meV and the direct current [σ(0)] at the cor-
responding temperatures. In both of MoTe2 and WTe2,
σ(0) values are located at the extrapolation to the lower
energy side of the σ(ω) spectra at temperatures above
130 K, however, σ(0) values below 40 K become one or
more orders higher than the extrapolation of the σ(ω)
spectra. It should be noted that σ(0) at 10 K (higher
than 106 Ω−1cm−1 in both materials37) is located out of
range. However, in our accessible lowest energy range
above 3 meV, upturn structures in σ(ω) spectra with
decreasing photon energy have been observed. This sug-
gests that the upturns are tails of the Drude curves con-
necting to the σ(0) values, i.e., new conducting carriers

temperatures.
Considering these features, the σ(ω) spectra have been
ﬁtted by using the combination of two Drude functions
as follows;

Here, m denotes the electron rest mass, and σi(0), γi, and
N ∗
i are the direct current value, the damping constant of
carriers, and the eﬀective electron number of each com-
ponent, respectively.
The ﬁtting results are shown in Fig. 5. In the ﬁtting,
the value of σ1(0) + σ2(0) has been assumed to be equal
to σ(0). In MoTe2, at temperatures higher than 130 K,
because the σ(ω) spectra are almost ﬂat, a single broad
Drude function (namely D2) can be applied. Below 80 K,
however, another Drude component (namely D1) with
very narrow peak appears below the photon energy of
10 meV in addition to the D2 component. D1 compo-
nent becomes narrower with decreasing temperature. In5

Drude ﬁtting results in Fig. 5 as a function of tem-

and damping constant (γ), respectively, of D1 and D2 com-
ponents of MoTe2. (c) and (d) are the same as (a) and (b),
respectively, but of WTe2.
WTe2, the temperature dependence is similar to that of
MoTe2, but narrow D1 component appears even at 130–
300 K, which is the same result as shown by Homes et
al.35
Drude ﬁtting results are shown in Fig. 6. In the two
Drude components, ﬁrstly, let us discuss the behavior of
the broad Drude component D2. In MoTe2, N ∗shown in
Fig. 6a slightly decreases but is almost constant with de-
creasing temperature, but in WTe2, shown in Fig. 6c, N ∗
below 20 K becomes about three times smaller than that
above 200 K. The temperature dependence of N ∗origi-
nates from the shape of DOS near EF, i.e., WTe2 has a
large change in DOS near EF in comparison with MoTe2
as seen in Fig. 2b. Therefore, the thermal excitation of
electrons is considered to be the origin of the large tem-
perature dependence of σ(ω) of WTe2. Even though the
calculated temperature dependence of the carrier density
using DOS in Fig. 2b has similar temperature dependence
to the experimental N ∗, however, the calculated carrier
density increases only about 1.5 times with increasing
temperature from 10 to 300 K (not shown here). This
inconsistency suggests that the electron-hole asymmetry
in the DOS should be more accentuated than the calcu-
lation shown in Fig. 2b.
The damping constant γ of D2 in both materials is
almost ﬂat at temperatures below 80 K and slightly in-
creases with increasing temperature above 130 K. Since
the γ value originates from the scattering of carriers and
the boundary temperature T ∗of about 100 K is consis-
tent with the Debye temperature θD = 133.8 ± 0.6 K of
WTe248, the temperature dependence of γ of D2 origi-
nates from the scattering by phonons. Below T ∗, γ be-
comes almost ﬂat, which suggests the existence of con-
stant scattering by impurities and/or defects. This result
is consistent with the behavior of other TMDs, i.e., the
mobility (µ ∝1/γ) that has a tender slope below about
100 K changes to a rapid drop above the temperature49.
Therefore, D2 component is concluded to originate from
the semimetallic bands. It should be noted that N ∗at
10 K evaluated as 1.5 × 1020 cm−3 is consistent with the
sum of the electron and hole carriers obtained from the
size of Fermi surfaces (∼1.35 × 1020 cm−3)11. This also
suggests that D2 originates from semimetallic electron
and hole bands and, in addition, the eﬀective mass of
carriers in the semimetallic bands is almost equal to the
rest mass of electrons.
It should be noted that the carrier densities evalu-
ated from the DOS of MoTe2 and WTe2 in Fig. 2b are
1.3 × 1022 cm−3 and 4.3 × 1021 cm−3, respectively, which
are one order of magnitude larger than the experimen-
tally obtained values. According to the previous quan-
tum oscillation and ARPES data, however, the experi-
mental Fermi surface size is much smaller than the cal-
culated one11,19–22,24.
Therefore, the evaluated carrier
density here is not inconsistent with other experiments.
Next, the narrow Drude component D1 is discussed.
In both materials, N ∗rapidly increases with decreasing
temperature below about 100 K. This change cannot be
expected from the shape of DOS. In addition, as pointed
out by Homes et al.35, one of two semimetallic bands
of the compensated metals is also a candidate.
How-
ever, since the sizes of the Fermi surfaces of electron and
hole bands are the same as each other11 and the disper-
sions of the bands are also similar to each other19, the
Drude parameters of the electron and hole bands should
be similar to each other. Therefore, it is hard to believe
that these two show diﬀerent temperature dependences.
While, γ of D1 rapidly decreases with decreasing tem-
perature below 80 K in contrast to the ﬂat of D2. The
temperature dependence of γ is very similar to that of
type-I Weyl semimetals, TaAs and TaP31. Therefore, D1
is considered to reﬂect the character of Dirac electrons
at Weyl points of MoTe2 and WTe2. From this point of
view, the rapid increase of N ∗with decreasing tempera-
ture suggests that the rapid decrease of the eﬀective mass
m∗because of m∗/m = N0/N ∗, where N0 is the actual
carrier density. This suggests the presence of zero mass
Dirac electrons.
The temperature dependence of the γ of WTe2 follows
γ ∝T 1.6±0.05 below the temperature of 80 K as shown in
Fig. 6b. The extrapolation of the γ to zero temperature
is expected to be zero, in other words, the mobility be-
comes inﬁnity at 0 K. This suggests that the Weyl points
are located just at EF. It should be noted that the re-
lation of γ ∝T 1.6±0.05 is close to the T 2-law of Weyl
semimetals predicted by Hosur et al.50.
On the other
hand, the γ of MoTe2 has the temperature dependence
of γ ∝T 1.5±0.05 at temperatures higher than 40 K, which
is similar to that of WTe2 below 80 K. The temperature
dependence of γ cannot be explained by the Fermi liquid6
theory but is similar to those of non-Fermi liquid materi-
als51,52. The temperature order of γ of MoTe2 decreases
at temperatures lower than 40 K, which has the relation
of γ ∝T 0.8±0.1. This suggests that the Weyl points of
MoTe2 are located a little away (about 40 K ∼3 meV)
from EF because of a residual γ value due to the exis-
tence of massive electrons and/or the electron correlation
intensity increases with approaching EF. An excitonic
correlation might be eﬀected to the origin26. The low-
energy electron correlation near the Weyl points might
eﬀect to the physical properties such as superconductiv-
ity and high thermopower of MoTe2.
The evidence for Dirac/Weyl semimetal phase in opti-
cal sepctra also appears in the power-law dependence of
the interband optical conductivityσ(ω) spectra53,54. The
power-law dependence must appear in the energy region
of Dirac linear bands. In the case of MoTe2 and WTe2, it
must appear below 50 meV with reference to band calcu-
lations. However, since Drude component is dominant in
the energy region, the power-law dependence may not be
visible. In other Weyl semimetals, TaAs and TaP, such
power-law behaviors can be recognized because of weak
Drude components.
IV.
CONCLUSION
To summarize, the electronic structures of type-II Weyl
semimetal candidates MoTe2 and WTe2 have been inves-
tigated by optical conductivity σ(ω) spectra and LDA
band calculations.
Obtained σ(ω) spectra can be ex-
plained by the band calculations with the renormaliza-
tion factor of 0.74 ± 0.01. Two kinds of Drude compo-
nents have been observed below the photon energy of
40 meV. One of the two components originates from the
carriers of semimetallic electron and hole bands, the other
from Dirac carriers at the Weyl points located at EF that
emerge only at low temperatures and the width of the
Drude component become sharper continuously with de-
creasing temperature. Therefore, MoTe2 and WTe2 have
two kinds of carriers and are concluded to be type-II Weyl
semimetals.
