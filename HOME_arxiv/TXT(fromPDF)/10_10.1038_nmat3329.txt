The emergence of complex electronic behaviour from simple ingredients has 
resulted in the discovery of numerous states of matter. Many examples are found in 
systems exhibiting geometric magnetic frustration, which prevents simultaneous 
satisfaction of all magnetic interactions. This frustration gives rise to complex magnetic 
properties such as chiral spin structures1,2,3 orbitally-driven magnetism4, spin-ice behavior5 
exhibiting Dirac strings with magnetic monopoles6, valence bond solids7,8, and spin 
liquids9,10. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of LiZn2Mo3O8, a 
geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet in which the magnetic moments are localized on 
small transition metal clusters rather than individual ions11,12,13. By doing so, first order 
Jahn-Teller instabilities and orbital ordering are prevented, allowing the strongly 
interacting magnetic clusters in LiZn2Mo3O8 to probably give rise to an exotic condensed 
valence-bond ground state reminiscent of the proposed resonating valence bond state14,15. 
Our results also link magnetism on clusters to geometric magnetic frustration in extended2 
 
solids, demonstrating a new approach for unparalleled chemical control and tunability in 
the search for collective, emergent electronic states of matter16,17. 
Numerous materials possess a geometrically frustrated arrangement of magnetic atoms; 
such materials have their magnetic moments arranged on frustrated topologies such as triangular 
lattices18,19, kagomé lattices20,21, hyper-kagomé lattices22, and edge sharing tetrahedra23,24. A rich 
diversity of properties result depending on the magnitude of the per-site spin and orbital 
occupancies. Yet, the presence of local structural distortions25,26, and a degree of site mixing 
between non-magnetic and magnetic layers27 are still key limiters in the quest for new quantum 
states of matter28. Here we show that these problems can be overcome through the use of clusters 
in which a magnetic, unpaired electron is delocalized over a small number of transition metal 
atoms, rather than individual magnetic ions, by demonstrating that the S = ½ cluster magnet 
LiZn2Mo3O8 is geometrically frustrated and likely possesses a condensed valence bond ground 
state. 
LiZn2Mo3O8 is built of discrete Mo3O13 cluster units (figure 1a), in which all Mo atoms 
are on equivalent crystallographic sites29. The average formal oxidation state of Mo is +3.67. 
Each cluster has seven valence electrons. By a simple electron count, supported by molecular 
orbital calculations (figure 1b), six of these electrons localize into Mo-Mo bonds holding the 
cluster together. The seventh electron remains unpaired in a totally symmetric (A1 irreducible 
representation) molecular orbital with equal contributions from all three Mo atoms. The result is 
one S = ½ magnetic moment on each Mo3O13 cluster. This cluster can then replace an atom as the 
basic building block of a geometrically frustrated magnetic system, when appropriately arranged. 
There have been previous reports of systems built of magnetic clusters30. In those cases, the 
unpaired, magnetic electrons within a cluster are still (just like the non-cluster cases) localized on3 
 
individual atoms. By contrast, in LiZn2Mo3O8, the magnetism arises from a collective 
contribution of all three atoms in the Mo3O13 cluster. This gives rise to a S= ½ moment 
delocalized over three Mo atoms. This delocalized nature of the moment contributes to the 
stability of the system and renders the structure impervious to first order Jahn-Teller distortions.   
These Mo3O13 clusters in LiZn2Mo3O8 connect at corners, making a two-dimensional 
Mo3O8 layer (figure 1c). The 2.6 Å Mo-Mo distance within each cluster is substantially shorter 
than between clusters (3.2 Å) reflecting strong metal-metal bonding within each cluster. These 
Mo3O8 layers are separated by non-magnetic Li/Zn ions (figure 1d) to form the full structure 
with R 3m symmetry. Consequently, LiZn2Mo3O8 contains two-dimensional layers in which S = 
½ Mo3O13 clusters are arranged on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice.  
The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of LiZn2Mo3O8 shows 
unusual and unexpected behavior. At temperatures above 96 K, the inverse magnetic 
susceptibility (figure 2a) is well described by the Curie-Weiss law for paramagnetic spins. A 
Weiss temperature of θ = -220 K indicates a net mean-field antiferromagnetic interaction 
between unpaired spins on Mo3O13 clusters. A Curie constant of C = 0.24 emu·K·Oe-1·mol f.u.-1 
(peff = 1.39) is reduced from the ideal 0.375 value for a free S = ½ moment. This may be due to a 
number of possibilities (see SI), but the most likely is a partial unquenched orbital contribution to 
the moment, due to spin-orbit coupling. It is not due to the formation of a metallic state: 
resistivity data (figure S6) shows that LiZn2Mo3O8 is electrically insulating at all accessible 
temperatures. Furthermore, the molecular calculations predict an on-site (cluster) Hubbard U of 
~1.2 eV, which, depending on bandwidth, could open a gap and explain the insulating behavior. 
Together, these data imply that the one unpaired electron per cluster in LiZn2Mo3O8 behaves as a 
localized effective S = ½ magnetic system (with a partial unquenched orbital contribution just4 
 
like Co2+ or Cu2+), and that the magnetic interactions between clusters are strong and 
antiferromagnetic. 
A change in the slope of the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature 
occurs around T = 96 K, with a second linear region of χ(T) present below this transition (or 
crossover). A fit to the linear region from T = 2 K to T = 96 K gives a Weiss temperature of θ = -
14 K and a Curie constant of C = 0.08. This Curie constant is one-third that of the high 
temperature value, indicating that two-thirds of the spins contribute negligibly to the magnetic 
susceptibility below T = 96 K as the Curie constant scales with the number of moments.   
Neutron powder diffraction experiments at T = 12 K indicate that long-range magnetic 
order does not develop below the T ≈ 96 K transition (figure S1). Instead, our results are 
consistent with two-thirds of the effective spins condensing into magnetic singlets. Although our 
data are not sufficient to unambiguously determine whether these singlets are static, making a 
valence-bond solid, or dynamic, making a resonating valence-bond state, neutron powder 
diffraction data suggest that the singlets are indeed dynamic: at T = 12 K, LiZn2Mo3O8 maintains 
the trigonal R3 m symmetry that exists at T = 300 K.  In most cases, static singlets form a 
valence bond network and distort the lattice to a lower symmetry.  Unambiguous determination 
of the ground state warrants further study, but the ground state of LiZn2Mo3O8 is unusual and 
reflective of the strong geometric magnetic frustration.  
Changes in the experimentally measured heat capacity further elucidate the unusual 
electronic behavior in LiZn2Mo3O8 (figure 2b). LiZn2Mo3O8 does not undergo a transition to 
long range magnetic order above T = 0.1 K: there is no sharp lambda transition of the heat 
capacity as a function of temperature. Instead there is only an upturn in the specific heat capacity 
data below T = 1 K. Applied magnetic fields of μoH = 1 T and μoH = 9 T (figure 2b inset)5 
 
radically modulate the behavior of the low temperature data. Such large changes from small 
magnetic fields are surprising given the large Weiss temperature and are likely a result of 
magnetic frustration in the system.  Geometric frustration prevents the formation of long range 
order and results in low-lying magnetic excitations perturbed by an applied field. Simple models, 
such as a multilevel Schottky anomaly, do not adequately describe the low temperature data (see 
SI); further studies are needed to examine and understand the behavior in detail. 
The magnetic entropy change of LiZn2Mo3O8, accounting for the extra lattice 
contribution from lithium compared to Zn2Mo3O8 (figure 2c, figure S2) also indicates the 
condensation of two-thirds of the available spins. The total expected magnetic entropy change 
for S = ½ system is R·ln(2) (= 5.76 J·K-1·mol f.u.-1), compared to the experimental value of 8(3) 
J·K-1·mol f.u.-1 from T = 0.1 to  T = 400 K. On cooling from T = 400 K, we observe a gradual and 
continuous loss of entropy, approximately two-thirds of the expected S= ½ value from T = 400 K 
to T = 100 K. Critically, the change in the linear regions of magnetic susceptibility is not 
accompanied by a sharp transition in the entropy, supporting the claim that these spins condense 
into singlets, rather than adopt long range magnetic order. Furthermore, the difference in entropy 
between T = 0.1 K and T = 100 K is approximately 3
1 R·ln(2), consistent with freezing out of the 
remaining one-third of spins that did not condense into singlets at T = 96 K.  
The resulting magnetic phase diagram of LiZn2Mo3O8 is shown in figure 2d. Near room 
temperature, the system is paramagnetic and the spins thermally randomize. Cooling below the 
condensation temperature (T ~ 96 K), two-thirds of the spins form a condensed valence bond 
state. The remaining one-third spins are still paramagnetic and interacting antiferromagnetically 
until lower temperatures, at which point they lose entropy in a yet-to-be determined manner.6 
 
These results suggest that LiZn2Mo3O8 exhibits geometric magnetic frustration between S 
= ½ magnetic clusters and two-thirds of the spins condense into singlets below approximately T 
= 96 K. Therefore LiZn2Mo3O8 is a candidate for a resonating valence-bond state, as there is no 
evidence for static singlets. More generally, our results show how an extended lattice of 
magnetic clusters, in place of magnetic ions, produces exotic physics while providing numerous 
advantages in the design and control of magnetically frustrated materials. This approach opens a 
new chemical frontier in the search for emergent phenomena in frustrated systems.

Methods 
Phase-pure LiZn2Mo3O8 was synthesized from a mixture of Mo, ZnO, Li2MoO4, and 
MoO2 (99+% purity) with an overall starting formula of LiZn2Mo3O8(Li2Zn2O3)0.2. Mo was used 
as received. ZnO and Li2MoO4 were dried at T = 160 °C overnight. MoO2 was purified by 
heating overnight under flowing 5% H2/95% Ar. The mixtures were pressed into pellets, placed 
in alumina crucibles, and double-sealed in evacuated, fused silica tubes. The reaction vessel was 
heated to T = 600oC for 24 hours, ramped to T = 1000oC at 10°C/hr, held for 12 hours, followed 
by a water quench. The sample was reground and heated again in the same manner. Zn2Mo3O8 
was synthesized in a similar manner, but with 3% excess ZnO, and a final temperature of T = 
1050 oC.  
Magnetization measurements, heat capacities, and resistivities were measured on a 
sintered pellet in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) using a 
dilution refrigerator for T < 2 K measurements.  Heat capacities were measured three times at 
each temperature using the semi-adiabatic pulse technique, waiting for three time constants per 
measurement. Data were collected from T = 0.05 K to T = 400 K under magnetic fields of μoH = 
0 T, μoH = 1 T and μoH = 9 T. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured from T = 1.8 K to T = 
320 K under a μoH = 1 T field. Laboratory X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected 
using Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with a LynxEye detector. 
Powder neutron diffraction data sets at T = 12 K with d-spacing of 0.2760Å ≤ d ≤ 3.0906Å and 
1.6557Å ≤ d ≤ 8.2415Å were collected at the Spallation Neutron Source POWGEN 
diffractometer (BL-11A) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and analyzed with the Rietveld 
method using GSAS with EXPGUI31,32. Molecular orbital calculations using density functional 
theory with the PBE0 functional at the UHF level of theory were performed with the GAMESS 
software package33.8

Figure S1 | 12 K TOF neutron powder diffraction data for LiZn2Mo3O8 from POWGEN. 
a,b. Rietveld refinement of data show that LiZn2Mo3O8 remains in the R3m spacegroup and 
maintains its trigonal symmetry in the condensed valence bond state. The inset in a shows the 
(220) peak at both T = 12 K (open circles) and at T = 300 K (triangles), which are sharp and 
show no indication of a distortion breaking trigonal symmetry. Attempts to fit the patterns to 
lower symmetry but trigonal models (R3m, R32, R3) did not result in better fits to the data. The 
patterns show no extra Bragg reflections or diffuse scattering due to magnetic ordering of any 
kind down to T = 12 K.  
As a test, a magnetic phase was added to the refinement to asses if scattering from a magnetic 
phase would be visible. The magnetic form factor in this material is not known, and there are 
many possible magnetic orders. Thus to estimate our sensitivity to magnetic order, we used a 
120° magnetic state with the Mo metal form factor. This resulted in an upper limit on the 
magnetic moment of 0.2(2) μB per Mo. Together with the absence of an anomaly in the heat 
capacity, these data suggest no magnetic ordering around T = 96 K.17 
 
Heat capacity analysis. 
The magnetic contribution to the heat capacity was extracted by two methods. In the first 
method, the data for non-magnetic Zn2Mo3O8 was scaled to account for the expected change in 
Debye temperature (compared to LiZn2Mo3O8) as well as for the change in the number of atoms 
per formula unit (=14/13). Subtraction gives the estimated magnetic heat capacity shown in 
figure S3(a).

In the second method, the non-magnetic Zn2Mo3O8 data were not scaled for the change in the 
number of atoms per formula unit (paper Figure 2b). Instead, a smooth fit to the non-magnetic 
Zn2Mo3O8 Cp·T-1 was directly subtracted, giving the data in figure S3(b), which includes both the 
magnetic contribution and the extra lattice contribution from the extra lithium atom per formula 
unit.   
 
Figure S3 | Estimated excess heat capacity in LiZn2Mo3O8 computed by two methods. a, In 
the first method, the data for non-magnetic Zn2Mo3O8 was scaled to account for the expected 
change in Debye temperature (compared to LiZn2Mo3O8) as well as for the change in the number 
of atoms per formula unit, leaving only an estimate of the magnetic entropy. Note the unphysical 
dip to negative heat capacity around T = 50 K. b, In the second method, the non-magnetic 
Zn2Mo3O8 data were not scaled for the change in the number of atoms per formula unit, leaving 
contributions from both magnetism and the extra lattice contribution from the extra lithium atom 
per formula unit. The extra lattice entropy of Li can then be accounted for by fitting to an19 
 
Einstein (or Debye) oscillator mode (fit shown in red). 
 
Both methods give similar insights into the magnetic behavior for LiZn2Mo3O8. Method two 
gives a larger feature at T ≥ 100 K, which must (at least partly) the freezing out of the extra 
vibrational modes from Li in LiZn2Mo3O8. Figure S3(b) shows a fit of this feature to an Einstein 
oscillator mode, with an Einstein temperature Θ = 403 K (a Debye mode fits equally well), 
which was subtracted to leave the magnetic contribution. In both cases, the magnetic entropy was 
then extracted by computing

Figure S4 | Estimated magnetic entropy by two methods. a, Integrated Cp·T-1 data from 
method one. Although the dip in entropy around T = 50 K is unphysical, the general result, of 
two distinct regions of entropy loss - below and above T ≈ 100 K – is the same as that found by 
method two. b, Integrated Cp·T-1 from method two. This data is the same as paper figure 2c, and 
also shows two distinct regions of entropy loss.20 
 
 
In both cases, the magnetic entropy contribution contains two discrete regions of entropy 
gain/loss, below and above T = 100 K. We note that the validity of fitting Cp to an Einstein (or 
Debye) oscillator model for the lattice contribution at high temperature (rather than Cv), is 
justified. We estimate that Cv and Cp are the same to within approx. 1% up to T = 400 K: the

 is the isothermal compressibility34. 
LeBail refinements of the neutron diffraction patterns from T=300 K to T=12 K were used to 
estimate β ( ≈ 10-5 K-1 ). The isothermal compressibility was estimated using a literature value 
for another closest packed oxide (MgO 
T
= 7.2 Pa-1; virtually all oxides have isothermal 
compressibilities within one order of magnitude of this value35).  
 
In both methods, there is a low temperature feature in the magnetic Cp·T-1 data. Figure S5 shows 
an analysis indicating that the feature cannot be adequately explained by simple Schottky 
anomaly models. Two or three level Schottky anomalies do not account for excess heat capacity 
in the data, even when other extra terms that might be present are also included.21 
 
 
Figure S5 | Low temperature Cp·T-1 Schottky anomaly analysis. a, μoH = 0 T data fit to a two 
level anomaly and b, μoH = 1 T fit for both a two (red) and three (blue) level Schottky anomaly. 
c, A fit to the μoH = 0 T data allowing for a γT electronic contribution (γ is in units of J·K-2·mol 
f.u.-1) and AT-2 nuclear contribution (A is in units of J·K·mol f.u.-1). Despite allowing for these 
contributions (a γT term is unphysical considering the material is an insulator, see figure S6, 
although such a contribution could arise from spin-liquid behavior) the fit still does not 
adequately describe the data. In all cases, changing the degeneracy of the anomaly levels (go/g1) 
does not resolve the fit, only changes the width by a small amount.  All figures show datasets 
from both methods of subtracting the lattice contribution of Zn2Mo3O8, but at these temperatures, 
the difference is negligible.22

saturated) show that LiZn2Mo3O8 is an electrical insulator and shows no obvious signs of 
electronic transitions. This is as expected for the formation of a condensed valence bond state 
(which occurs as T = 96 K). The high temperature data was fit to a model

Magnetism and spin-orbit coupling considerations. 
In 4d and 5d systems, spin orbit (SOC) contributions to magnetism can be significant. The spin-
orbit coupling constant for Mo is ξ = 0.068 eV, similar to the value for Cu, ξ = 0.100 eV37. 
Furthermore, the crystal field splitting of adjacent states in a Mo3O13 cluster is ~1.2 eV, on the 
same scale as in Cu2+ compounds (~2.4 eV). Thus the effects of SOC are expected to be similar, 
within a factor of 2. To more quantitatively assess the expected effect of spin orbit coupling on 
the observed magnetism, we calculated the expected deviation in the magnetic g-factor arising 
from a partial unquenched orbital contribution (from SOC) in a perturbative manner. To second 
order36, the observed g-value, gm, is given by

 where ge is the ideal value (= 
2.0),  is the spin-orbit coupling constant, and E is the energy gap between electronic states 
from crystal field effects, and A is a constant dependant on the exact nature of the ground and 
low-lying electronic states. The values of  are taken from the literature37 and values for A are 
typically in the range of 2-4. Performing calculations using the extremes of A, we see that gm 
ranges from 1.55 to 1.77, consistent with a g-factor value extracted from the high-temperature 
Curie constant of 0.24 emu·K·Oe-1·mol f.u.-1 found in our data (gm≈1.6). Performing this same 
type of calculation on Cu yields a g-factor range of 2.18 to 2.37, consistent with experiment 
(gm≈2.2). This shows that spin-orbit coupling can be an explanation as to the reduced value of 
the Curie constant (and hence μeff) observed in our inverse susceptibility data.  
 
However, while spin-orbit coupling can itself give rise to interesting magnetic phases38, an 
analysis carried out in the same way as Kotani show that, in this case, it does not explain the 
observed trends in the magnetic data, notably the transition around T = 96 K.24

on equimolar amounts (0.112 mmol) of each compound using the same sample container. This 
allowed for direct subtraction of the two datasets to determine the intrinsic response of the 
unpaired electrons in LiZn2Mo3O8. M(H) curves were linear up to μoH = 1 T, the applied field

to weak antiferromagnetic interactions at  T ≈ 96 K. In a and b, the expected Kotani behaviors 
for d2 ions, d1 ions, and a scaled (by one-third) combination of 2 d2 and 1 d3 ions are shown. The 
d1 case is similar to our proposed spin-½ degree of freedom magnetic molybdenum clusters, and 
the linear combination of d2 and d3 case is what one would expect if each cluster were comprised 
of two Mo4+ and one Mo3+ distinct ions. The observed data are not consistent with any of these26 
 
Kotani behaviors, as can be seen; the shape of the data is inconsistent with a change in 
unquenched orbital contribution with temperature (which is the hallmark of SOC Kotani 
behavior). In c, the extracted Weiss temperatures from fits to the inverse susceptibility data are 
used for the temperature ranges from which they are extracted. In this case the appearance of two 
flat regions above and below this transition indicates a loss of a large contribution to the effective 
magnetic moment around this temperature. This supports the argument that LiZn2Mo3O8 behaves 
as an isolated S=½ system with a partial unquenched orbital contribution that is temperature-
independent (just like Cu2+ compounds).27 
 
 
 
Table S1 | GAMESS input files: 
 
GAMESS input files for calculations on a Mo3O4(OH)3(H2O)6 cluster using unrestricted spin 
density functional theory with the PBE0 hybrid functional and Popel’s N-21 split valence basis 
set with 3 gaussians for Mo, the 6-31G(d) basis for O and the 6-31G basis for H39,40. 
Mo3O4(OH)3(H2O)6 was chosen because it is a neutral molecule, has the same electron count as 
the Mo3O13 clusters in LiZn2Mo3O8, and maintains the C3v symmetry. Input file (a) uses 
Huzinaga’s minimal basis set to provide a suitable initial guess for the electron densities, which 
is then used as input for the full calculation, using input file (b). Changes to the hybrid functional 
or basis sets used in (b) results in only minor changes to the calculated frontier orbitals. Spin-
orbit coupling effects are not included in these calculations.
