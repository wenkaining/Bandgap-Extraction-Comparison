We theoretically study the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) eﬀect in (111)-oriented junctions
Co/MgO/Co(111) and Ni/MgO/Ni(111). The Co-based junction is shown to have a TMR ratio
over 2000%, which is one order higher than that of the Ni-based one.
The high TMR ratio is
attributed to the interfacial resonance eﬀect: The interfacial d–p antibonding states are formed
close to the Fermi level in the majority-spin channel and these states in both interfaces resonate
with each other. This diﬀers essentially from the conventional coherent tunneling mechanism of
high TMR ratios in Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001).

INTRODUCTION
Since the observation of the giant tunnel magnetore-
sistance (TMR) eﬀect in Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001) mag-
netic tunnel junctions (MTJs) [1, 2], the TMR eﬀect has
long been explained by the coherent tunneling mecha-
nism [3, 4]: Bulk wave functions of the ferromagnetic
electrode are selectively ﬁltered by the MgO barrier and
only the ∆1 wave function with half metallicity at the
Fermi level passes through the barrier, leading to the
high TMR ratio [Fig. 1(a)]. However, there is a signif-
icant discrepancy in the TMR ratio between the theory
and experiments; the highest TMR ratio observed so far
is around 500% at low temperature [5], but is about half
of the theoretically predicted value over 1000% [3, 4]. A
possible key to understand this gap is interfacial eﬀects.
Several studies [6, 7] have indicated the importance of in-
terfacial states for explaining temperature dependencies
of TMR ratios [8]. In the (001)-oriented MTJs, the inter-
facial states are formed in the minority-spin state [3, 9]
and tend to decrease the TMR ratio [10].
These motivate us to speculate that interfacial states
provide signiﬁcant contribution to TMR eﬀects in
real experiments and decrease the TMR ratios in
Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001) MTJs.
In contrast, we can
utilize such interfacial states for enhancing the TMR ef-
fect signiﬁcantly; this study proposes a quite high TMR
ratio driven by the interfacial resonance eﬀect in an un-
conventional (111)-oriented MTJ.
In
the
present
work,
we
theoretically
examine
the TMR eﬀect in two basic (111)-oriented MTJs,
Co/MgO/Co(111) [Fig.
1(b)] and Ni/MgO/Ni(111),
where (111) directions of the MgO barrier and ferromag-
netic electrodes (fcc Co or fcc Ni) are parallel to the stack-
ing direction of the MTJ. It is natural to consider such
(111)-oriented MTJs for fcc ferromagnetic electrodes be-
cause the close-packed (111) plane has the lowest surface
energy in the fcc lattice [11]. However, TMR eﬀects in
these MTJs have not been understood well, since most

previous studies have focused on (001)-oriented MTJs
with bcc ferromagnetic electrodes.
We calculate con-
ductances and TMR ratios of the (111)-oriented MTJs
by means of the ﬁrst-principles approach combining the
density-functional theory (DFT) and the Landauer for-
mula. It is shown that the obtained TMR ratio of the
Co-based MTJ is quite high (∼2100%) while that of the
Ni-based one is relatively low (∼250%). From the in-
plane wave-vector dependencies of the conductances, we
ﬁnd that the TMR eﬀect in the (111)-oriented MTJs can-
not be understood from the bulk band structures of the
barrier and electrodes, which is essentially diﬀerent from
the case of the (001)-oriented MTJs. Detailed analyses of
the local electronic structure and the transmittance clar-
ify that the resonance of the interfacial d–p antibonding
states in the majority-spin channel is the origin of the

CALCULATION METHOD
We prepared supercells of Co/MgO/Co(111) and
Ni/MgO/Ni(111) as shown in Fig.
1(b).
The a- and
b-axis lengths were ﬁxed to a = afcc/
√
2 and b =
√
3 afcc/
√
2, where we used afcc = 3.52 ˚A for both the su-
percells. In the Co-based (Ni-based) supercell, we chose
the Co-O (Ni-O) interface, which is energetically favored
compared to the Co-Mg (Ni-Mg) one. The atomic posi-
tions along the c direction in the supercells were relaxed
using the ﬁrst-principles DFT calculation implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) [12].
Here, we adopted the spin-polarized generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) [13] for the exchange-correlation
energy and used the projector augmented wave pseu-
dopotential [14, 15] to treat the eﬀect of core electrons
properly. A cutoﬀenergy of 500 eV was employed and
the Brillouin-zone integration was performed with the
23 × 13 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid. The conver-
gence criteria for energy and force were set to 10−5 eV
and 10−3 eV/˚A, respectively. More details of our struc-
ture optimization are given in our previous work [16].
Using the optimized supercell, we constructed quan-
tum open systems by attaching the left and right semi-
inﬁnite electrodes of Co (Ni) to the Co-based (Ni-based)
supercell. In each quantum open system, we calculated
conductances for both parallel and antiparallel conﬁg-
urations of magnetization in the electrodes using the
PWCOND code [17] in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package
[18]. First, we obtained the self-consistent potential of
the quantum open system, where the GGA and the ul-
trasoft pseudopotentials were used for the DFT calcu-
lation. The cutoﬀenergies for the wave functions and
the charge density were ﬁxed to 45 and 450 Ry, re-
spectively.
The 23×13×1 k points were used for the
Brillouin-zone integration and the convergence criterion
was set to 10−6 Ry. Since our systems are repeated pe-
riodically in the xy-plane, the scattering states can be
classiﬁed by an in-plane wave vector k∥= (kx, ky). For
each k∥and spin index, we solved the scattering equa-
tion derived under the condition that the wave function
and its derivative of the supercell are connected to those
of the electrodes [17, 19].
These calculations and the
Landauer formula give the wave-vector-resolved conduc-
tances GP,↑(k∥), GP,↓(k∥), GAP,↑(k∥), and GAP,↓(k∥),
which are the majority- and minority-spin conductances
in the parallel and antiparallel conﬁgurations of magne-
tizations, respectively. The averaged conductances are
obtained as, e.g., GP,↑= P
k∥GP,↑(k∥)/N, where N is
the sampling number of k∥points. In the present study,
N was set to 2500 ensuring good convergence for the
conductances. Using the averaged conductances, we cal-
culated TMR ratio (%) = 100×(GP −GAP)/GAP, where
GP(AP) = GP(AP),↑+ GP(AP),↓.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table I shows conductances and TMR ratios obtained
in our calculations. In the Co-based MTJ, the parallel
conductance GP is much larger than the antiparallel one
GAP, leading to a quite high TMR ratio of more than
2000%.
On the other hand, the Ni-based MTJ has a
smaller TMR ratio of 250% since the diﬀerence between
GP and GAP is smaller compared to the Co-based case.
One may think that the mechanism of such TMR eﬀects
is similar to that in the (001)-oriented MTJs. Previous
theoretical studies [3, 4] have shown that the TMR ef-
fect in Fe/MgO/Fe(001) is dominated by the bulk band
structures of Fe and MgO along the ∆line corresponding
to the (001) direction; in their results, GP,↑(k∥) mainly
contributing to the high TMR ratio has a sharp peak
at k∥= (0, 0) = Γ. If the similar mechanism holds for
the (111)-oriented MTJs, the TMR eﬀect should be ex-
plained by the band structures along the Λ line corre-
sponding to the (111) direction. In this case, GP,↑(k∥)
or GP,↓(k∥) or both of them should have a large value at
k∥= Γ, since the Λ line is equivalent to the kz line at
k∥= Γ in the present supercells [Fig. 1(b)].
To see whether or not this scenario is valid, we an-
alyzed the in-plane wave vector k∥= (kx, ky) depen-
dencies of the conductances as shown in Fig.
2.
Fig-
ure 2(a) shows the majority-spin conductance GP,↑(k∥)
in the Co-based MTJ playing the key role for the ob-
tained high TMR ratio.
We see that the conductance
at k∥= Γ is much smaller than that around k∥= Γ,
which is clearly diﬀerent from the features expected from
the above-mentioned mechanism. Figures 2(b) and 2(c)
show the minority-spin and antiparallel conductances
[GP,↓(k∥) and GAP,↑(k∥)] in the Co-based MTJ [20],
which also do not have a signiﬁcant value at k∥= Γ
and their values spread more widely in the k∥Brillouin
zone than GP,↑(k∥). In Figs. 2(d)–2(f), we show the k∥
dependencies of the conductances in the Ni-based MTJ.
Although detailed features are diﬀerent from those in the
Co-based MTJ, the conductances also do not have a sig-
niﬁcant value at k∥= Γ. All these results indicate that
the TMR eﬀect in the (111)-oriented MTJs cannot be
explained by the bulk band structures of the barrier and
electrodes along the Λ line, in sharp contrast to the pre-
vious results on the (001)-oriented MTJs [3, 4]. We also3

analyzed bulk band structures of fcc Co, Ni, and MgO
along the Λ line, which revealed that, although the com-
plex band of MgO(111) consists of the Λ1 state, both Co
and Ni do not have a half metallicity in the Λ1 state.
This also suggests the inapplicability of the explanation
based on bulk band structures.
To obtain further insight into the role of the MgO
barrier, we additionally analyzed the TMR eﬀect in
Co/vacuum/Co(111), where the distance between the left
and right interfaces and all the positions of Co atoms were
set to be the same as those of Co/MgO/Co(111). We ob-
tained a TMR ratio of 320%, which is one order lower
than that of Co/MgO/Co(111).
This clearly indicates
the necessity of MgO to achieve a high TMR ratio. From
the comparison of the k∥-resolved conductances between
the vacuum and MgO cases, we found that MgO particu-
larly damps the wave functions that are distributed away
from k∥= Γ.
Interfacial eﬀects are the key to understand the present
TMR eﬀect. As shown in Figs. 2(a)–2(f), the conduc-
tances have signiﬁcant values in a set of k∥points sur-
rounding k∥= Γ. This reminds us of the existence of
the interfacial resonance eﬀect. Examples showing this
eﬀect are Fe/MgO/Fe(001) [3, 21–23], Co/MgO/Co(001)
[24], and FeCo/MgO/FeCo(001) [24], which have inter-
facial states close to the Fermi level in the minority-spin

channel. Such states in the left and right interfaces res-
onate with each other and provide non-negligible values
of GP,↓(k∥) in the k∥points surrounding Γ. Furthermore,
additional transport between the interfacial minority-
spin states and the bulk majority-spin ∆1 state enhance
GAP,↑(k∥) and GAP,↓(k∥). Thus, the interfacial states it-
self tend to decrease the TMR ratio in the (001)-oriented
MTJ. However, since GP,↑(k∥) has a quite large value at
k∥= Γ based on the coherent tunneling mechanism [3, 4],
the interfacial eﬀect provides a small contribution to the
TMR ratio. Note that these are the previous theoretical
results; the interfacial eﬀect is sensitive to the interfacial
conditions in real experiments [21].
To conﬁrm the existence of interfacial states in the
present MTJs, we show in Figs.
3(a) and 3(b) the
projected LDOSs of interfacial Co and O atoms in the
Co/MgO/Co(111) MTJ. In Fig. 3(b), we see that the in-
terfacial O atoms have peaks of the majority-spin LDOSs
in the px and py orbitals close to the Fermi level (EF),
which originates from the antibonding between Co dzx
(dyz) and O px (py) states at the interface.
As men-
tioned below, such interfacial antibonding states mainly
contribute to the high TMR ratio through the inter-
facial resonance eﬀect.
It should be emphasized that
these majority-spin interfacial states enhance GP,↑(k∥)4

but hardly enhance GAP,↑(k∥) and GAP,↓(k∥), which is
because the bulk minority-spin state is not signiﬁcant
in the (111)-oriented MTJ. This is clearly diﬀerent from
the (001)-oriented case and the reason why we obtained
the large TMR ratio in this MTJ. In the case of the
Ni/MgO/Ni(111) MTJ [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)], on the other
hand, the interfacial antibonding state between Ni dzx
(dyz) and O px (py) states is formed at a lower energy
compared to the Co-based case, which is owing to the dif-
ference in the valence electron number between Co and
Ni. Thus, the interfacial O atoms have small majority-
spin LDOSs in the px and py orbitals at E = EF.
Conclusive information on the mechanism for the
present TMR eﬀect is given by the k∥-resolved LDOSs
of interfacial atoms in Co/MgO/Co(111) [Figs.
4(a)–
4(h)] and Ni/MgO/Ni(111) [Figs. 4(i)–4(p)]. Here, we
only showed the LDOSs at E = EF in the Co (Ni) dzx,
Co (Ni) dyz, O px, and O py orbitals providing essen-
tial contributions to the conductances. It is seen that
the LDOS in the Co (Ni) dzx orbital has an almost the
same k∥dependence as that in the O px orbital in each
spin state [e.g., Figs. 4(a) and 4(c)], since these orbitals
make an antibonding state around E = EF as mentioned
above. The same relation holds between the LDOSs of

Of particular importance is that the k∥dependencies of
the conductances in Fig. 2 can be understood by those of
the LDOSs in Fig. 4. In fact, GP,↑(k∥) in the Co-based
MTJ [Fig.
2(a)] can be almost reproduced by mixing
the k∥dependencies of majority-spin LDOSs in the O
px (Co dzx) and O py (Co dyz) states [Figs. 4(a)–4(d)].
The minority-spin conductance GP,↓(k∥) [Fig. 2(b)] also
reﬂects minority-spin LDOSs in the O px (Co dzx) and
O py (Co dyz) states [Figs. 4(e)–4(h)]. In a similar way,
we can explain the k∥dependencies of the conductances
[Figs. 2(d)-2(f)] by those of the LDOSs [Figs. 4(i)–4(p)]
in the case of Ni/MgO/Ni(111); e.g., GP,↓(k∥) [Fig. 2(e)]
has a similar k∥dependence to the minority-spin LDOSs
in the Ni dzx and O px states [Figs.
4(m) and 4(o)].
All these results clearly suggest that the interfacial anti-
bonding states at E ≈EF provide the TMR eﬀect in the
(111)-oriented MTJs through the interfacial resonance ef-
fect.
Further evidence for the interfacial resonance eﬀect
is obtained from the energy dependence of the trans-
mittance.
Figure 5 shows the majority-spin trans-
mittance TP,↑(E) of the Co/MgO/Co(111) MTJ at
(kxa/π, kyb/π) = (0.04, 0.32), where the conductance
GP,↑(k∥) has the maximum value [Fig. 2(a)]. Note that
the transmittance is converted to the conductance sim-
ply by multiplying e2/h [GP,↑(k∥) = (e2/h) × TP,↑(k∥)]
and we showed in Fig. 2 the conductances at E = EF.
In Fig. 5, we can see sharp peaks close to EF, which are
similar to those previously obtained in the minority-spin
transmittance in the Fe/MgO/Fe(001) MTJ exhibiting
the interfacial resonance eﬀect [21–23]. Since the reso-
nance eﬀect usually occurs in a narrow energy range, such
a characteristic energy dependence of the transmittance
is concluded to originate from the interfacial resonance
eﬀect.
On the other hand, when a ﬁnite bias voltage
(∼0.05 V) is applied to the MTJ, the interfacial reso-
nance could be removed owing to its small energy width
[21, 25], leading to the reduction of the TMR ratio. How-
ever, we have many other interfacial states around EF as5
shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Thus, if we increase the
bias voltage further, these interfacial states may form a
new resonance and enhance the TMR ratio [21].
Some previous studies have provided partial informa-
tion on (111)-oriented MTJs.
Hauch et al.
[26] fab-
ricated an Fe(110)/MgO(111)/Fe(110) MTJ with the
(111)-oriented MgO barrier and observed a low TMR
ratio of 54% at low temperature. They attributed the
low TMR ratio to the imperfect spin ﬁltering in the Σ1
state.
Belashchenko et al.
[27] theoretically analyzed
Co/Al2O3/Co(111) MTJs. Although they revealed the
sensitivity of the current spin polarization to the interfa-
cial atomic conﬁguration, the obtained TMR ratios were
quite low (∼60%). In the present work, by focusing on
simpler (111)-oriented MTJs and carrying out detailed
analyses on local electronic structures, we found a quite
high TMR ratio and clariﬁed its underlying mechanism.

SUMMARY
We theoretically investigated the TMR eﬀect in uncon-
ventional (111)-oriented MTJs, Co/MgO/Co(111) and
Ni/MgO/Ni(111). By estimating their transport prop-
erties using the ﬁrst-principles-based approach, we found
that the Co-based MTJ has a TMR ratio over 2000%,
which is much higher than that of the Ni-based one of
250%. The analyses of the LDOSs and the transmittance
showed that the obtained high TMR ratio comes from the
resonance of the interfacial d–p antibonding states in the
majority-spin channel. This mechanism is essentially dif-
ferent from that in the Fe(Co)/MgO/Fe(Co)(001) MTJ
and suggests a novel way to achieve a giant TMR ratio.

[20] In Fig. 2, we only showed GAP,↑(k∥) as the conductance
in the antiparallel magnetization case, because GAP,↓(k∥)
has almost the same k∥dependence as GAP,↑(k∥).
