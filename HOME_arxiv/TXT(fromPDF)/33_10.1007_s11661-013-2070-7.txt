Abstract 
This investigation has used flexural test to explore the effect of thermal treatments i.e. high 
temperature and cryogenic environments on the mechanical property of Al2O3 particulate 
reinforced Cu metal matrix micro- and nano-composites in ex-situ and in-situ conditions. 
Cu-5 vol. % Al2O3 micro (10µm)- and nano (<50 nm)-composites fabricated by powder 
metallurgy route were subjected to up-thermal shock cycle (193 K to 353 K) and down-
thermal shock cycle (353 K to 193 K) for different time periods followed by 3-point bend 
test. One batch of specimens (micro- and nano-composites) was conditioned at 353 K 
temperature and 193 K temperature separately followed by 3-point flexural test. High 
temperature flexural test was performed at 373 K and 523 K temperature on the micro- and 
nano-composites. All the fractured samples obtained after various thermal treatments were 
studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The development of thermal stresses 
quite often results in concentration of residual stresses at the particle/matrix interface 
eventually weakening it. Enhancement of flexural strength was recorded for down- as well3 
 
as for up-thermal shock in microcomposites. The high temperature flexural strength of 
micro- and nano-composites is lower than at ambient temperature. The amelioration and 
declination in mechanical properties as a consequence of thermal shock, thermal 
conditioning and high temperature flexural testing have been discussed in the light of 
fractography.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are excellent candidates for structural components in the 
aerospace and automotive industries due to their high specific modulus, strength, and thermal 
stability. 
[1] Metal matrix composites show a combination of mechanical stiffness 
(reinforcement), a relatively low density and a high damping capacity (matrix). This combination 
makes it an attractive material for aerospace and relatively high temperature applications.4 
 
Strengthening of MMCs depends on the character and architecture of its constituents: the matrix 
and the reinforcement.  
 
Differential thermal expansion is a prime cause of development of thermal stresses in composite 
materials. The thermal stresses generated depend on the reinforcement volume fraction, 
reinforcement geometry, and thermal expansion coefficient mismatch. [2-3] Most reinforcements 
are elastic up to their fracture point, while the matrix undergoes plastic deformation. [4] 
Processing induced reactions and thermal stresses can cause changes in the matrix 
microstructure. These microstructural changes in the matrix in turn can affect the mechanical and 
physical behavior of the composite. The mechanical properties of the composite depend on the 
relaxation mechanism of these thermal stresses. When the thermal stresses accumulated are high 
enough to exceed the elastic limit of the matrix, dislocations are produced in the vicinity of the 
reinforcement. [5-7] 
 
A significant thermal expansion mismatch may result in de-cohesion at the particle/matrix 
interface and/or a possible matrix cracking, particle fragmentation due to thermal stress. [8] Such 
a concentration of thermal stresses around defects (second phase particles) often results in 
catastrophic failure of the composite. [9] Zhou et al. [9] reported that the initial crack occurs in the 
notched-tip region, wherein the initial crack is induced by void nucleation, growth and 
subsequent coalescence in the matrix materials or interface separation.  
 
Improvements of fracture toughness are also ascribed to the mechanisms of crack blunting, 
shielding and crack deflection accompanied by particle pull out. The performance of particle5 
 
reinforced composite is often controlled by the adhesion theories at the particle/matrix mating 
surfaces. Thermal expansion coefficient of metals are substantially greater compared to ceramics 
which leads to either enhancement or degradation of proximal contact between particle and 
matrix occurs under the influence of temperature gradient. [10] The 3-point flexural test results 
may reflect the tendency of the bond strength where the bonding level only is a variable.  A need 
probably exists for an assessment of mechanical performance of such composites under the 
influence of thermal shock. Thermal stresses caused by temperature gradient should be given 
special attention in many application areas. A better understanding of interfacial properties and 
assessment of interfacial strength can help in evaluating the mechanical behavior of particle 
reinforced metal matrix composite materials. It is important to experimentally assess the degree 
of degradative effect of thermal conditioning during exposure to above-zero and sub-zero 
temperatures. Ma et al. [11] studied the cryogenic properties and fracture behavior of Al 
composites predicting the rise in tensile strength at cryogenic temperatures from the room 
temperature. They have also illustrated different fracture modes and features in cryogenic 
temperature range. Poza et al. [12] investigated the fracture mechanisms of Al composites at 
cryogenic and elevated temperatures. The fracture characters at elevated temperatures are 
dominated by interfacial de-cohesion rather than the reinforcement particle fracture. 
 
High thermal conductivity of copper makes it a potent candidate for heat conduction applications 
in aerospace and automobile components. The high conduction coupled with high strength would 
complete the requirements for a high conduction-high strength material. These components often 
suffer high temperature on one surface and cryogenic environment on the other end. [13] The 
copper-alumina combination needs to be understood for the super critical applications in the6 
 
aerospace industry. There is a paucity of literature in this field hence this investigation would 
lead to a comprehensive study of the composite with particle size variation. The advancement of 
science and technology has been rapidly demanding newer material which can endure extreme 
weathering exposures and excursion. This may necessitate the design of experimental process 
and procedures to generate data and findings which would lead to the prediction of reliability of 
mechanical performance of material behavior in unpredictably harsh and hostile environments. 
In this investigation we have subjected the Cu-Al2O3 micro- and nano-composites to different 
thermal treatment modules which consist of thermal shock treatment, thermal conditioning and 
high temperature flexural testing. 
Boccacini et al. [14] have shown that thermal cycling and thermal fatigue in MMCs (in Mg-Al 
alloy system) leads to decrease in elastic modulus and density, these thermal stresses can be 
relieved by plastic deformation of matrix, cracking, debonding at interface followed by void 
formation. The Al alloy–SiC composite show cracks in response to repeated thermal cycling, the 
microhardness decreases with increase in number of thermal cycles. The interfacial cracks lead 
to a decrease in mechanical performance. The matrix-particle interfacial decohesion plays a 
major role in the detoriation of mechanical property than the damage accumulation. [15] Al/SiC p 
composites subjected to thermal cycling and its behavior was studied. Complex dislocation 
interactions take place during thermal cycling. [16] Dislocation debris and curved dislocation 
segments near particle matrix interface indicate relaxation. 
Magnesium alloy reinforced with carbon fibers were fabricated via gas pressure infiltration 
technique and had been subjected to thermal shocks of +100 to -100°C. The number of thermal 
cycles has been varied from 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 to 100 cycles followed by flexural tests. Bending 
modulus, ILSS values and microhardness values were studied after thermal cycling. Variation in7 
 
microhardness symbolizes work hardening, viscolelastic recovery or aging. Thermal cycling led 
to mechanical damage via microcracks, microvoids and fiber protrusion by interfacial sliding.[17] 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
A. Fabrication of composites 
Copper powder (Loba Chemie) (average particle size~11μm, purity- >99.7%) (trace impurities: 
P, Sb, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ag, Sn) was used as the matrix material. Alumina powders (Sigma Aldrich) 
(average particle size~10μm and < 50 nm) were selected as the reinforcement material. The Cu–
5% Al2O3 (10 µm) microcomposites and Cu–5% Al2O3 (< 50 nm) nanocomposites powders were 
blended separately. The specimens having dimensions (31.5 x12.7 x 6.3 mm3) were prepared by 
compacting the powders at a pressure of 500 MPa as per ASTM B 925-08 for 3-point flexural 
test. The compacted specimens were sintered conventionally at 1173 K (900˚C) for 90 minutes in 
argon atmosphere. Three specimens were tested at each point of experimental condition under 
flexural loading. The average of two and/or three closer values of flexural test data was chosen 
for indicating the nature of variation. 
 
B. Ex-situ thermal treatment 
The 3-point flexural test standard specimens were subjected to thermal shock environment with a 
433 K (160˚C) temperature gradient by two separate routes. Thermal shock treatment of the 
micro- and nano-composites was done from 353 K (+80˚C) temperature to 193 K (-80˚C)8 
 
temperature (down-thermal shock) for one batch of specimens and in the reverse order (up- 
thermal shock) for another batch of specimens in three different modules explained in Table. 1. 
After each thermal shock treatment, 3-point flexural test of each sample was performed 
immediately in an universal testing machine (Instron-5967) at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min 
maintaining a span length of 26 mm. Choice of temperatures between +80˚ C and -80˚C was 
made to promote accelerated weathering which readily induces significant scale of damage and 
development in shorter span of time, this accelerated weathering data may be used to predict 
long term durability for application at higher temperatures than -80˚C. The same is true for 
+80˚C. In order to treat the samples for thermal conditioning the samples were categorized into 3 
groups. The first group was treated at 353 K (+80˚C) in muffle furnace for 60 minutes 
isothermally.  The blower of the furnace was on function for heat circulation and uniform heating 
of the samples.  The second set of samples were treated at 193 K (-80˚C) in an ultra low 
temperature chamber for 60 minutes by isothermal holding. The third batch of samples was 
maintained at ambient temperature. 3-point flexural test was conducted immediately at room 
temperature after each thermal conditioning treatment. The loading rate and span length was 
maintained at 0.5 mm/min and 26mm respectively for all the 3-point bend tests. 
C. High temperature flexural testing 
High temperature 3-point flexural test was carried out at a temperature of 373 K (100˚C), 523 K 
(250˚C) on the micro- and nano-composites. The samples were kept inside the furnace chamber 
and the furnace was allowed to reach the required temperature.  The 3-point flexural test was 
conducted just after the temperature attainment.9 
 
 
D. SEM analysis 
 The fracture surface of the all 3-point flexural test samples were observed under scanning 
electron microscopy (JEOL 6480 LV). The fractographic studies revealed the various possible 
fracture modes operating during the thermal shock, thermal conditioning, high temperature 
flexural test and also at ambient temperature.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The densification of Cu-5% Al2O3 microcomposite is 91.04% of theoretical density whereas the 
densification of Cu-5% Al2O3 nanocomposite is 85.2% of theoretical density measured by 
Archimedes method. The microstructures of Cu-5% Al2O3 microcomposites before and after 
down thermal shock treatment have been illustrated in Fig. 1. The fabricated microcomposites 
show good dispersion of alumina particles in copper matrix, whereas the down-thermal shock 
treated microcomposites show particle cracking and particle pull out too. Fig. 2 shows 
micrographs of Cu-5% Al2O3 nanocomposites before and after down-thermal shock treatment. 
The nanocomposite before treatment has been marked with alumina nanoparticles which show 
almost uniform distribution. The microstructure of nanocomposite after down-thermal shock 
shows pulled out agglomerated particle resting on the matrix. Figs. 1 & 2 demonstrate the 
reasonably visible uniform distribution of pores throughout the composite system. The objective 
of this investigation is to assess the variation in mechanical property with the thermal treatments, 
but not so much emphasis on evaluating the absolute values of mechanical properties. The 
absolute value of different properties might differ with the route of fabrication techniques.10 
 
 
A. Thermal shock 
The response to thermal shock on Cu-5 vol% Al2O3 microcomposites and nanocomposites has 
been assessed from the flexural strength on the basis of the 3-point bend test. Fig 3(a) represents 
the ultimate flexural strength of the composite under various thermal shock exposures. The 
specimens were subjected to up-thermal shock (treated at 193 K first then followed by 353 K 
temperature) and down-thermal shock (treated initially at 353 K and then at 193 K temperature) 
for various exposure times, which have been elaborated in Table. 1. 
Microcomposite: Fig. 3(a) shows the effect of thermal conditioning on ultimate flexural strength 
of thermally shocked (up-thermal and down-thermal shock) Cu-Al2O3 micro- and nano-
composites. The trend of increase in flexural strength of microcomposites under subjection of 
thermal shock is time dependent which is quite clear from Fig. 3(a). There is an increment of 
21.95% in flexural strength value for the up-thermal shock treatment in module-1, whereas 
down-thermal shock treatment increases the bending strength value by 29.69%, illustrated in Fig. 
3(b). The fracture surface illustrated in Fig. 4(a) symbolizes the microcomposite tested at 
ambient conditions. The down-thermal shock (i.e. 353 K to 193 K) promoted the intimate 
physical bonding of reinforcement-matrix. The reason could be attributed to the following: at 
353 K the matrix around the alumina particles expands and it imparts a compressive force on the 
alumina particle which could lead to particle fragmentation sometimes (Fig. 4(b)). [18] This also 
leads to better mechanical interlocking of the particle with the matrix. [19] Whereas on the 
contrary when cooling occurs from the processing temperature during fabrication of composite 
the matrix shrinks around the reinforcement particle rendering residual tensile stresses/strains in11 
 
the matrix and compressive stresses/strains in the reinforcement. [20] The increase in flexural 
strength of down-thermally shocked microcomposite is slightly higher than in up-thermal shock 
because the prior conditioning effect predominates over the later shock (which means that the 
thermal shock from (353 K to 193 K) is manifested as prior conditioning at 353 K temperature 
followed by immediate exposure to 193 K temperature i.e. the specimen was conditioned at 353 
K temperature for 1 hour and then immediately exposed to 193 K temperature. Thus the prior 
thermally conditioned specimen has experienced a thermal shock of 433 K temperature). The 
microcomposites when subjected to up-thermal shock, (i.e. 193 K to 353 K) the contraction of 
matrix (copper) takes place to a larger extent than the reinforcement particle (alumina). The 
reason for this could be the higher co-efficient of thermal expansion of copper (16.6 x10-6 k-1) 
than alumina (5.4 x 10-6 k-1), which also aids in the presence of dislocation density at the 
interface. [21] This may lead to physical de-cohesion (Fig. 4(c)) at the particle/matrix conjunction 
which has been observed earlier by Ray et al. [10] in inorganic fiber/polymer composite. The 
dislocations present in the reinforcement proximity also get pinned down when the composite is 
subjected to 193 K. The pinning of dislocations strengthens the composite by resisting the plastic 
flow of the matrix. [22] The interfacial de-cohesion which had possibly occurred at ultra low 
temperature (Fig. 2(c)) could not be restored at 353 K on the same scale. The conditioning at 193 
K for 60 minutes might have created a large interfacial mismatch at the interface which is 
manifested by the presence of differential co-efficient of thermal expansion between copper 
matrix and alumina reinforcement particle. [19]  
Nanocomposite: The ultimate flexural strength value decreases for up-thermal shock whereas the 
strength values increases for down-thermal shock which is confirmed from Fig 5(a) & (b). In up-
thermal shock the matrix in the vicinity of the particle contracts at 193 K temperature possibly12 
 
leading to interfacial de-cohesion. The surface area of the nano particles being higher, the degree 
of de-union anticipated is also high rendering the interfacial bond weak. The above being a 
physical phenomenon cannot be reversed/restored at 353 K temperature, hence the ultimate 
flexural strength decreases. The surface deactivation of alumina nanoparticles which took place 
at 193 K was unlikely to be restored at 353 K. The adverse effect of prior thermal conditioning 
treatment on the composites is not being reversibly reinstated by the subsequent treatment; this 
could 
be 
a 
possible 
reason 
for 
a 
reduced 
value 
of 
flexural 
strength.  
 In down-thermal shock, the degree of physical contact of matrix and the reinforced nanoparticle 
increases at 353 K temperature. (The expansivity of copper matrix is much higher compared to 
that of alumina particle. So, the expansion of matrix onto the particle at +80˚C leads to enhanced 
gripping of alumina by the matrix. This enhanced proximity leads to mechanical strengthening of 
the 
interface 
which 
is 
reflected 
by 
the 
increased 
flexural 
strength 
values.) 
The improved integrity can also be attributed to the enhanced surface diffusivity of nanoparticles 
at high temperature. The physical integrity of copper and alumina has been shown by flexural 
strength. Nanoparticles have high surface energy leading to high surface diffusivity. At high 
temperature it is reasonably expected that the surface diffusivity of nanoparticles gets improved, 
and at sub-zero temperature surface diffusivity gets reduced, as diffusion is a temperature 
dependent 
phenomenon.  
The ultimate flexural strength increases due to the high surface area of nanoparticles and hence 
lead to enhanced interaction of nanoparticles with the matrix at high temperature. Later the 
exposure at 193 K temperature could not induce damage on the same scale as the prior treatment 
at 353 K temperature. The fracture surface of the nanocomposite after down-thermal shock (Fig.13 
 
6(a)) show some tear ridges. Fig. 6(b) & (c) shows the load-displacement curve for micro- and 
nano-composites tested at ambient temperature. 
The Al/AlN composites were prepared by squeeze casting, and were solution treated at 530˚C 
and quenched in water for 2 hours followed by aging for 10 hours at 160˚C. Thermal cycling led 
to increase in tensile strength, elastic limit and yield strength, and over all properties stability of 
the composites which is in accordance with our case, where flexural strength increases with 
thermal shock treatment. [23] Bhattacharya et al. have reported increase in microhardness and 
decrease in density (due to formation of voids) after thermal cycling in Al-SiC composites. [24] 
Cracks at the interface have been observed due to thermal strain in the composite in the clustered 
region of reinforcement. Our investigation also reports particle cracking after thermal shock 
treatment.  
 
B. Thermal conditioning 
Microcomposite: At 353 K temperature, the ultimate flexural strength of microcomposite 
decreases by 29.27% when compared to the untreated sample. The 3-point flexural strength 
values at various conditioning temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 7(a). As the expanding elastic 
matrix imparts a compressive force on the reinforcement particle, this results in particle 
fragmentation (abundantly visible in SEM micrograph Fig. 7(b)) which leads to composite 
softening.  This differential expansion also leads to localized stresses and strain fields in the 
microcomposite. [25] The ultra low temperature conditioning at 193 K may render shrinkage of 
matrix which causes interfacial de-cohesion (Fig.7(c)) decreasing the flexural strength of14 
 
microcomposite by 0.93%. At low temperature the degree of contraction of matrix is higher than 
the reinforcement particle shrinkage. As the probability of particle cracking decreases, this 
results in decrease of the detrimental softening effect. So, the decrease in ultimate flexural 
strength is less pronounced as compared to the 353 K conditioning. 
Nanocomposite: At 353 K temperature, the ultimate flexural strength increases by 15.60 % in 
comparison to the untreated sample (Fig. 8). The nano alumina particles impede the dislocation 
motion leading to the dislocation pileups at the reinforcement particle-matrix boundary, which 
leads to strain hardening of the composite. The enhanced surface diffusivity of nanoparticles at 
high temperature could be another reason for proficient interfacial interaction and subsequent 
composite strengthening. On the contrary the ultra low temperature conditioning of the 
nanocomposite at 193 K decreases the composite strength by 26.31%. As the movement of 
dislocations is a temperature driven phenomena, at low temperature the movement of 
dislocations get arrested which restricts the dislocation pile up consequently decreasing the 
density of dislocation forest. [26] At low temperature the surface diffusivity of alumina 
nanoparticles is quite likely to get lowered in comparison to enhanced diffusivity at high 
temperature, hence the thermal conditioning effect in nanocomposites is pronounced. 
C. High temperature 3-point bend test 
 Microcomposite: At 373 K temperature the copper matrix expands resulting in tensile and 
compressive stress in the matrix and reinforcement respectively enhancing the mechanical 
interlocking between matrix and reinforcement. [27] This leads to the direct strengthening of the 
composite and as a result the ultimate flexural strength of the composite increases by 18.12% 
from the ambient test value (illustrated in Fig. 9(a)).15 
 
 
At 523 K temperature the ultimate flexural strength values decreases by 20.56% from the 
room temperature test value. At higher operating temperatures plasticity of the composite 
increases due to (1) dislocation annihilation (2) activation of dislocation motion by different 
mechanism other than glide (3) relaxation of internal stress at the matrix-particle front, (4) 
enhancement of dislocation recovery at the interface. [28] All the above stated phenomena 
decrease the strain hardening exponent of the composite leading to decrease in ultimate flexural 
strength of the composite. The fracture surface (revealed from Fig. 9(b) & (c)) illustrates ample 
number of particle pull-out of alumina particles possibly due to matrix softening. [12] 
 
Nanocomposite: With increase in operating temperature the strength of the Cu-Al2O3 
nanocomposite decreases by 1.08 % at 373 K and 20.05% at 523 K temperature (Fig. 10(a)).  
With increase in operating temperature the strengthening mechanisms that operate at low 
temperature get relaxed which decrease in the strength of the composite. [27] The fractography 
studies reveal that the fracture mode of the nanocomposite at 373 K is of ductile type (Fig. 10(b)) 
whereas the failure characteristic features of the composite at 523 K temperature can be 
characterized by dimple markings (matrix softening at elevated temperature). The 
nanocomposites do not show pronounced dimples in ambient conditions of testing, whereas at 
high temperature of testing presence of dimples suggest matrix softening to a certain extent. 
Uematsu et al. subjected Al-SiC composites to high temperature testing, showing decrease in 
tensile strength with increase in testing temperature such as 150˚C and 250˚C. [29] The fracture 
surface indicated particle fracture and particle/matrix crack intiation due to softening of matrix at 
high temperature which is in agreement with our results.16 
 
D. Comparison of behavior of differently treated composites 
The present investigation has largely emphasized the study of damage and/or development of 
flexural properties under the condition of up-thermal and down-thermal shocks. The experiment 
has further focused on the variation of flexural behavior by the imposition of thermal 
conditioning and high temperature exposure on micro- and nano-particle embedded Cu based 
composites. 
Thermal shock 
 The composites are exposed to temperature gradient of 433 K (from 353 K to 193 K i.e. down- 
thermal shock, and 193 K to 353 K temperature i.e. up-thermal shock). This thermal shock 
experiment revealed that the flexural strength of microcomposites increases after down- as well 
up-thermal shock treatments. Whereas, for nanocomposites there is an incremental improvement 
in flexural strength after down-thermal shock conditioning and the decrease of its value has been 
observed after up-thermal shock treatment.  
The larger surface/volume ratio of alumina nanoparticles in comparison to microparticles implies 
more surface area contact with the copper matrix for the former. The implications of thermal 
treatments for both the up-and down-thermal shocks are likely to affect more particle/matrix 
interfaces in nanoparticles embedded copper matrix system. Thus it may reasonably be proposed 
that the differential co-efficient thermal expansion of copper and alumina may manifest larger 
amount of interfacial damage in nanosystem, because of an exposure to a temperature gradient in 
a short span of time. That is why more degradation has been observed in nanocomposites.17 
 
The enhancement of property has also been observed in few cases for both the systems. This may 
be manifested by an improvement in mechanical interlocking factor. This improvement in 
interlocking factor may sometimes get nullified and/or diminished during exposure in an 
opposite direction of thermal cycling. These contradictory and inconclusive natures of behaviour 
might be attributed to the generation of opposite and complex residual stresses during exposure 
to high to low and low to high temperature cycles.  
Thermal conditioning  
The specimens had experienced a temperature of 353 K and 193 K separately which were 
conditioned at that temperature for an hour. The microcomposites reflect a decrease in flexural 
strength after 353 K temperature conditioning. Nanocomposites show an increase in flexural 
value at 353 K temperature, and decrease at 193 K temperature conditioning respectively. 
The reduction in mechanical property during cryogenic conditioning may be attributed by the de-
cohesion between alumina particle and copper matrix in nanocomposites. This might have been 
manifested because of large difference in co-efficient of thermal contraction between particle and 
matrix. 
The high temperature exposure of nanocomposites has demonstrated an increase in mechanical 
property. It may be reasonably assumed that differential expansion may be leading to better 
particle matrix registry and thereby closer proximity is ensured. 
The lower surface area/volume ratio of microparticle in comparison to the nanoparticle 
embedded copper matrix has shown no significant changes for cryogenic temperature 
conditioning and a decline in flexural strength at high temperature conditioning. The forced close18 
 
intimacy of the alumina microparticle and matrix at high temperature leads to development of 
residual stresses at the particle/matrix interfacial region. This non-uniform distribution of 
residual stresses may decrease the threshold value of crack nucleation and propagation along the 
particle/matrix interface region. The differential co-efficient of thermal expansion between 
alumina particle and copper matrix has lesser impact and implications either in advancement or 
declination of mechanical property in micro-alumina reinforced copper composites. 
 
High temperature flexural test 
The composites were tested at 373K and 523 K temperatures, and these temperatures were 
maintained constant throughout the experiment. The increase in flexural strength at 373 K and 
decrease in flexural strength at 523 K temperatures reflect the poor high temperature 
sustainability of microcomposites. The nancomposites also reveal low flexural strength at 523 K. 
The increase in flexural strength at 373K is due to the effective gripping of alumina particle and 
copper matrix due to relatively higher expansion of copper than alumina. The residual stress 
development triggers the forced close registry between particle and matrix imposed by high 
temperature (523K) conditioning.  This may not be conducive for the generated residual stresses 
to be distributed properly and uniformly. These accumulated non-uniform residual stresses may 
decrease the threshold value of crack nucleation and propagation along the particle/matrix 
interface region.19 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
Copper with 5 vol. % alumina micro- and nano-composites were fabricated by conventional 
powder metallurgy route.   Both up- and down-thermal shock treatments enhance the ultimate 
flexural strength of Cu-Al2O3 microcomposites.  The variation of flexural strength is 
contradictory and far from comprehensive conclusion in Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites. Thermal 
conditioning at 353 K temperature improves the ultimate flexural strength of Cu-Al2O3 
nanocomposites. At high operating temperatures (i.e. 523 K) the ultimate flexural strength of 
both Cu-Al2O3 micro- and nano-composites decreases. SEM micrographs reveal ductile mode of 
fracture for both micro- and nano-composites. Ductile fracture characteristics have been 
observed predominantly for Cu-Al2O3 microcomposites. Fracture characters visible in Cu-Al2O3 
nanocomposites indicate ductile mode of failure. The nanoparticles in nanocomposites have 
higher surface area as compared to microparticles in microcomposites. So, the thermal shock 
induced stress in nanocomposites is more visible in terms of degradation and enhancement of 
flexural strength. The development and detoriation of physical integrity of composite is 
predominant in nanocomposites than microcomposites. Noticeable differences in the flexural 
strength and response to thermal exposures of the micro- and nano-composites have been 
observed, and have been explained in terms of difference in their fracture surface 
microstructures.
