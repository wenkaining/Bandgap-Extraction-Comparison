1We have studied the anomalous Nernst eﬀect (ANE) in [Fe3O4/Pt]-based het-
erostructures, by measuring the ANE-induced electric ﬁeld with a magnetic ﬁeld
applied normal to the sample surface, in the perpendicular magnetized conﬁguration,
where only the ANE is expected.
An ANE voltage is observed for [Fe3O4/Pt]n
multilayers, and we further investigated its origin by performing measurements in
[Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayers as a function of the Pt thickness. Our results suggest the
presence of an interface-induced ANE. Despite of this ANE, the spin Seebeck eﬀect
is the dominant mechanism for the transverse thermoelectric voltage in the in-plane
magnetized conﬁguration, accounting for about 70 % of the measured voltage in the
multilayers.

2Thermoelectricity deals with the study of heat-to-electricity interconversion processes,
having the potential for the development of waste heat energy-harvesting technologies.
Since the discovery of the spin Seebeck eﬀect (SSE)1,2 a new heat-to-electricity conver-
sion paradigm in magnetic systems was established and has been extensively studied in a
wide range of materials.3,4 This invigorated the ﬁeld of spin caloritronics,5,6 which studies
the interaction between heat, electron and spin currents. In the SSE, a spin current7 is gen-
erally created in a ferromagnetic material (F) upon application of a temperature gradient,
and electrically detected in an adjacent normal metal (N) by the inverse spin Hall eﬀect
(ISHE).8
The presence of the SSE in magnetic insulators,2 has potential advantages over conventional
thermoelectrics due to lower heat dissipation losses. Its experimental geometry, with the
thermal and electric current paths perpendicular to each other, is also advantageous for the
implementation of thin ﬁlm and ﬂexible thermoelectric devices.9,10 However, the low mag-
nitude of the measured voltage is an obstacle for the development of potential SSE applica-
tions. In this regard, diﬀerent possibilities are currently being explored,4 such as increasing
the spin current detection eﬃciency,11,12 spin Hall thermopiles,13,14 [F/N]n multilayers14–21
or bulk composite systems.22
The ISHE-induced electric ﬁeld, driven by the thermally generated spin currents in the SSE,
can be written as:
EISHE = θSHρ(JS × σ),
(1)
where θSH and ρ denote the spin Hall angle and electric resistivity of N, respectively. EISHE,
JS, and σ are the ISHE generated electric ﬁeld, spatial direction of spin current (perpendic-
ular to the F/N interface) and spin-polarization vector (parallel to the magnetization, M).
The geometry for the detection of the ISHE is similar to that of the ANE in electrically
conductive ferromagnets, which is phenomenologically described by the expression:
EANE = QSµ0(∇T × M),
(2)
where QS, µ0, ∇T, and EANE are ANE coeﬃcient, the vacuum permeability, applied thermal
gradient and ANE-induced electric ﬁeld, respectively. Therefore, when using ferromagnetic
metals, care must be taken in order to separate the contribution of the SSE from that of
the ANE.23 In the case of Fe3O4/Pt the ANE contribution from Fe3O4 is expected to be
negligibly small due to the resistivity of Fe3O4 being two orders of magnitude larger than
3that of Pt.24
Another source of ANE-driven electric ﬁeld can be due to a possible magnetic proximity
eﬀect (MPE) at the Fe3O4/Pt interface. In the case of YIG/Pt and other insulating fer-
rimagnetic oxides the MPE has been shown to be negligibly small.25–28 However, recent
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements in a Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4 trilayer,29
show a large induced magnetic moment in the Pt interlayer, therefore investigating its eﬀect
on the thermally-driven magnetotransport properties30 is important to gain further insight
of the heat-to-electricity conversion process in [Fe3O4/Pt]-based heterostructures. To this
purpose, we have performed measurements of the longitudinal SSE,31 with an in-plane mag-
netic ﬁeld (IM) [Fig. 1(a)], and the ANE with a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular to
the sample surface (PM) [Fig. 1(c)]. The measurements in the PM conﬁguration allow to
unambiguously determine the ANE due to the fact that, in this conﬁguration, any injected
spin current is parallel to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld H (JS ∥H ∥z) and EISHE = 0
due to the ISHE geometry (Eq. 1).3,32
Here, we have studied two type of Fe3O4/Pt-based heterostructures: [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers
(these are the same samples used in our previous studies),14–16,20,21 and [Fe3O4/Pt(tPt)/Fe3O4]
trilayers with nominal Pt thicknesses ranging from 1 to 40 nm. The Fe3O4 ﬁlms were grown
on MgO(001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (UHV).
The Pt ﬁlms were sequentially deposited by DC magnetron sputtering in the same UHV
chamber. The substrate temperature during the entire thin ﬁlm growth process was kept at
480 ◦C. The structural quality of the samples was conﬁrmed by x-ray diﬀraction and high
angle annular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), de-
tailed information about sample preparation and characterization can be found elsewhere.15
For the thermoelectric measurements we apply a constant heat power, inducing a thermal
gradient (∇T) in the z direction. A magnetic ﬁeld (H) with magnitude H is swept in the
x direction while the SSE voltage in the Pt ﬁlm is measured along the y direction (V ) [Fig.
1(a)].3,4,31 For the PM measurements, ∇T and H are applied parallel to the sample x and
z directions, respectively [Fig. 1(c)]. The sample dimensions are Lx = 2 mm, Ly = 7 mm
and Lz = 0.5 mm.
Figures 1(b) and (d) show the results of the transverse thermoelectric voltage for the
[Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers in the IM and PM conﬁgurations, respectively. The voltage mea-
sured in the IM conﬁguration is more than one order of magnitude larger than that observed
4in the PM conﬁguration. However, to quantitatively compare these voltages, we need to
know the temperature gradient distribution in the sample. In the PM conﬁguration both
multilayer and substrate are subjected to the same thermal gradient, since they are in
direct contact to the AlN plates. However, in the IM conﬁguration we need to evaluate
the thermal gradient distribution across the thickness direction (∥z). By considering heat
conservation across the direction of applied heat current: κMgO∇TMgO = κML∇TML, and us-
ing the previously reported values for the thermal conductivities of MgO33 and [Fe3O4/Pt]n
multilayers,15 we obtain ∇TML = κMgO
κML ∇TMgO ∼20∇TMgO for our samples.34 (Suppl. Mat.).
Then, we can estimate that the ANE in the [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers accounts for about 30
% of the measured voltage in the IM conﬁguration, indicating that there is a non-negligible
contribution from the spin-polarized conduction electrons to the transverse thermoelectric
voltage, although signiﬁcantly smaller than the SSE voltage.
In order to gain further insight into the nature of the ANE contribution, we systematically
measured the transverse thermoelectric voltage in [Fe3O4/Pt(tPt)/Fe3O4] trilayers with dif-
ferent platinum thicknesses, tPt. Figures 2(a) and (b) show the voltages measured in the
IM and PM conﬁgurations, respectively. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a) the voltage in
the IM conﬁguration continuously increases as the Pt thickness decreases with a maximum
at 3 nm and then rapidly decreasing, in agreement with previously reported Pt thickness
dependence of the ISHE voltage in a YIG/Pt system.35 In contrast, the ANE-induced ther-
moelectric voltage in the PM conﬁguration shows a monotonic increase of magnitude as the
Pt thickness decreases [inset of Fig. 2(b)].
The observed ANE can originate from: the ANE of Fe3O4,36 or the presence of a magnetic
interlayer at the Fe3O4/Pt interface. Under the ﬁrst scenario the observed ANE voltage is
expected to be strongly suppressed below the metal-insulator transition [Verwey transition,
TV ∼110 K for these ﬁlms, see inset of Fig. 2(c)]. This is due to the even larger resistivity of
Fe3O4 and increased shunting eﬀect by the Pt layer. However, the temperature dependence
of the thermoelectric voltage in the PM conﬁguration [Fig. 2(c)] shows a non-negligible
voltage even at temperatures lower than TV , suggesting that the ANE signal might be
originated at the Fe3O4/Pt interface.
Let us now focus on the thickness dependence of the ANE voltage measured in the PM
conﬁguration at room temperature. To analyze the result, we consider an equivalent circuit
model in which a magnetic interlayer of thickness tMP is included at the Fe3O4/Pt interfaces
5[Fig. 3(a)]. This model describes the two previous scenarios where the ANE can originate
from the Fe3O4 ﬁlm (EF) and at the interface region (EMP). The resultant electric ﬁeld in
the non-magnetic Pt layer (Ey) can be expressed as:
Ey =
1
1 +
ρFρMP(tPt−2tMP)
2ρPt(tFρMP+tMPρF)
tFρMPEF + tMPρFEMP
tFρMP + tMPρF

,
(3)
where ρF (ρMP, ρPt) and tF (tMP, tPt) represent the resistivity and thickness of Fe3O4 (MPE,
Pt) layer, respectively. We consider ρF = 6.96 × 10−5 Ωm,15 and ρMP = ρPt (since they
represent the magnetic and non-magnetic parts of the Pt layer). The thickness dependence
of the Pt resistivity in the trilayers [Fig. 3(b)], is well described by conventional electron
transport in metals:37,38 ρPt = ρ∞

1 +

8(tPt−h)(l∞(1 −p))

, obtaining the ﬁtting parame-
ters: ρ∞= 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−7 Ωm, h = 1.6 ± 0.7 nm and l∞= 18 ± 9 nm, where p = 0
is assumed.39 These are used in Eq. 3 to include the thickness dependence of ρPt into our
model.
In Eq. 3 all the parameters are known, except for EMP and tMP. We can estimate the value
of EMP using the model proposed by Guo et al.40, where they theroretically estimated the
ANE in a magnetized Pt as a function of the induced spin magnetic moment (mS). With
their estimation and the value of mS = 0.31 ± 0.04 µB for Pt recently measured by XMCD
in a Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4 trilayer by Kikkawa et al.29, we obtain the induced ANE electric ﬁeld
as a function of the Pt resistivity (EMP/∇T = 2.5 ρPt, where the resistivity prefactor units
are Am−1K−1).
Now we can analyze the thickness dependence of the ANE using Eq. 3. First, we evaluate
the eﬀect of the ANE of only the Fe3O4 layers, described by considering tMP = 0 nm as
shown in Fig. 3(d), the magnitude of the Ey thus obtained cannot explain our results, with
a lower magnitude of the ANE. If we now introduce a non-negligible tMP we can reproduce
the results with a value of the magnetic Pt thickness of about tMP = 0.1 nm. This thick-
ness is signiﬁcantly smaller than that obtained from XMCD and X-ray resonant magnetic
reﬂectivity (XRMR) studies of Fe/Pt layers.26,41,42 It is also smaller than the thickness of
a possible interdiﬀusion region at the Fe3O4/Pt interface, as suggested by STEM elemen-
tal mapping measured by electron energy loss (EELS) and electron dispersive x-ray (EDX)
spectroscopies in a [Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayer with tPt = 10 nm [Fig. 3(c)], which suggest
a small interface region of about 0.5 nm, where the Fe and Pt signals overlap. Even after
considering a possible magnetic interdiﬀussion layer into our model, a non-negligible tMP is
6needed to explain the results (Suppl. Mat.34). One possible scenario is that a subnanometer
interdiﬀussion of Fe due to heating induces a modiﬁcation of the Fe coordination and in-
creases the Fe concentration at the interface.43,44 This can result in an extrinsically induced
Pt magnetic moment around Fe due to a modiﬁcation of the nature of the F/N interface.
This scenario is in agreement with a recent report,45 and further supported by ANE mea-
suremens of a Fe3O4/Pt bilayer, with Pt ﬁlms deposited at two diﬀerent temperatures (room
temperature and 480 ◦C, Suppl. Mat.34), which show an increase of the ANE for Pt grown
at higher temperature.
Finally, we would like to expand our model to describe the dependence of the interface-
induced ANE on the number of multilayers. For a [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayer, the expression of
the ANE-induced electric ﬁeld is:
Ey =
1
1 +
ρMPρF[ntPt−(2n−1)tMP]
ρPt[ntFρMP+(2n−1)tMPρF]
ntFρMPEF + (2n −1)tMPρFEMP
ntFρMP + (2n −1)tMPρF

.
(4)
Using the values of EMP and tMP previously estimated, we can obtain the dependence of the
interface-induced ANE as a function of the number of layers n. Fig. 4 shows the comparison
between the ANE measured in the PM conﬁguration for two sets of multilayers with tPt = 7
and 17 nm and the estimation using Eq. 4. Our model can describe the dependence of the
ANE-induced electric ﬁeld with the number of bilayers (n) and the layer thicknesses, the
magnitude of the predicted ANE in the multilayers is slightly smaller than the measured
one, specially in the case of thinner samples. The observed magnitude diﬀerence could be
possibly due to the presence of additional contributions, such as interface-roughness-induced
spin-orbit eﬀects in the ferromagnetic layer,46 which can generate ANE-like voltages as sug-
gested in Ref. 18.
In summary, we observed a non-negligible ANE in [Fe3O4/Pt]n multilayers and investigated
its origin by systematic measurements in [Fe3O4/Pt/Fe3O4] trilayers as a function of the
Pt thickness. The results can be understood by an interface-induced ANE, with its origin
possibly due to a subnanometer Fe-Pt interdiﬀusion, which possibly aﬀects the Fe coordina-
tion and/or the elemental composition at the interface. Measurements of magnetic moment
and length-scale of magnetic interface (tMP) as a function of Pt deposition temperature
by other techniques (XMCD, XRMR) can help to further clarify the origin of the observed
eﬀect. These results suggest the possibility of tuning the thermoelectric response by thermal
7treatment and that, although the SSE is the dominant mechanism, the interface-induced
ANE can positively contribute to the the spin-induced thermopower in multilayer systems.

FIG. 2. (Color online) (a,b) Magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the transverse thermoelectric voltage
measured in the (a) IM and (b) PM conﬁgurations for [Fe3O4(50)/Pt(tPt)/Fe3O4(50)] trilayers
with diﬀerent nominal Pt thicknesses. Inset of (a), (b) show the magnitude of the intercept at
zero ﬁeld of the measured voltage [V0/(Ly∇T(z,x))], determined by linear extrapolation of the high
ﬁeld data as schematically depicted by the dashed line of (a). (c) Temperature dependence of the
magnitude of the transverse thermoelectric voltage in the PM conﬁguration at H = 10 kOe for tPt
between 1 and 10 nm, obtained from the measured magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the voltage at each
temperature. Inset shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a Fe3O4/Pt(1)/Fe3O4
trilayer, showing that for this tPt value the Fe3O4 layer dominates the transport properties.
