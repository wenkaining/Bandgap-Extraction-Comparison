Using complementary polarized and unpolarized single-crystal neutron diffraction, we have investigated the
temperature-dependent magnetic structures of Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2. Upon 50 % dilution of the Eu sites with
isovalent Ca2+, the Eu sublattice is found to be still long-range ordered below TEu = 10 K, in the A-typed
antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure. The moment size of Eu2+ spins is estimated to be as large as 6.74(4) µB
at 2.5 K. The Fe sublattice undergoes a spin-density-wave transition at TSDW = 192(2) K and displays an in-
plane AFM structure above TEu. However, at 2.5 K, the Fe2+ moments are found to be ordered in a canted
AFM structure with a canting angle of 14(4)° out of the ab plane. The spin reorientation of Fe below the AFM
ordering temperature of Eu provides a direct evidence of a strong interplay between the two magnetic sublattices
in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with the critical
temperature Tc = 26 K in ﬂuorine-doped LaFeAsO in 2008
has opened up an “iron age of superconductivity”.1 Shortly
after that, Tc above 50K was achieved in RFeAsO1−xFx
(“1111” system, R = Ce, Sm, Pr, Nd, and Gd) with R be-
ing a rare-earth element.2–5 SC with Tc up to 38 K was also
realized by various chemical substitutions in the ternary “122”
compounds AFe2As2 with A being an alkaline-earth-metal el-
ement (Ca, Ba, Sr) or the rare-earth element Eu.6–8 It was well
conﬁrmed that the SC in the iron pnictides emerges upon the
suppression of the static long-range spin-density-wave (SDW)
order of Fe by means of chemical doping or applying exter-
nal pressure.9,10 Although SC is compatible with the local-
ized moments of the rare-earth ions in either “1111” or “122”
system,11–14 how the magnetism of Fe and rare-earth element
interact with each other is still not well elucidated.
In-depth experimental studies performed on quaterary
“1111” RFeAsO system have provided compelling evidences
that there is a strong coupling of Fe and R magnetism for R
= Ce, Sm, Pr, and Nd, respectively.15–19 However, for ternary
EuFe2As2 compounds, it is quite controversial regarding the
strength of the interplay of Fe and Eu magnetism.20–27 As a
special member of the “122” system, EuFe2As2 has drawn
tremendous attention, due to the strong spin-charge-lattice
coupling and doping- or pressure-induced coexistence of SC
and strong ferromagnetism.28–35 In a purely ionic picture, the
S-state (orbital moment L = 0) Eu2+ rare-earth ion has a 4f 7
electronic conﬁguration and a total electron spin S = 7/2, cor-
responding to a theoretical total effective magnetic moment
of µeff = g
p
S(S + 1) = 7.94 µB (with the Landé factor g
= 2).36 The non-superconducting parent compound EuFe2As2
undergoes a structural phase transition from a tetragonal to an
orthorhombic phase at 190 K, concomitant with a SDW or-
dering of the itinerant Fe moments. In addition, the localized
Eu2+ spins order below 19 K in the A-type antiferromagnetic
(AFM) structure (ferromagnetic layers stacked antiferromag-
netically along the c axis).37
According to previous neutron and non-resonant x-ray
magnetic scattering experiments,20,21 the coupling between
the Eu and Fe sublattices in EuFe2As2 was found to be negli-
gible, which was further supported by density-functional elec-
tronic structure calculations.22 Also, a direct optical pump-
probe showed a slow response of the Eu2+ spins to the optical
excitation of the itinerant carriers on the FeAs layers, suggest-
ing a weak coupling between the two sublattices.23 In contrast,
magnetic Compton scattering on EuFe2(As0.73P0.27)2 indi-
cated that the magnetism of Fe gets enhanced when the Eu
magnetic order sets in.24 In addition, nuclear magnetic res-
onance (NMR) and Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements
revealed a strong coupling between the localized Eu2+ mo-
ments and the conduction d electrons on the FeAs layers
in Co-doped EuFe2As2.25,26 Recently, by performing x-ray
resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) measurement on un-
derdoped Eu(Fe0.94Ir0.06)2As2, we have observed the mag-
netic polarization of the Ir 5d band induced by the AFM or-
dering of Eu, indicating a strong interplay between the two
sublattices.27 Undoubtedly, detailed knowledge about the evo-
lution of magnetic structures of both Eu and Fe with the tem-
perature will be crucial for understanding these observations.
Isovalent substitution of Eu with Ca offers an ideal platform
for studying the delicate interplay between the two magnetic
sublattices. On the one hand, under ambient pressure, Ca dop-
ing into the Eu site does not perturb the SDW order in the
FeAs layers visibly and never leads to SC. On the other hand,
dilution of the Eu sublattice with nonmagnetic Ca2+ ions sup-
presses its AFM ordering temperature (TEu) gradually.38–40 A

recent µSR study on Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 suggests a long-range
magnetically ordered Eu sublattice.39 However, it was pro-
posed based on macroscopic measurements that substitution
of 50 % Eu ions might lead to a short-range ordered nature of
Eu magnetism.43 In order to determine the ground-state mag-
netic structure of Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 and check the interplay
between two sublattices, we have performed the temperature-
dependent polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction stud-
ies on the Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 single crystal. The Eu2+ mo-
ments are found to be long-range ordered below TEu = 10
K, in the A-typed AFM structure. A spin-reorientation of the
Fe2+ moments is clearly observed around TEu, providing a
direct evidence of a strong coupling between the Fe and Eu
magnetism.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Single crystals of Eu1−xCaxFe2As2 (x = 0.5 nominally)
were grown using the Sn ﬂux method.39 No incorporation of
Sn into the crystals was evidenced according to the energy-
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterization. The
concentration of Ca was determined to be 52(4) % by nuclear
structure reﬁnement of the neutron diffraction data, as pre-
sented below. A 88 mg platelike single crystal with dimen-
sions ∼4 × 3 × 0.6 mm3 was selected for unpolarized and
polarized neutron diffraction measurements, which were per-
formed on the hot-neutron four-circle diffractometer HEiDi
and and diffuse scattering cold-neutron spectrometer DNS, re-
spectively, at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ), Garch-
ing (Germany).41,42 For measurements at both beamlines, the
single-crystal sample was mounted on a thin aluminum plate
with tiny amount of GE varnish and put inside a standard
closed-cycle cryostat. At HEiDi, a Ge (3 1 1) monochromator
was chosen to produce a monochromatic neutron beam with
the wavelength of 1.17 Å, and an Er ﬁlter was used to mini-
mize the λ/2 contamination. At DNS, the wavelength of the
incident neutrons is 4.2 Å. The [0, 1, 0] direction of the crystal
was aligned perpendicular to the horizontal scattering plane,
so that the (H , 0, L) reciprocal plane can be mapped out by
rotating the sample. Throughout this paper, the orthorhom-
bic notation (space group Fmmm) will be used for conve-
nience. Single crystals from the same batches were character-
ized by macroscopic measurements including the resistivity,
heat capacity, and dc magnetic susceptibility, using a Quan-
tum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS)
and Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system
(MPMS).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Macroscopic properties of Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 single crystal
was shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Materials.
Two magnetic transitions corresponding to the SDW ordering
of the Fe sublattice and AFM ordering of the Eu2+ moments
are identiﬁed around 190 K and 10 K, respectively.

for Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 obtained at T = 3.5 K via polarized neutron
diffraction at DNS, with the neutron polarization parallel to the scat-
tering vector Q (x polarization). Intensities in the SF (a) and NSF
(b) channels correspond to the magnetic and nuclear reﬂections, re-
spectively. The appearances of (0, 0, 2) and (0, 0, 4) reﬂections in the
XSF channel are due to the imperfection of the polarization analysis
and leakage from the XNSF channel.
Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2,
polarized neutron diffraction at 3.5
K was ﬁrstly performed at DNS. Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) show
the reciprocal-space contour maps of the (H , 0, L) plane,
measured with the neutron polarization parallel to the scat-
tering vector Q (x polarization). The magnetic and nuclear
scattering were separated into the spin-ﬂip (SF, Fig. 1(a)) and
non-spin-ﬂip (NSF, Fig. 1(b)) channels, respectively.46 The
appearance of (0, 0, 1), (0 ,0 ,3) and (-2, 0, 1) reﬂections in
the XSF channel clearly indicates that the Eu2+ moments
are antiferromagnetically ordered at 3.5 K, with a propaga-
tion vector of k = (0, 0, 1), similar to the undoped parent
compound EuFe2As2.20 Since magnetic neutron scattering
is sensitive to the moment component perpendicular to Q,
the Eu moments cannot be pointing along the c-axis. Due to
imperfection of the polarization analysis, the strong nuclear
reﬂections (0, 0, 2) and (0, 0, 4) observed in the XNSF
channel also leaked into the XSF channel. No intensity is
observed at (-2, 0, 0) within the experimental resolution,
excluding the possibility of a canted-AFM structure of Eu
with a net ferromagnetic component along the c axis.34 In
addition, magnetic reﬂections at (-1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 3) show
up in the XSF channel, arising from the SDW ordering of the
Fe moments with the propagation vector of k = (1, 0, 1).20
As shown in the inset of Fig. 2, the (0, 0, 3) magnetic re-
ﬂection due to the AFM ordering of Eu disappears completely
at 11 K in the XSF channel. The temperature dependence
of its integrated intensity from the rocking scan is plotted in
Fig. 2, indicating an ordering temperature of TEu= 10.0(5) K,
well consistent with that from the macroscopic measurements.3

Figure 2: The temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of
the (0, 0, 3) magnetic reﬂection in the XSF channel measured at
DNS. The insets show the rocking scan of the (0, 0, 3) peak at 3.5 K
and 11 K, respectively.
The temperature dependence of the integrated intensity, which
is proportional to the square of the order parameter, shows a
very unusual behaviour. Starting with a negative curvature
around TEu, it continues nearly linearly down to the lowest
temperature reached in this experiment. Neither typical crit-
ical behaviour, nor tendency to saturation can be seen. As
discussed below, we attribute this unusual temperature depen-
dence to the interaction between the Eu and Fe sublattices.
The peak intensities of the (1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 3) reﬂections
in the XSF channel, both arising from the SDW ordering of
Fe, were monitored at DNS and plotted using dark spheres
in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively, as a function of the tem-
perature. The onset temperature of the SDW ordering can be
estimated to be TSDW = 192(2) K, consistent with that the
high-temperature anomaly shown in the resistivity and spe-
ciﬁc heat data. Interestingly, both order parameters display a
kink at the AFM ordering temperature of Eu (TEu = 10 K).
Below TEu, the peak intensity of (1 0 1) reﬂection increases
steadily , while (1 0 3) weakens visibly with decreasing tem-
perature. As shown in the insets of Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), rocking
scans of the (1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 3) reﬂections in the XSF chan-
nel indeed show opposite temperature-dependent tendencies.
The temperature dependencies of the integrated intensity of
both reﬂections were also measured at the four-circle neutron
diffractometer HEiDi. The same behaviors were observed as
shown using the open circles in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), further
conﬁrming the different responses of (1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 3)
reﬂections to the AFM ordering of the Eu2+ moments and
suggesting a possible spin-reorientation of the Fe sublattice
below TEu. Fig. 3(a) also shows the temperature dependen-
cies of the integrated intensity and full width at half maxi-
mum (FWHM) of the (4, 0, 0) nuclear reﬂection measured at
HEiDi. The sudden jump of the intensity and broadening of
the peak width indicates the occurrence of a structural phase
transition in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 from a tetragonal (space group
I4/mmm) to an orthorhombic (space group Fmmm) phase
at TS = 191(2) K, coincident with the SDW ordering of Fe at

To better understand the interplay of the magnetism be-
tween Eu and Fe sublattices in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2, the inte-
grated intensities of 357 nuclear reﬂections and 254 magnetic
reﬂections from Eu were collected at HEiDi at the base tem-
perature (2.5 K). In addition, 246 nuclear reﬂections were
collected above TEu (11 K). The obtained data sets at both
temperatures were normalized to the monitor and corrected
by the Lorentz factor. After the absorption correction proce-
dure using the DATAP program taking into account the di-
mensions of the crystal,47 equivalent reﬂections were merged
into the unique ones based on the orthorhombic symmetry.4

The nuclear structures at 2.5 K and 11 K were reﬁned using
FULLPROF.48 As shown in Table 1, the nuclear structure does
not show a visible difference below and above TEu. At 2.5
K, the magnetic reﬂections from Eu can be well ﬁtted using
the A-type AFM structure as conﬁrmed for the parent com-
pound EuFe2As2,20 with the Eu2+ moment as large as 6.74(4)
µB aligned along the orthorhombic a axis. Although the Eu
sites are diluted with isovalent Ca2+ of almost 50 %, the Eu2+
spins are found to be long-range ordered still. This is in good
agreement with a recent µSR study on the same compound,39
and in stark contrast to the short-range magnetic ordering
of Eu proposed for hole-doped Eu0.5K0.5Fe2As2 based on
macroscopic measurements.43
Furthermore, motivated by the intriguing responses of the
magnetic order parameters of Fe in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 at TEu,
the integrated intensities of a few strong magnetic reﬂections
from the Fe sublattice were collected at HEiDi by perform-
ing rocking scans, corrected by the Lorentz factor as well
as the absorption effect.
Fig.4 shows the integrated inten-
sities of four magnetic reﬂections with relatively small sta-
tistical errors, i.e., (1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 3), (1, 2, 1) and (1, 0,
7). The intensities of them at 11 K can be very well ﬁtted
with an in-plane AFM structure of the Fe2+ moment (see Fig.
5(a)), with the moment size of Ma = 1.10(5) µB along the
orthorhombic a axis as calculated using FULLPROF. Both
the moment direction and moment size here are quite simi-
lar to those observed for the parent compound EuFe2As2 in
the ground state.20 However, the intensities at 2.5 K clearly
deviates from those predicted by the in-plane AFM structure.
As neutron diffraction only probes the magnetic moment per-
pendicular to the scattering vector Q, the redistribution of the
magnetic scattering intensities signiﬁes a spin reorientation of
the Fe2+ moments.49 With a canted AFM structure which al-
lows the Fe2+ moments to rotate in the ac plane (see Fig.
5(b)), the intensities at 2.5 K can be well explained with the
moment size Ma = 0.85(5) µB and Mc = 0.22(5) µB. All the
details about the model reﬁnements of the magnetic structure
of Fe were included in the Supplementary Materials.

2.5 K are illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. As
concluded above, at 11 K (slightly above TEu), the Eu sublat-
tice is not magnetically ordered yet while the Fe sublattice
displays an in-plane AFM structure. With further decreas-
ing temperature, the Eu2+ moments start to order, while the
Fe2+ moments tend to rotate towards the c axis within the
ac plane, as reﬂected by the opposite temperature-dependent
tendencies of its magnetic order parameters shown in Fig. 3.
At the reachable base temperature (2,5 K) at HEiDi, the Eu2+
spins are found to align along the a axis in the A-type AFM
structure similar to the undoped parent compound, while the
Fe2+ moments are ordered in a canted AFM structure with a
canting angle of 14(4)° out of the ab plane. In other words, the
spin reorientation of the Fe2+ moments occurs in coincidence
with the AFM ordering of Eu, suggesting a strong interplay
between the two magnetic sublattices in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2.5

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We note that the magnetic order parameter of the Eu sub-
lattice in Fig. 2 does not saturate down to 3.5 K. However,
reﬁnements using the magnetic reﬂections from Eu yield the
moment size of 6.74(4) µB, well consistent with a full mo-
ment of µS = gS = 7 µB expected for the Eu2+ spins with
S = 7/2. This means that the Eu sublattice is fully magnet-
ically ordered at 3.5 K. Thus, the unusual temperature de-
pendence in Fig. 2 is very likely to arise from the change
of the strength of Eu-Fe magnetic interaction concomitant
with the spin reorientation of the Fe2+ spins moments. As
well documented, the coupling between two AFM sublattices
may arise from quantum ﬂuctuations via the so-called “order-
by-disorder” mechanism.50–53 The strong Eu-Fe coupling in
Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2, therefore, might be due to the longitu-
dinal ﬂuctuations of the Eu2+ spins, which lead to a con-
siderable change in the magnetic anisotropy energy and re-
sult in the spin reorientation of the Fe2+ moments. For the
EuFe2As2 system, to the best of our knowledge, our obser-
vation here provides the ﬁrst experimental evidence of spin
reorientation of Fe below the Eu magnetic ordering tempera-
ture. Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2, therefore, exhibits a strong Eu-Fe in-
terplay undoubtly. However, this is not contradictory with the
weak Eu-Fe coupling in the parent compound EuFe2As2,20–22
since it was found that the strength of interplay between
3d and 4f electrons can be tunable by chemical doping.54
Compared with undoped EuFe2As2, the out-of-plane lattice
constant c shrinks considerably by ~ 1 % upon 50 % Ca
substitution.
As a result, the neareast Eu-Fe distance re-
duces by 0.7% from 3.591 Å (in EuFe2As2) to 3.567 Å (in
Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2), favoring a stronger Eu-Fe spin interac-
tion. Further theoretical studies on Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2 will be
very helpful for understanding its intriguing magnetic proper-
ties and strong Eu-Fe interplay in it.
In conclusion, using complementary polarized and un-
polarized single-crystal neutron diffraction, we have inves-
tigated the temperature-dependent magnetic structures of
Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2. Upon 50 % dilution of the Eu sites with
isovalent Ca2+, the Eu sublattice is found to be still long-
range ordered below TEu = 10 K, in the A-typed AFM struc-
ture. The moment size of Eu2+ spins is estimated to be as
large as 6.74(4) µB at 2.5 K. The Fe sublattice undergoes a
SDW transition at TSDW = 192(2) K and displays an in-plane
AFM structure above TEu. However, at 2.5 K, the Fe2+ mo-
ments are found to be ordered in a canted AFM structure with
a canting angle of 14(4)° out of the ab plane. The spin re-
orientation of Fe below the AFM ordering temperature of Eu
provides a direct evidence of a strong interplay between the
two magnetic sublattices in Eu0.5Ca0.5Fe2As2.
