Abstract: The emerging Au-assisted exfoliation technique provides a wealth of 
large-area and high-quality ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials compared with 
traditional tape-based exfoliation. Fast, damage-free, and reliable determination of the 
layer number of such 2D films is essential to study layer-dependent physics and 
promote device applications. Here, an optical method has been developed for simple, 
high throughput, and accurate determination of the layer number for Au-assisted 
exfoliated MoS2 and WS2 films in a broad thickness range. The method is based on 
quantitative analysis of layer-dependent white light reflection spectra, revealing that 
the reflection peak intensity can be used as a clear indicator for determining the layer 
number. The simple yet robust method will facilitate the fundamental study on 
layer-dependent optical, electrical, and thermal properties and device applications of 
2D materials. The technique can also be readily combined with photoluminescence 
and Raman spectroscopies to study other layer-dependent physical properties of 2D 
materials.  
1. Introduction 
Two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS2,2 
 
WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, have attracted much attention due to their unique optical, 
electrical, thermal, mechanical and spin properties[1-11], which are highly dependent on 
the layer number of the van der Waals structures. Mechanical exfoliation has been the 
most commonly used method to obtain high-quality single-crystalline monolayer and 
few-layer 2D materials, although the exfoliated sample size is quite limited.[12] Very 
recently, a novel Au-assisted mechanical exfoliation technique has emerged that can 
be applied to dozens of 2D crystals.[13-18] Using this method, not only high quality 
millimeter-size or even centimeter-size 2D TMDCs monolayers can be obtained, but 
separated large-area few-layer nanoflakes, which are needed in hybrid functional 
devices in photodetection and photocatalysis,[19-23] can also be acquired. Within these 
large-area nanoflakes, there usually exist abundant regions of different thicknesses 
varying by monolayer and easy to distinguish, which is otherwise difficult to achieve 
in tape-exfoliated samples. This type of nanoflakes provides an excellent platform for 
the investigation of layer-dependent physics and for the demonstration of 
proof-of-concepts devices, for which reason the Au-assisted exfoliation technique is 
stimulating the growing interest of the 2D community. For either purpose, it is 
essential to determine the thicknesses of as exfoliated plentiful nanofilms rapidly, 
reliably and non-destructively. 
So far, a variety of thickness identification techniques of 2D nanofilms have been 
exploited, including atomic force microscopy (AFM),[12] scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM),[24] transmission electron microscopy (TEM),[25] scanning 
tunnelling microscopy (STM),[26] Raman spectroscopy,[27-29] photoluminescence (PL) 
spectroscopy,[5] and optical microscopy (OM).[24, 30-40] Among these techniques, AFM 
is most widely used to directly measure the thickness of 2D nanoflakes with small 
size, but it is time-consuming and low-throughput for large area films. Moreover, 
AFM is a contact method that can potentially induce structural defects[41] and the 
measured results might be affected by the absorbed water layer. Electron microscopy 
(SEM, TEM, STM) is not only time-consuming and costly, but may also introduce 
pollution or damage due to electron beam induced deposition or atomic 
displacement.[42-43] Raman and PL spectroscopies can identify TMDCs nanofilms 
quickly; however, their applications are normally rather limited to distinguishing very 
thin samples between 1-6L[5, 27] because these two spectroscopy techniques are based 
on the layer dependence of the lattice structure or electronic structure, which are close 
to bulk for thick samples. Moreover, PL spectroscopy generally fails for Au-assisted 
exfoliated TMDCs nanofilms due to PL quenching induced by additional nonradiative 
recombination paths.[44] In view of all this, a high-throughput, high-accuracy 
methodology for thickness determination needs to be developed for large area films 
with various thicknesses.3 
 
Intriguingly, Optical microscopy (OM) is a simple, reliable, non-contact and 
non-destructive technique that enables rapid and high-throughput characterization of 
large area 2D nanofilms. The OM method is mainly divided into two categories:[45] 
one is based on the apparent color of the samples[24, 30-33] and the other is based on 
optical contrast.[34-40] The color-based OM approach requires complex calculations 
and depends sensitively on the light source and the substrate.[33] The optical contrast 
based approach uses either the optical contrast between the 2D material and the 
substrate measured from the images’ RGB channels[38-40] or the wavelength dependent 
optical contrast spectra.[34-37] The RGB method faces challenges in determining 
precise thickness variations, especially in regions with infinitesimal contrast variation 
due to the low spectral resolution provided by the RGB filters.[46] Contrarily, with the 
help of the grating, the spectroscopy technique can provide complete information on 
the spectral dependence of optical contrast in the visible light band. It is worth noting 
that in addition to determining the thickness, the optical contrast spectra can also be 
used to study the optical properties of 2D materials, such as the band gap, excitonic 
effects, dielectric function and absorption spectra.[47-50] It can further be extended to 
detecting strain, interlayer charge transfer, stacking order, and twisted angle of 2D 
materials as these factors can affect the electronic band structure.[51-54] 
In this work, we introduce a novel method that can successfully combine the 
advantages of existing optical techniques to accurately determine the thickness of 
TMDCs nanofilms. By choosing the highly controllable reflection spectra 
measurement mode of the Raman spectrometer, no additional instruments are needed 
and comprehensive layer-dependent white light reflection spectra with more precise 
and richer information can be obtained. With high-resolution and wide-range spectra, 
a series of exciton-induced reflection peaks from MoS2 and WS2 nanofilms were 
observed, whose both peak positions and intensities have obvious thickness 
dependence. From the quantitative analysis of intensities of both reflection peaks from 
samples and emission peaks from the LED light source, we have proposed a reliable 
and broad-range thickness determination method of TMDCs films that simply uses 
the reflection peak intensity without complicated data processing. Fresnel theory 
based theoretical calculations of layer-dependent reflectance, which show good 
agreement with our experimental results, revealed that the physical origin of this 
method is the classical interference effect. The reliability, generalizability and 
advantages of the method have been verified by AFM and Raman measurements. 
2. Results and discussion 
The optical microscope images of Au-assisted mechanical exfoliated large area4 
 
MoS2 nanofilms with various thickness regions (1-15L, confirmed by AFM 
measurements in Figure S1) are shown in Figure 1a-c. The white light reflection 
spectra (WLRS) in the range of 400-950 nm were measured by a Raman spectrometer 
(see the Experimental Section for details). The white light focal spot radius was 
determined to be 1.72 ± 0.03 µm by the knife edge method[9, 50, 55] (Figure S2). Figure 
1d shows a WLRS mapping on a MoS2 nanofilm with 1-5L regions; the clear 
boundaries between different regions and the uniform color gamut of the same 
thickness region indicate the high spatial resolution and good repeatability of this 
method, respectively. The layer-dependent WLRS measured from MoS2 nanofilms as 
well as from the Au/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate (see the Experimental Section for details, 
abbreviated as the Au substrate in the following) are shown in Figure 1e (1-10L). The 
WLRS of 1-35L MoS2 in the Supporting Information reveals that each region with a 
different layer number has a unique reflection spectral fingerprint. This is unlike the 
color-based method that may generate indistinguishable colors for regions with 
minimal layer number difference or even periodic color changes upon certain 
thickness variations.[30, 56] In the reflection spectra of the bare Au substrate, the three 
peaks located at 450, 605, and 900 nm correspond to the three emission peaks of the 
LED light source equipped with the Raman spectrometer, and the peak at 605 nm is 
labeled as peak O (Orange). For the reflection spectra from the MoS2 nanofilms, three 
additional peaks appear. The two lowest energy peaks (~1.79 and 1.92 eV) correspond 
to the A and B excitons associated with interband transitions between the maximum of 
the split valence bands induced by spin-orbit coupling and the minimum of the 
conduction band at the K and K´ point in the Brillouin zone.[57] The broad response at 
higher photon energy (~2.36 eV) consists of six nearly degenerate exciton states made 
from transition occurs between the K and Γ points of the BZ and is denoted by C in 
Figure 1e.[57] The above assignment is also consistent with the results of the 
differential reflectance spectra (Figure S3). The positions and intensities of peaks A, B, 
and C all change as the layer number of MoS2 increases. Specifically, the positions of 
all three peaks are red-shifted as the MoS2 thickness increases due to 
quantum-confinement[58] and optical inteference.[24] However, the intensities of the 
three peaks have different evolving trends. For 1-3L MoS2, peaks A and B are barely 
visible due to interlayer charge transfer in the utra-thin MoS2-Au hybrid structure as 
we previously reported.[51] Beyond 3L, the intensities of both peaks decrease 
monotonously with the increase of sample thickness. In contrast, the intensity of peak 
C increases monotonously as shown in Figure 1f. More importantly, when the 
thickness is greater than 5L, the intensity of peak C increases almost linearly with a 
slope of 0.052, suggesting that it can be used for accurate layer number determination, 
especially for thicker MoS2 nanofilms. The thickness dependence of the reflected light5 
 
intensity will be discussed in detail later.

peak intensity of the substrate reflection spectra. g) Reflection peak intensity ratios of 
O/C, B/C, A/C, and C/O. 
 
For 1-5L MoS2, although the intensity of reflection peak C increases 
monotonously, the increase is still too slow to be conducive for accurate thickness 
determination. We noticed that when the thickness of MoS2 increases, the positions of 
the O emission peak of the LED light source do not change, while the intensity 
decreases significantly first (1-9L) and then increases (> 9L) with the increase of the 
MoS2 thickness. And it can be used to accurately determine the layer number of 1-7L 
MoS2, which cannot be easily distinguished by peak C. Once the 1-7L MoS2 is 
determined by peak O, the slope of the linear increase region in the intensity of peak 
C can then be determined and used to accurately identify the layer number of thicker 
MoS2 films. Moreover, we note that the peak intensity ratio between peak O and peak 
C (O/C) shown in Figure 1g can also be used to accurately determine the thickness of 
1-9L MoS2, whose distinguishing effect far exceeds the Raman frequency difference 
method shown later (Figure 3b). 
To test the thickness limit that can be determined using this method, we probe its 
sensitivity by measuring thicker MoS2 nanoflakes (16-35L, confirmed by AFM 
measurements in the Supporting Information) as shown in Figure 2a-c. Based on the6 
 
analysis of the thickness determination of 1-15L MoS2, we now only focus on the 
intensities of peaks C and O in the following discussion. As shown in Figure 2e, for 
the 16-35L MoS2, the linear relationship between the intensity of peak C and the 
sample thickness remains. Therefore, for 5-35L MoS2, its thickness can be accurately 
determined by the intensity of the peak C. As for the peak O, there is a small jump in 
its intensity at 22L. This is due to the fact that the reflection spectra of the 22L MoS2 
has a flat band in the 540-575 nm range and the position of peak O is obviously 
shifted before and after this thickness (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information 
for details).

To explain the thickness dependence of the reflected light intensity, the 
reflectance of the MoS2/Au/Ti/SiO2/Si quintuple layer system (shown in Figure 2d) 
has been calculated based on Fresnel's theory. On top of the unsupported thin film, 
which can be equivalent to a double-layer system with membrane on semi-infinite air 
layer,[59] the reflectance of the quintuple layer system in our work can be calculated 
using the recursive method (see Note S1 in the Supporting Information for details of 
calculation)7

where ri=(ni-1-ni)/(ni-1+ni) is the Fresnel reflection coefficients at the interface from 
medium i-1 to i; the indices are assigned as air (0), MoS2 (1), Au (2), Ti (3), SiO2 (4), 
and Si (5). ni is the complex refractive index of the ith layer with n0 = 1. βi = 2πnidi/λ 
is the phase factor, representing the phase differences through the whole medium i, 
where di is the thickness of medium i. The thickness of the MoS2 nanofilm is 
estimated by d = NΔd, where N represents the layer number and Δd is the thickness of 
monolayer MoS2 (0.615 nm).[60] The material thicknesses and wavelength dependent 
refractive indices of Au (d2, n2), Ti (d3, n3), SiO2 (d4, n4), Si (semi-infinite, n5), MoS2 
and WS2 (bulk, n1) were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement as 
we previously reported[51] and were also shown in Figure S5 and Table S1. Given that 
the positions of excitonic peaks (A, B, and C) change significantly with the MoS2 
thickness, while the position of the peak O is almost unchanged, we calculated 
layer-dependent reflectance of our system at 610 nm as shown in Figure 2f, which is 
in good agreement with the measured reflectance. The slight difference between the 
two may be due to the layer-dependent dielectric function of few layer MoS2 revealed 
by our layer-dependent differential reflectance spectra in Figure 1g and Figure S6, 
which may be slightly different from the bulk value used in our calculations. 
Nevertheless, the overall consistency indicates that the layer dependence of reflected 
peak intensity mainly originates from classical interference effects.8 
 
We want to note that many systematic studies on the layer-dependent physical 
properties can be carried out once the layer number of the Au-assisted exfoliated 2D 
films is determined. For example (and most conveniently), the layer-dependent 
dielectric function can be obtained from the measured differential reflectance spectra 
by the Kramers-Kronig constrained analysis.[61] The differential reflectance spectra of 
the 1-3L MoS2 supported on both the Au substrate and the SiO2/Si substrate are 
shown in Figure 2g to get a preliminary understanding of the characteristics of 2D 
films-Au hybrid system’s layer-dependent dielectric function. Since the Au substrate 
can provide large strain and promote the interlayer charge transfer at the Au/2D films 
interface,[51-52] the optical properties of the 2D films-Au hybrid system are different 
from the intrinsic ones as revealed in Figure 2g and from our previous ellipsometric 
study on the 1L MoS2-Au hybrid system.[51] Nevertheless, the systematic study of the 
layer-dependent dielectric function of the hybrid system still requires future efforts, 
which is not the focus of this article. In addition, the Au substrate facilitates the 
measurement of electron-based characterizations, such as scanning tunneling 
microscopy (STM),[15] angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES),[62] and 
conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM),[63] which will in turn promote the study 
of layer-dependent electronic band structures and electrical transport properties. 
To further verify the reliability of our method to determine the layer number, we 
benchmark it against the commonly used Raman spectroscopy. PL spectroscopy is not 
used for benchmarking as the PL signal is quenched for MoS2 on Au due to interlayer 
charge transfer (see the thickness-dependent PL spectra in Figure S7). Figure 3a 
shows the layer-dependent Raman spectra of 1-15L MoS2. In principle, the frequency 
difference between the 𝐸2𝑔
1  and 𝐴1𝑔 modes is anticipated to increase monotonously 
with the layer number and can be used to distinguish 1-6L MoS2.[27] In the case of 
MoS2 on Au, however, the abnormally large frequency difference of 1L MoS2 is due 
to the large red shift of the 𝐸2𝑔
1  mode caused by the large strain provided by the Au 
film as we have previously reported.[51] Nevertheless, the frequency differences 
obtained from MoS2 on Au are consistent with the values from MoS2 on SiO2/Si for 
2-6L MoS2. This gives the same layer numbers as our reflection peak intensity method. 
Figure 3c shows the layer-dependent Raman intensities of MoS2 and Si (~ 520 cm-1). 
The Raman intensities of the 𝐴1𝑔 and 𝐸2𝑔
1  modes both reach the maximum value at 
9 L and then drop with increasing thickness due to optical interference; the layer 
number where the maximum Raman intensity appears depends on the specific optical 
structure of the multilayer system.[64] The Raman intensity ratios of the MoS2 𝐴1𝑔9 
 
and 𝐸2𝑔
1  modes to the Si mode are also plotted in Figure 3d. Compared with the 
frequency difference in Figure 3b and the intensities in Figure 3c, the Raman intensity 
ratio presents a clearer linear dependence on the layer number in a wider thickness 
range (~15L). Particularly, the distinguishing effect of 𝐴1𝑔/𝑆𝑖 is better than that of 
𝐸2𝑔
1 /𝑆𝑖 due to its better linearity and larger slope as revealed by the linear fits in 
Figure 3d. However, as the layer number of MoS2 further increases, the fluctuation 
and saturation of data points make the Raman based metrics no longer effective as 
shown in the yellow regions in Figure 3d. In fact, the Raman frequency difference and 
intensities are usually effective only in distinguishing 1-6L MoS2 with high accuracy. 
In comparison, our reflected peak intensity method exhibits great advantages in a 
much larger layer number identification range (at least 30L) with higher accuracy for 
thicker films.

The effectiveness of this method should in principle apply to other TMDCs, so 
we extended this method to WS2. Figure 4a-c shows the OM images of Au-assisted 
exfoliated large area 1-17L WS2 nanofilms (confirmed by AFM measurements in the 
Supporting Information). The layer-dependent WLRS of 1-10L WS2 is shown in 
Figure 4e (see Figure S9 for reflection spectra of 1-18L WS2). Different from those of 
MoS2, there are only two distinct sample peaks in the reflection spectra of WS2 as one 
of the sample peaks (peak B) overlaps with O peak .[65-66] Other than that, the peak 
intensity and peak position both change significantly with the thickness of WS2 
similar to MoS2. The normalized reflection peak intensities of A, C, and O peaks 
collected from 1-18L WS2 are shown in Figure 4f. The intensity of peak A decreases 
monotonously while that of peak C increases monotonously with the increase of 
sample thickness and these two peaks are almost indistinguishable for monolayer and 
bilayer WS2. Notably, when the thickness of WS2 nanofilm is greater than 7L, the 
intensity of peak C increases almost linearly with a slightly larger slope of 0.0527 
than MoS2 (0.0522). As for peak O, the intensity decreases first and then increases 
with a minimum value at 14L, which is larger that of MoS2 (9L) due to the different 
optical constants of the two materials (Figure S5). Moreover, the intensity of peak O 
changes significantly for 1-9L WS2. Therefore, for WS2 with a thickness of 1-7L and 
more than 7L, the number of layers can be accurately determined by the intensity of 
peak O and peak C, respectively. We also calculated the layer-dependent reflectance 
of WS2 on the Au substrate at 605 nm, and once again it is in good agreement with the 
experiment as shown in Figure 4g, which further reveals the reliability of our WLRS 
based method for thickness determination.11

Although the emerging Au-assisted exfoliation technique has shown great 
advantages in the preparation of large-area single-crystalline 2D thin films including 
monolayers, tape-based mechanical exfoliation remains an important method owing to 
its feasibility and flexibility for dry transfer after exfoliation. Therefore, we also made 
a theoretical prediction on the thickness determination on tape-exfoliated and 
tranferred TMDCs films. The calculated layer-dependent reflectances of MoS2 and 
WS2 supported on the SiO2 (272.7 and 310.4 nm)/Si and Au/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates at 
605 nm are shown in Figure 5. Obviously, the WLRS based method is also applicable 
to traditional tape-exfoliated films as the principle of the method is the classical 
interference effect, and this method retains broad range of application in different 
situations. However, compared with the SiO2/Si substrate, the Au substrate can 
determine the thickness of a thicker film and it is easy to distinguish ultra-thin few 
layer films, because peak G has a large drop interval at the beginning. In addition, the 
difference in thickness dependent reflectivity of MoS2 and WS2 is obvious for the Au 
substrate (not caused by slight differences in oxide layer thickness, Figure S10), while 
the two materials are almost the same for the SiO2/Si substrate. As for the two SiO2/Si 
substrates we chose, the one with 270 nm oxide layer is more suitable for thickness 
judgment. Because for the substrate with 310 nm oxide layer, peak G has a very 
narrow drop range, which is not conducive for the distinction of few layer samples. In 
short, regarding the effectiveness of the WLRS method to determine the layer number,12 
 
the Au substrate is better than the SiO2 (270 nm)/Si substrate and the SiO2 (270 
nm)/Si substrate is better than the SiO2 (310 nm)/Si substrate.

3. Conclusions 
In summary, a simple, fast yet reliable optical method is proposed to determine 
the layer number of MoS2 and WS2 films prepared by Au-assisted mechanical 
exfoliation, which is an emerging technique to obtain large area and high quality 
TMDCs. The method takes advantage of the reflection intensities of the sample peaks 
(A, B, and C) and the 605 nm peak of the white LED (peak O) which exhibit clear 
evolving patterns with the layer number. Specifically, the intensity of reflection peaks 
O and C can be used as a clear indicator for precise identification of layer number of 
ultra-thin and thicker films, respectively. We have benchmarked this white light 
reflection spectra method with other commonly used techniques such as AFM and 
Raman spectroscopy, finding an excellent agreement. Calculations based on Fresnel 
theory show that this method is based on optical interference; it thus has a large 
identification range of more than 30 layers and is also applicable for traditional 
tape-exfoliated TMDCs films. The simple and robust optical identification method 
will facilitate the fundamental study on layer-dependent physical properties and 
demonstration of proof-of-concepts devices based on TMDCs. Moreover, the 
spectroscopy-based method is readily integrated with Raman and PL measurements 
for the simultaneous study of other physical properties.13 
 
4. Experimental details and methods 
Gold-Assisted Exfoliation: The SiO2/Si wafers were sonicated for 25 min each in 
acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and then dried with a nitrogen gun. PVD metal films 
were prepared with a DC magnetron sputtering system (Kurt J. Lesker CMS-A) at 
room temperature under a 5 SCCM Ar flow at partial pressure of 10−3 Torr. A Ti 
adhesion layer was first deposited on SiO2/Si wafer, and then Au film was deposited. 
Both metal layers were deposited for 1 min at a power of 100 W (for Ti) and 60 W 
(for Au), respectively. MoS2 and WS2 were cleaved from bulk crystals (purchased 
from Shanghai ONWAY technology Co., Ltd) with scotch-tape and then pressed onto 
the freshly prepared Au substrate. The stack was annealed on a hotplate in ambient 
conditions at 180 ℃ for 60 s and taken from the hotplate to cool down for 10–20 s 
before peeling the tape. Large-area monolayer and few layer flakes can be obtained 
after the tape was removed.  
Raman, Photoluminescence and Reflection Spectra Measurements: Raman, 
photoluminescence spectra and white light reflection spectra were collected on a 
Renishaw InVia Raman Microscope system. When collecting the white light 
reflection spectra, a white LED source was used and the edge filter in the signal light 
path was removed. The light intensity of the white light source can be automatically 
and accurately controlled, so the experimental results of different batches have 
excellent repeatability. Raman and photoluminescence spectra were obtained in a 
back scattering geometry with a 532 nm excitation laser. A 100× objective lens with 
NA = 0.85 and a 1800 lines/mm grating were used to collect Raman, 
photoluminescence signals and reflected white light.  
Characterization of Samples and Substrates: The thicknesses of the MoS2 and 
WS2 films were determined by AFM (Bruker Dimension ICON). The dielectric 
functions of bulk MoS2 and WS2 and the actual thicknesses of SiO2, Ti, and Au layers 
as well as their dielectric functions were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry 
measurements (J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.)

Calculation of the reflectance of the quintuple layer system 
19 
The reflectance of the quintuple layer system can be calculated using the recursive 
20 
method based on the reflectance of the bilayer system. 
21 
For an unsupported thin film (can be regarded as a bilayer system with thin film and 
22 
semi-infinite air layer), the normal incidence reflectance 𝑅′′(λ) is given by[1] 
23 
𝑅′′(λ) = |𝑟′′(λ)|2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
              (S1) 
24 
the reflection coefficient is 
25 
𝑟′′(λ) =
𝑟1+𝑟2𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1
1+𝑟1𝑟2𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  (S2) 
26 
For trilayer system, such as thin film/SiO2/Si system, the reflection coefficient 𝑟′′′(λ) 
27 
can be iteratively obtained by the method shown below on the basis of 𝑟′′(λ) 
28 
𝑟′′′(λ) =
𝑟1+( 𝑟2+𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2
1+𝑟2𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2)𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1
1+𝑟1( 𝑟2+𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2
1+𝑟2𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2)𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1 =
𝑟1𝑒2𝑖𝛽1+𝑟2+𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟1𝑟2𝑟3𝑒2𝑖(𝛽1−𝛽2)
𝑒2𝑖𝛽1+𝑟1𝑟2+𝑟1𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟2𝑟3𝑒2𝑖(𝛽1−𝛽2)  
 
(S3) 
29 
Modification of the equation S3 (multiplying the numerator and denominator by the 
30 
factor 𝑒−𝑖(𝛽1−𝛽2) at the same time), the common form in the literature[2] can be 
31 
obtained. 
32 
 
33 
Similarly, the reflection coefficient of the quadralayer system 𝑟′′′′(λ) is 
34 
𝑟′′′′(λ) =
𝑟1+(𝑟2𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟3+𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟2𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3)
𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟2𝑟3+𝑟2𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3))𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1
1+𝑟1(𝑟2𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟3+𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟2𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3)
𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟2𝑟3+𝑟2𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3))𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1 =
35 
𝑟1𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟2𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽1)+𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1+𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖(𝛽1+𝛽3)+𝑟1𝑟2𝑟3+𝑟1𝑟2𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟1𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3)+𝑟2𝑟3𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖(𝛽1−𝛽2+𝛽3)
𝑒2𝑖𝛽2+𝑟1𝑟2𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽1)+𝑟1𝑟3𝑒−2𝑖𝛽1+𝑟1𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖(𝛽1+𝛽3)+𝑟2𝑟3+𝑟2𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖𝛽3+𝑟3𝑟4𝑒2𝑖(𝛽2−𝛽3)+𝑟1𝑟2𝑟3𝑟4𝑒−2𝑖(𝛽1−𝛽2+𝛽3)

                                                           (S4) 
37 
For quintlayer system, the reflection coefficient 𝑟′′′′′(λ) is 
38 
𝑟′′′′′(λ) =
39
