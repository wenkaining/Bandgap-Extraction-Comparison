We have studied Pb thin ﬁlms as a function of the thickness up to 60 monolayers (MLs)
using ab initio ﬁrst principles and model calculations. Magic heights corresponding to a
modulated oscillatory pattern of the energy of Pb(111) ﬁlms have been measured up to
about 30 MLs. We demonstrate that this behaviour continues even for higher thickness
due to an extra second modulation pattern in the energetics of the metal ﬁlm as a function
of the number of atomic layers. The origin of this second modulation is the nesting of
two close values of the Fermi wavelength in the (111) direction.

1. Introduction
Quantum size eﬀects (QSEs) are a key issue to understand the physical properties of
nanostructures. They show up in the stability of clusters or nanowires, which is favored
for some values of their radius, so-called ”magic”[ 1, 2]. This behaviour has been shown
to aﬀect also the growth of islands or thin ﬁlms over surfaces. In particular these eﬀects
are very strong for Pb(111) ﬁlms, which can form wide ﬂat ﬁlms of preferred thickness.
Monitoring the growth of Pb nanoislands over Cu(111) [ 3] or Si(111) [ 4] with diﬀerent
experimental techniques (such as He atom scattering (HAS) [ 5], Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy (STM)[ 3], photoemission and Surface X-ray diﬀraction) has revealed the
preference of Pb for bi-layer growth [ 6].
The origin of the ”magic” height selection is easy to understand qualitatively with a sim-
ple picture of electrons conﬁned in a potential well [ 7]: valence electrons ﬁll paraboloidal
subbands and, as the thickness of the slab is increased new quantum well states are occu-
pied, producing oscillations in the energy and related physical properties with periodicity
λF/2 (λF is the Fermi wavelength of electrons in Pb). When the interlayer spacing (d)
of Pb in the (111) direction is considered, the approximate relation d ≈3λF/4 gives rise
to a beat pattern superimposed to the oscillations [ 8, 6] with an even-odd change in the
magic number of atomic layers at the beats. The energy minima can be related to the
magic or more stable thicknesses measured in the experiments. A quantitative descrip-
tion of the measured magic sizes, on the other hand, requires more sophisticated models.
In some studies the support has been included to provide an accurate description of the
experiments [ 8, 9, 10]. There are several theoretical works devoted to the study of QSEs2
in thin ﬁlms within the density functional theory (DFT). In this paper, we explore larger
sizes (up to 60 MLs) of Pb thin ﬁlms than considered in the literature by using ab ini-
tio calculations, which include the atomic structure of Pb ﬁlms. We ﬁnd a second extra
modulation of the oscillations in the energetics of the thin ﬁlms and explore the origin of
this new modulation and its eﬀect on the stability at higher coverages than measured up
to now.
2. Ab initio ﬁrst principles calculations
We have analized the stability of free-standing Pb(111) ﬁlms as a function of the num-
ber of monolayers (N), up to N=60 ML, taking into account the atomic structure. As
the stability is given by the energy of the slabs, we have calculated ﬁrst the total energy
as a function of N. In this study we are not interested in the quantitative agreement
with the experiments, but on the amplitude and the general trend of the oscillations for
thicker ﬁlms than studied up to now (N >30). Previous jellium calculations [ 8] studied
the eﬀect of the support, but in that approach only one value of the Fermi wave vector is
involved, i.e., a spherical Fermi surface is assumed. The support can introduce a shift of
these oscillations but this is not the topic of our work. The key of ab initio calculations
is that they provide a more realistic description of the Fermi surface.
Our calculations have been performed with the VASP code [ 11] by using the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) [ 12] for the exchange-correlation potential and the projec-
tor augmented-wave method (PAW) [ 13]. Convergence of the energies versus plane-wave
cutoﬀ(237 eV), k-mesh (22x22), and vacuum (10 ML) have been chosen to get high accu-
racy. These values are in agreement with reference [ 14]. Previous ab initio calculations
for a small number of layers included the lattice relaxation [ 15], but we have considered
bulk distances between atoms. This relaxation would aﬀect only the position of the ﬁrst
beat, and it is not so important for the present study.
To analyse the stability we have calculated the second derivative of the energy versus the
number of monolayers. The results are shown in Fig. 1 with continuous line. Notice the
minus sign, so that the minima correspond to stable ﬁlms, as in previous jellium calcula-
tions. With the aim of comparing with the 1/D2 damping of the oscillations reported by
jellium calculations [ 16], we have multiplied the second derivative of the energy times the
square of the slab thickness. First of all we observe modulated oscillations, like ”packets”,
with a period of about 8 ML. Between these ”packets” there are beats with an even-odd
slip in the magic thickness. This trend is similar to the jellium results reported in the
literature. For N <10 ML there are slight diﬀerences, the ﬁrst beat is moved upwards.
The interface properties with the substrate and the relaxation eﬀects also can aﬀect at
these coverages, but we are not interested in that region [ 8, 9]. For larger coverages we
observe a stronger damping in the ab initio result than the inverse square law observed
for jellium. In addition, the distance between beats changes. This is more evident for
N >30 ML, and around 40 ML the period decreases to about 6.4 ML.
3. Comparison with analytical models
Jellium model calculations assume one value of the Fermi wavelength, close to 7.5 a0 for
Pb(111). Within that model, the energy oscillations times the square eﬀective thickness3
(Deff) of the ﬁlm can be ﬁtted to a simple sinusoidal expression which reproduces the
beat pattern:
σoscD2
eff = sin[2kF(dN + δ0)]
(1)
where δ0 is a surface shift that accounts for the charge spill-out at the surfaces, d is the
interlayer spacing, and N is the number of layers.
Our ab initio results could not be ﬁtted with expression (1), i.e, using one value of kF
in the whole thickness range, but we succeeded to ﬁt nicely the ab initio values with a
superposition of two sinusoidal expressions for two very close values of kF. We tried the
following analytical description of Fig. 1:
A1 sin[2kF 1(dN + δ0)] + A1 sin[2kF 2(dN + δ0)]
(2)
where kF 1 and kF 2 are two close Fermi wave vectors in the (111) direction and A1
and A2 are their corresponding weights. The ﬁt to such expression using λF 1=7.47a0,
λF 1=7.54a0, A1=0.72 and A2=1.28 is really good. The result is an extra modulation over
the ﬁrst modulation, which gives the ”packets” and ﬁrst beats described by one value of
kF. This second modulation produces an extra second quantum beat, responsible for the
stability at coverages over 30 MLs. The values of kF used for the ﬁtting to the analytical
expression (2) are very close to the values reported in the literature. The second Fermi
wavelength arises because the section of the Fermi surface for Pb is not circular but has
a butterﬂy shape [ 17, 3], as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. In a diﬀerent context, the devi-
ation of the Fermi surface from the spherical shape has been found to aﬀect the magnetic
interlayer coupling in multilayers, being important for distances as long as 100 MLs [ 18].
The values of the nesting wavelengths underlying the oscillations obtained with ab initio
calculations are extracted from their Fourier transform, plotted in Fig. 2 with continuous
line. In the same plot we show the peaks corresponding to the analytical expressions that
assume one (dotted line) and two (dashed line) Fermi wavevectors given by equations (1)
and (2) respectively. We notice that both beat frequencies for the analytical model of
equation (2) have merged into a broad peak in the ab initio calculations. In part this is
due to the actual window of layer sizes.
In the inset of Fig. 2, the behaviour of the oscillations with one kF (circular section of
Fermi surface) is shown as compared to the two kF nesting behaviour, corresponding to
the butterﬂy like section of the Fermi surface. The one kF case produces a modulated
oscillating structure, but the two kF plot gives a more rich pattern with a second modu-
lation. In that sketch, two kF values with the same weight have been considered, so that
the second quantum beat is clearly distinguished, and it is not accompanied by a slip
from even to odd at that beat. This sketch explains already the origin and the trend of
the ab initio results displayed in Fig. 1, but is not exactly the same, due to the diﬀerent
weights of the wave vectors.
4. Conclusions
We have shown that there are new features (a second modulation structure) in the
quantum oscillations of Pb thin ﬁlms at high coverages (N >30 ML), about the bor-
derline of the thickness explored by experiments up to now. We have obtained a good4
description of the energy oscillations obtained with ab initio calculations ( N <60 ML)
using sinusoidal expressions with two similar nesting Fermi wavelengths. The agreement
is not good in the whole thickness range studied when only one value of the Fermi wave-
length is considered. The second modulation of the energy oscillations would account for
the magic stability of thin ﬁlms at high coverages. Anyway, more experiments would be
helpful at higher coverages (N >30 ML) in order to check this eﬀect.
