Transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 have attracted enormous in-
terest during recent years. They are van-der-Waals crystals with highly anisotropic properties, which
allows exfoliation of individual layers. Their remarkable physical properties make them promising
for applications in optoelectronic, spintronic, and valleytronic devices. Phonons are fundamental
to many of the underlying physical processes, like carrier and spin relaxation or exciton dynamics.
However, experimental data of the complete phonon dispersion relations in these materials is miss-
ing. Here we present the phonon dispersion of bulk MoS2 in the high-symmetry directions of the
Brillouin zone, determined by inelastic X-ray scattering. Our results underline the two-dimensional
nature of MoS2. Supported by ﬁrst-principles calculations, we determine the phonon displacement
patterns, symmetry properties, and scattering intensities. The results will be the basis for future
experimental and theoretical work regarding electron-phonon interactions, intervalley scattering, as
well as phonons in related 2D materials.
Lattice dynamics constitute one of the most fundamen-
tal properties of a crystal, being the basis for mechani-
cal and elastic properties, thermal transport as well as
charge-carrier dynamics, phonon-assisted optical excita-
tions and many more. In this view, it is highly desired to
have reliable data about the phonon dispersion relation of
MoS2, a layered crystal that has boosted the new research
ﬁeld of two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene
during recent years [1–4]. This is due to its fascinating
physical properties in single-layer form, which it shares
with related transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
like MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, or MoTe2 [5–8]. Many of their
physical processes relevant for new applications [9, 10],
such as carrier and exciton dynamics [6, 11, 12], decay
of so-called valley polarization [13–15] (the selective pop-
ulation of one of the two inequivalent K points in the
Brillouin zone [16]), electron-phonon coupling in super-
conducting states [17, 18], and relaxation of spins [19],
crucially depend on phonons. For example, phonons with
considerably large wave vector are required for optical
absorption and emission from the indirect band gap in
few-layer and bulk TMDCs. They are the relevant source
for electron scattering in electron transport [20] and are
expected to play a signiﬁcant role in the formation of
momentum-space indirect interlayer excitons in van-der-
Waals heterostructures [21, 22].
In MoS2 and other TMDCs, however, experimental
data on the full phonon dispersion are missing. Only one
high-symmetry direction of the Brillouin zone in MoS2
has been accessed so far by inelastic neutron scattering
(INS) [23].
However, the part most relevant for scat-
tering with large phonon wave vectors q or between the
inequivalent points K and K′ (i.e., between the valleys)
is completely missing and has been addressed by calcu-
lations only so far, e.g., in Refs. [24–26]. The same holds
for the other TMDCs, which have in common, as an ob-
stacle for INS experiments, the in-plane nature of the
phonon dispersion and the lack of large single crystals.
Here we present the entire phonon dispersion rela-
tion of MoS2 in the high-symmetry directions Γ −K,
Γ −M, K −M, and Γ −A of the Brillouin zone as
determined by inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) exper-
iments.
We show the existence of almost degenerate
Davydov pairs throughout the Brillouin zone, as well as
nearly quadratic dispersion of the out-of-plane acoustic
modes (ﬂexural modes), underlining the two-dimensional
nature of MoS2. Our results are further substantiated by
density-functional theory calculations and simulations of
the structure factor, which determines the scattering in-
tensities. They are in excellent agreement with the ex-
perimental data and reveal the mixing of in-plane and
out-of-plane phonon displacement directions inside the
Brillouin zone.
2H-MoS2 forms a hexagonal crystal with space group
P63/mmc (D4
6h in Sch¨onﬂieß notation) with six atoms in
the unit cell, giving rise to 18 phonon branches. At the Γ
point, the phonon modes decompose into the irreducible
representations
Γ2H = A1g⊕2A2u⊕2B2g⊕B1u⊕E1g⊕2E1u⊕2E2g⊕E2u
for the conventional deﬁnition of a 120◦angle between
the in-plane lattice vectors [27, 28]. If an angle of 60 ◦
between the in-plane lattice vectors is used, the irre-
ducible representation B2g is interchanged with B1g and
B1u with B2u. Due to the relatively weak non-covalent
coupling of the MoS2 layers, the phonon branches are
nearly doubly degenerate at almost all q-vectors in the
Brillouin zone and can be thought of as corresponding to
the 9 phonon branches of single-layer MoS2 (three atoms
per unit cell, space group P¯6m2, D3h).
In Fig. 1 a, a selection of the measured IXS spectra
is plotted. The displayed spectra were measured along
arXiv:1809.03381v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  10 Sep 20182
(0 0+q 12), with the absolute value of the phonon wave
vector |q| = q = 0 . . . 0.5 in units of the reciprocal lattice
vector. Here, (h k l) are the Miller indices identifying the
scattering vector of the elastically scattered light, i.e. a
Bragg peak. The extracted peak positions thus represent
the dispersion of the out-of-plane transverse modes from
Γ to M, see Fig. 1 b.
The IXS measurements allowed us to identify all acous-
tic and almost all optical phonon branches along the A-
Γ-K-M-Γ directions as shown in Fig. 2. IXS data are
shown by circles together with theoretical values from
DFT calculations (lines). Phonon energies obtained by
Raman spectroscopy of the same sample (stars in Fig. 2)
complement the IXS results with data at the Γ point. We
ﬁnd seemless agreement between the Γ-point frequencies
and the IXS data.
We observe nine phonon branches. The calculations
show that they are almost doubly degenerate, as expected
from the weak interlayer forces. The energy resolution in
the IXS experiment, however, does not allow to distin-
guish these so-called Davydov pairs: Each pair is formed
by two phonon modes, where the two layers forming the
bulk unit cell (i) have both the same displacement pat-
tern as the single layer and (ii) the displacement of one of
the layers is shifted in phase by π. At the Γ point, one of
the bulk modes of such a pair is always even with respect
to spatial inversion and the other one is odd [28, 29].
The frequency diﬀerence of the two phonons in a Davy-
dov pair is very small if the interaction between the layers
is weak. Only the acoustic phonons have fundamentally
diﬀerent behavior: one mode is still acoustic (zero fre-
quency), whereas the other one has ﬁnite frequency and
corresponds to a rigid-layer vibration at the Γ point.
Near the Γ point, the phonon modes have well de-
ﬁned displacement direction, i.e., in-plane longitudinal

(L), in-plane transverse (T), and out-of-plane transverse
(Z). This is seen by the color of the symbols representing
the IXS data, which indicates the displacement direction
preferentially detected in the given scattering geometry.
Towards the K and M points, we observe data points
with diﬀerent colors (i.e., diﬀerent preferred displacement
directions) on the same branch, see for instance the lon-
gitudinal acoustic (LA) branch. We interpret this by an
increased mixing of the displacement directions for in-
creasing q. This is supported by our calculations of the
phonon eigenvectors, see Fig. 3 for the example of the
transverse E1g branch, and Tab. SI-III in the supple-
mentary material for a compilation of all 18 eigenvectors
at the Γ, K, and M points.
Note that the mixing is
not limited to the in-plane direction, but includes the
out-of-plane modes as well, in contrast to the example
of graphite [31].
This mixing also explains why some
of the phonon branches are only partially observed or
show weak signal: for instance, the phonon branch with
E1g symmetry at the Γ point (in-plane vibration) can-
not be observed in the chosen scattering geometry (see
also discussion below). However, it gains an out-of-plane
component for q > 0, see Fig. 3, which results in (weak)
IXS signal.
Furthermore, we observe a quadratic dispersion of
the ZA branch (also called ﬂexural mode) near the Γ
point, which is typical for two-dimensional atomically
thin sheets [32] and underlines the 2D nature of the MoS2
layers even within the bulk crystal.
As in the case of
graphite and graphene [31, 33–35], the phonon disper-
sion of bulk MoS2 is thus expected to be indicative of
the phonon dispersion in monolayer MoS2 as well as in
related TMDCs.
The phonon dispersion obtained from DFT simula-
tions shows overall excellent agreement with the IXS
data.
As discussed in the following, the challenge for
lattice-dynamics simulations in layered materials is the
proper description of the eﬀect of non-covalent interac-
tions, which bind the individual layers together.
This
is particularly relevant for the rigid-layer, low-frequency
shear and breathing-like modes in the vicinity of the Γ-
point, where the force-constants are small and dominated
by contributions from the non-covalent interlayer cou-
pling.
Therefore, we implemented the contributions from the
popular DFT-D3 van-der-Waals corrections [36] to the
dynamical matrix [37] to the density functional per-
turbation theory code in the Quantum Espresso pack-
age [38]. These semi-empirical corrections introduce an
additional attractive London-like interatomic potential,
which compensates for the underbinding and intrinsic
exponential decay of non-classical interactions in the
GGA-PBE exchange-correlation approximation we used
for our computations. The obtained lattice constants of
a=3.158 ˚A and c=12.229 ˚A from our PBE+D3 calcula-
tions are close to the lattice constants of our MoS2 sam-3

phonons with an in-plane longitudinal (L) / in-plane transverse (T) / out-of-plane transverse (Z) component. For symbols
without an error bar, the error is estimated to be smaller than the symbol size. Open symbols depict peaks with small inten-
sities or larger error. Values at the Γ point are Raman and IR spectroscopy data from the literature [28–30] (diamonds) and
from Raman measurements on the same sample as used in the IXS experiment (stars). Phonon branches are labeled by their
symmetry within the D6h at the Γ point, as well as by their displacement (L, T, Z) and acoustic (A) or optical (O) character.

ple of aexp=3.161 ˚A and cexp=12.297 ˚A, suggesting an
excellent description of both covalent and non-covalent
interatomic bonding in MoS2.
The inclusion of non-covalent interactions leads to
a noticeable improvement for the values of the low-
frequency modes close to the Γ-point, which are signiﬁ-
cantly underestimated in the GGA-PBE approximation
(not shown). Our calculated phonon dispersion is in good
quantitative agreement with the IXS measurements for
the acoustic and low-energy optical modes (Tab. I) and
correctly describes the small ’bumps’ in the dispersion
of the Davydov pair of the LA-derived branch [E2g (LO,
shear mode) and E1u (LA) at the Γ point] along Γ-K-
M-Γ, see Fig. 2. For the higher-frequency modes, our
PBE+D3 approach appears to perform slightly less well
compared to the Raman measurements and systemati-
cally underestimates the frequencies of the Raman active
modes by a few cm−1, see Tab. I.
On the other hand, Molina-S´anchez et al. [25] have
shown that phonon dispersions from calculations using
the local-density approximation (LDA) oﬀer a reasonable
qualitative and quantitative description of the available
data from the previous INS experiments [23].
In gen-
eral, the predicted LDA frequencies are somewhat higher
than those from our PBE+D3 calculations, hence lead-
ing to a slightly better agreement between theory and ex-
periment for the high-energy optical modes, but a worse4

agreement for the acoustic and low-energy optical modes.
The good agreement seems consistent for a wide range
of layered crystals, but is to a certain extent fortuitous
due the intrinsic overbinding of LDA causing a harden-
ing of the predicted phonons at the cost of signiﬁcantly
lower-quality lattice constants. An improved quantita-
tive agreement over the full frequency range of MoS2
and similar layered materials hence requires an exchange-
correlation approximation that predicts stronger in-plane
covalent bonding than PBE and suﬃciently soft inter-
layer non-covalent interaction.
While we observed the phonon dispersion of eight of
the nine Davydov pairs in the experiment, we were un-
able to access the almost degenerate branches derived
from the two LO modes around 35 meV (E2u and E1g
at the Γ point) in the Γ-K and Γ-M directions in our
scattering geometries. In order to understand this, we
simulated the dynamical structure factor [39, 40] using
data from our DFT calculations. The simulations suggest
that destructive interference of the counter-phase oscil-
lation of the sulfur sublayers in each MoS2 layer cause
extinction of the structure factor for all q-vectors along
the Γ-M and Γ-K-M directions, if a Bragg peak (h k 0)
is used.
Using a Bragg peak (h k l) with a suitable out-of-plane
component l ̸= 0 should lead to activation of the LO
E1g and E2u branches, caused by symmetry breaking of
the phase factors from the atomic positions, which lifts
the destructive interference.
The intensity can be en-
hanced through a wise choice of the Bragg peak such that
it aligns the signs of the contributions from the atomic
displacements and of the phase factors from the atomic
positions.
This is illustrated in Fig. 4 a for simulated
measurements at the Bragg peak (-2 4 2) in the direction
(q 0 0). Further, our simulations correctly reproduce the
deactivation of the transverse E2u branch and activation
of the longitudinal E1g branch in the vicinity of the K
point that we observed in our IXS experiments near the
(0 0 12) peak, see Fig. 4 b.
This arises from a change
of atomic displacement patterns of the longitudinal E2u
and E1g modes from a pure in-plane to a pure out-of-
plane nature close to the K-point, such that these modes
behave similarly to the ZO modes. On the other hand,
the transverse E2u and E1g modes adopt a mixed out-
of-plane/in-plane nature in the middle of the Γ −K and
Γ−M lines (thus coupling to the (0 0 12) Bragg peak) but
revert back to a pure in-plane character in the vicinity of
the K point, see Tab. SII in the supplementary material.

ing (INS) [23] and details about our simulations of the
dynamical structure factor are given in the supplemen-
tary material.
In conclusion, the complete phonon dispersion rela-
tion of MoS2 is determined experimentally in the high-
symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone. In combina-
tion with DFT calculations, the data clearly show the 2D
character of the lattice vibrations in this layered crystal.
Therefore, the results can be immediately transferred to
the monolayer form of MoS2 and the vast family of re-
lated 2D materials, in particular isostructural TMDCs.
The understanding and engineering of scattering pro-
cesses involving phonons, such as in electron transport
or optical transitions involving the indirect band gap or
the two K valleys, will in future be based on the knowl-
edge of the phonon dispersion relation.

Methods
Inelastic X-ray spectra were recorded at beamline
35XU at the SPring-8 (Japan).
The measurements
were performed with a photon energy of 17.7935 keV
and a spectral width of ≲3 meV (full width of half
maximum, FWHM). The momentum resolution was set
to 0.75 nm−1.
The focused beam had a spot size of
75 × 63 µm2, enabling us to select a single crystalline
domain of our bulk MoS2 crystal. A detailed description
of the beamline can be found in Ref. [42].
The sample is a synthesized crystal (HQ graphene,
Netherlands) with a thickness of about 150 µm to match
the attenuation length of the used X-rays in MoS2, yield-
ing the best trade-oﬀbetween high absorption and low
scattering in a transmission setup.
All measurements
were taken at ambient conditions.
The phonon calculations were performed using den-
sity functional perturbation theory (DFPT) module of
Quantum Espresso [38], a 12x12x4 k-point sampling and
normconserving pseudopotentials [43, 44] with a cutoﬀ
energy of 120 Ry. Long-range non-covalent interactions
in both groundstate and phonon calculations were in-
cluded through the semi-empirical DFT-D3 correction
with Becke-Johnson damping [36] that we added on top of
the PBE exchange-correlation. We used a set of parame-
ters for the D3 corrections that was ﬁtted to successfully
reproduce the experimental lattice constants of a wide va-
riety of layered and bulk materials [21, 45, 46]. A more
detailed description of the experimental and theoretical
methods can be found in the supplementary material.
