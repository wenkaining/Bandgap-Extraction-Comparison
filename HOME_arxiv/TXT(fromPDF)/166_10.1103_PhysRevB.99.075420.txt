Abstract
A diﬀraction problem for a ﬂat Chern-Simons layer at plane boundary of a di-
electric half space is solved. The Casimir energy of two dielectric half spaces with
Chern-Simons layers at plane-parallel boundaries separated by a vacuum slit is de-
rived. Crossing from the repulsive to the attractive Casimir force is analyzed for two
Au and two Si half spaces with boundary Chern-Simons layers. Boundary quantum
Hall layers in external magnetic ﬁeld lead to Casimir repulsion at nanoscales. We
discuss features that make systems with boundary quantum Hall layers unique for
force measurements and search of long-range interactions beyond electromagnetism.

Introduction
The Casimir eﬀect [1] is a quantum interaction eﬀect between macroscopic objects [2] - [14].
Chern-Simons terms [15] were intensively studied in quantum ﬁeld theory [16] - [19]. The
Casimir interaction of two ﬂat Chern-Simons layers in vacuum was considered in [20, 21].
The Casimir-Polder potential of a neutral anisotropic atom in the presence of a ﬂat Chern-
Simons layer was found in [22], charge-parity violating eﬀects due to Chern-Simons layer
interacting with an atom were considered in [23].
The force between two Chern-Simons layers in vacuum is either attractive or repulsive
at all distances depending on values of constants deﬁning Chern-Simons layers [20, 21].
The situation changes if there are Chern-Simons layers at plane-parallel boundaries of
dielectric half spaces separated by a vacuum slit of the width L, this problem is considered
in the present paper. For coinciding Chern-Simons layers at plane-parallel boundaries we
demonstrate there can be a minimum of the Casimir energy and, as a result, Casimir
repulsion at nanoscales.
It is natural to perform the Casimir force measurements with quantum Hall layers
as Chern-Simons boundary layers. Suppose one puts the system in a constant external
magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the layers. The constant a of the Chern-Simons action is
uniquely deﬁned by the plateau of the quantum Hall eﬀect in terms of QED ﬁne structure
∗email: maraval@mail.ru
1coupling α and an integer or a fractional number n characterizing this plateau as a = αn
[24]. The plateau of the quantum Hall eﬀect is deﬁned by the magnitude of an external
magnetic ﬁeld. Without external electric ﬁeld parallel to the quantum Hall layer there are
no spatial components of the Hall current in the boundary layer, it is reasonable to perform
Casimir force measurements in this regime.
The Casimir force between two half spaces with Chern-Simons boundary layers can
be evaluated from the ﬁrst principles and with high precision: constants of Chern-Simons
layers are deﬁned by the plateaus of the quantum Hall eﬀect, frequency dependent di-
electric permittivities of the underlying semispaces can be extracted from the tabulated
optical data [25].
The total force in the Casimir experiments typically consists of two
parts: the Casimir and the electrostatic contributions [26, 27]. The diﬀerence in the the-
oretical and experimental determination of the force may be a signal of long-range forces
beyond electromagnetism measured in experiment. Long-range interactions beyond elec-
tromagnetism arise due to exchange of light scalar particles predicted in many extensions
of the Standard Model leading to Yukawa-type potentials [28], Yukawa-type potentials in
the extra-dimensional theories with a low-energy compactiﬁcation scale [29, 30], power-
type potentials [31, 32], axion exchange potential [33]. In the interaction range above a
few micrometers the strongest constraints on potentials of long-range interactions follow
from Cavendish type experiments [34, 35, 36, 37], at shorter separations the strongest con-
straints on Yukawa-type potentials and axion-to-nucleon coupling constants were obtained
from various Casimir eﬀect experiments [12, 26, 27, 38].
To sum up, there are several features that make systems with quantum Hall surface lay-
ers unique for force measurements: stabilization of force measurements at short separations
due to Casimir repulsion, quick decrease of the Casimir force in system with Chern-Simons
layers in comparison to the Lifshitz force for two dielectric half spaces [3] at separations
approaching the minimum of the Casimir energy, precise evaluation of the Casimir force
from the ﬁrst principles of quantum ﬁeld theory, possibility of changing plateaus in the
quantum Hall eﬀect regime by external magnetic ﬁeld resulting in a change of the force at
a given separation. Geometry of two half spaces with plane-parallel boundaries separated
by a vacuum slit L is the simplest geometry where novel features due to Chern-Simons
boundary layers occur.
We proceed as follows. In Sec.2 we solve a diﬀraction problem for Chern-Simons layer
at the boundary of dielectric half space characterized by a permittivity ε(ω), reﬂection
and transmission coeﬃcients for diﬀraction of an electromagnetic plane wave are derived.
In Sec.3 we apply scattering formalism [11], [39] - [45] to derive formulas for the Casimir
energy of two dielectric half spaces with Chern-Simons layers at plane-parallel boundaries
separated by a vacuum slit L. We study Casimir forces for Au and Si half spaces with
Chern-Simons boundary layers, crossing from the repulsive to the attractive Casimir force
is analyzed.
We use units ℏ= c = 1.

with the current Jν = aεzνρσFρσ and vector-potential Aν. Equations of electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the presence of Chern-Simons action (1) can be written as follows:

Consider a ﬂat Chern-Simons layer put at z = 0 on a dielectric half space z < 0 char-
acterized by a frequency dependent dielectric permittivity ε(ω), the magnetic permeability

Casimir interaction
Consider two half spaces (z ≤0 and z ≥L) characterized in their volume by a frequency
dependent permittivity ε(ω). Chern-Simons terms with constants a1, a2 are located at
plane-parallel boundaries z = 0 and z = L of dielectric half spaces. There is a vacuum slit
0 < z < L between two half spaces.
The reﬂection matrix Rdown(a1) = R(a1) from the z ≤0 half space is deﬁned by:

Consider the system consisting of two dielectric half spaces with Chern-Simons layers

Consider two Au half spaces separated by a vacuum slit with Chern-Simons boundary
layers satisfying the condition a ≡a1 = a2. At large separations the Casimir force is
attractive. At short separations there exists a range of parameters a and distances with
a repulsive Casimir force. It is instructive to plot the position of the energy minimum
separating regions of the repulsive and the attractive force for three diﬀerent models of di-
electric permittivity: a Drude model ε(ω) = 1−ω2
p/ω(ω+iγ) with ωp = 9 eV, γ = 0.035 eV ,
six-oscillator Drude model [47] and Drude model with full set of Au data [25] taken into
account through Kramers-Kronig relations to evaluate ε(iω). On Fig.1 dependence of the
position of the energy minimum L0 on the parameter a is shown. The force changes its
sign at separations L0 ∼5 nm. These distances are typical for the nonretarded region of
the Casimir interaction between two dielectric/metal half spaces separated by a vacuum
slit. To evaluate the Casimir force in the nonretarded limit one should use optical data
for frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity on the whole frequency axis. This is
the reason why the simple Drude model of Au and even the six-oscillator model of Au can
not be used for precise calculations of the Casimir forces at these separations. Energy plot
corresponding to Chern-Simons parameters a1 = a2 = 0.565 (corresponding to a maximum
5value L0 = 3.65 nm on Fig.1) is shown on Fig.2. The change of the force from repulsive to
attractive behavior takes place at the distance L0 = 3.65 nm in this case.
For dielectric permittivity of intrinsic Si we used the model [48]. The change of the
force sign for Si corresponding to a1 = a2 = 0.567 takes place at the distance L0 = 6.39
nm (Fig.3, Fig.4), which is about 2 times larger than in the case of Au.
It is also instructive to plot ratio of the Casimir force with Chern-Simons layers at the
boundaries of two half spaces F to the Lifshitz force Fs [3] (the force between two dielectric
half spaces separated by a distance L). These ratios for Au and Si are shown on Fig.5 and
Fig.6 respectively; transition between repulsive and attractive regimes of the Casimir force
due to Chern-Simons boundary layers is clearly seen. Note that ratio of the forces quickly
decreases at L0 < L ≲20 nm for Au and L0 < L ≲30 nm for Si systems.
Casimir repulsion at short separations is explained as follows. Lifshitz force power law
eﬀectively changes from attractive retarded L−4 to attractive nonretarded L−3 behaviour
for dielectrics (metals) at distances of the order L ∼10 nm. On the other hand, the force
between two Chern-Simons layers in vacuum has L−4 behavior at all separations and thus
dominates the total force at separations of the order L ≲10 nm. For an interval a ∈[0, a0],
where a0 ≈1.032502, and the condition a ≡a1 = a2 the Casimir force between two Chern-
Simons layers in vacuum is always repulsive. As a result, the sum of the Lifshitz force and
the force between two Chern-Simons layers in vacuum eﬀectively leads to Casimir repulsion
at short separations.
Chern-Simons constants of the layers at z = 0 and z = L will be equal (a ≡a1 = a2) in a
constant external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the layers if one uses quantum Hall layers
at the boundaries of dielectric half spaces. Quantum Hall layers are eﬀectively described by
Chern-Simons terms at plateaus of the quantum Hall eﬀect with Chern-Simons constants
a = αn, where α is QED ﬁne structure constant, n is an integer or a fractional number
corresponding to integer or fractional quantum Hall eﬀect. It is reasonable to put external
electric ﬁeld parallel to the layers equal to zero to avoid spatial components of Hall currents
in the boundary layers. Quantum Hall layers will lead to Casimir repulsion at nanoscales
for a ≲1 for Au and Si. Essential decrease of the Casimir force due to presence of boundary
quantum Hall layers in comparison with Lifshitz force should be seen at separations L ≲20
nm for Au and L ≲30 nm for Si half spaces.
For a1 = −a2 the force is always attractive, ratios of the Casimir force with Chern-
Simons layers at the boundaries of two half spaces F to the Lifshitz force Fs are plotted
on Fig.7 and Fig.8 for Au and Si respectively. The attractive Casimir force in this case
is due to a theorem that opposites obtained by mirror images of each other attract when
they are separated by a vacuum slit [49].

Conclusions
In this paper we present a solution of a diﬀraction problem for a Chern-Simons plane layer
located at the boundary of a dielectric half space characterized by a frequency dependent
dielectric permittivity ε(ω). Casimir forces for two dielectric half spaces with Chern-Simons
boundary layers separated by a vacuum slit L have remarkable properties. For equal Chern-
Simons terms the Casimir energy has a minimum at L = L0 for an interval of constants a
of Chern-Simons terms, the Casimir force for such systems is repulsive at short separations
6and attractive at large separations. We have shown that for Au half spaces with Chern-
Simons boundary layers the minimum of the Casimir energy can be achieved at separation
L0 = 3.65 nm, for Si half spaces with Chern-Simons boundary layers - at L0 = 6.39 nm.
Repulsive behaviour of the Casimir force at short separations should enhance stability of
force measurements at L ∼L0. Quick decrease of the Casimir force in comparison to the
Lifshitz force at separations approaching the energy minimum is another interesting feature
of systems with Chern-Simons boundary layers that can be veriﬁed in experiments.
It is natural to consider experimental implementation of the Chern-Simons layers as
quantum Hall layers in the presence of constant external magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to
the layers and zero external electric ﬁeld parallel to the layers. Knowledge of the Chern-
Simons constant a = αn at each plateau of the quantum Hall eﬀect (characterized by an
integer or a fractional number n) is important for precise evaluation of the Casimir force
from the ﬁrst principles.
Finding the diﬀerence between the theoretical force and its experimental values is a
natural way to search for long-range interactions beyond electromagnetism. Systems with
Chern-Simons boundary layers have unique features that provide novel possibilities in ex-
perimental search of long-range interactions beyond electromagnetism via force measure-
ments.
