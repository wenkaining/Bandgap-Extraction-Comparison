Abstract
One-dimensional quasilattices, namely, the geometrical objects to represent
quasicrystals, are classiﬁed into mutual local-derivability (MLD) classes. Be-
sides the familiar class, there exist an inﬁnite number of new MLD classes,
and diﬀerent MLD classes are distinguished by the inﬂation rules of their
representatives. It has been found that electronic properties of a new MLD
class are characterized by the presence of marginal critical states, which are
considered to be nearly localized states.

1Quasicrystals (QCs) have aperiodic ordered structures, which are diﬀerent from either
of crystalline and disordered materials. It has been reported that QCs exhibit quite unique
physical properties [1], which should be closely connected with the structure of QCs. A
suﬃcient understanding in this respect is, however, yet to be attained. For instance, in
order to understand the transport properties of QCs, further systematic studies on the
electronic properties of various types of QCs are necessary.
The atomic positions of an idealized QC form a quasiperiodic object called quasilattice
(QL), the classiﬁcation of which is the principal subject of the crystallography of QCs. One
of the important features of QLs is the self-similarity, which is closely connected with the
physical properties. Thus, in the ﬁrst part of this letter, we shall develop a new classiﬁcation
scheme of QLs based on the self-similarity. One can argue that the diﬀerent classes of QLs
correspond to diﬀerent universality classes with respect to the electronic properties. We next
show that there exists a new class of QLs whose electronic properties are characterized by
the presence of marginal critical states, which can be thought of as being virtually localized.
This feature is essentially diﬀerent from the case of the standard class of QLs on which most
of the previous studies have been done. The transport properties of the new class may be
markedly diﬀerent from the conventional one.
We conﬁne ourselves to one-dimensional (1D) cases. A 1D QL is obtained by projecting
a subset of a 2D lattice Λ, the mother lattice, onto a 1D subspace E∥[2,3]. The line E∥is
taken to be parallel to τa1 + a2 with a1 and a2 being the primitive lattice vectors of Λ and
τ a quadratic irrational such as 1
2(1 +
√
5) (the golden mean), 1 +
√
2 (the silver mean),
etc. The subset is taken as Λ ∩Σ with Σ being a parallel strip to E∥. If the scales of E∥
and E⊥, the physical space and its orthogonal complement, are chosen appropriately, both
the projections Λ∥and Λ⊥of Λ onto E∥and E⊥, respectively, are given by the dense set
Z[τ] ≡{p + qτ | p, q ∈Z}. Thus, a 1D QL is a discrete subset of Λ∥, where its point density
is proportional to the window W, i.e., the width of the strip Σ. According to the relative
position of Σ to Λ, an inﬁnite number of QLs are possible with the same W. But they form a
single local-isomorphism class, and their diﬀerences are irrelevant to the physical properties.
For a generic W, one obtains a ternary 1D QL composed of three types of lattice spacings,
s, m and l, referring to short, medium and long spacings, respectively; they satisfy |l| =
|s| + |m|. If W is reduced, one obtains another QL as a subset of the original QL. The new
spacings, s′, m′ and l′, are composites of the older ones. For an appropriate choice of the
reduction of W, the older QL turns out to be a uniform decoration of the newer, i.e., the
decoration of l′, for example, is common for all l′s. The three decorations of the spacings
form a substitution rule. The newer QL is then called a subquasilattice (SQL) of the older.
If W is reduced by the factor τ −n with n being any positive integer, the resulting QL
is locally isomorphic with the scaled version of the original QL with the factor τ n [4].
The original QL is called self-similar if the new QL is an SQL of the original. Here, the
substitution rule, combining the three spacings of the original QL with the newer ones,
represents the self-similarity; it is called the inﬂation rule. It can be shown that a QL can
be self-similar if and only if its window W belongs to the quadratic ﬁeld Q[τ] ≡{r+sτ | r, s ∈
Q} [5]; that is, the window must be rational. The inﬂation rule as well as the minimum
power n for the ratio of self-similarity, τ n, depends on a number theoretical property of W.
The following argument will be focused on this rational case.
Several QLs associated with the silver mean are presented in Table I. The ﬁrst two are
2binary but others ternary. The QLs except for “C” and “E” have self-similarities whose
ratios are presented in the 6th column. The QL “C” is not self-similar but is changed to the
once-inﬂated version of “A” by the substitution rule in the 7th column. A similar relation
holds between the pair {D, E}. The QL “A” is an SQL of “B” with the substitution rule,
s′ = s, l′ = sm, and the QL “F” is an SQL of “G” with s′ = m, m′ = l, l′ = msm. Though
the two QLs “G” and “H” are similar, there exists no inﬂation rule which combine them.
We introduce an important relationship between QLs: two QLs are mutually locally-
derivable if all the sites of one of them are determined locally from the structure of the other
and vice versa [6]. All the QLs derived from a single mother lattice are classiﬁed into an
inﬁnite number of mutual local-derivability (MLD) classes. The MLD class to which a given
QL belongs is determined by a number theoretical property of W ∈Q[τ]. We only present a
necessary condition: if two QLs belong to a single MLD class, the relevant two windows have
a common denominator when they are represented as simple fractions in the quadratic ﬁeld.
A QL and its any SQL belong to the same MLD class. The eight QLs in Table I are divided
into three MLD classes: {A, B, C}, {D, E}, {F, G, H}. It can be shown that i) every MLD
class includes at least one self-similar member, which can be taken as a representative of the
class, and ii) every QL in the MLD class has an SQL which is similar to the representative;
that is, any non-self-similar QL is a uniform decoration of a self-similar QL.
The structure factor of a QL is composed of Bragg peaks, whose intensities are determined
by the size of the window.
For example, the three QLs, “C”, “D” and “F” in Table I,
have windows of similar sizes, and their structure factors are not so much diﬀerent. They
nevertheless belong to diﬀerent MLD classes.
We shall call a QL to be type I or II according as its window belongs to Z[τ] or not,
respectively. All the type I QLs for a given τ form a single MLD class, as seen in Table I.
Previous investigations on the electronic properties of 1D QLs have been almost exclusively
done on the basis of models on type I QLs [7–9]. It has been proved that a type I QL and its
any decoration belong to a common universality class of electronic properties [10], which are
dominated by the structures of the inﬂation rule. On the other hand, we may expect that
type II QLs belong to diﬀerent universality classes, because their inﬂation rules are diﬀerent
from that of the type I class.
We now present a brief review on the electronic properties of type I QLs. The main
observations, obtained from the case of the Fibonacci lattice as well as some of its associates,
are [7]: i) the energy spectrum is purely singular-continuous or, equivalently, fractal-like,
and ii) all the eigenfunctions are critical, i.e., neither extended nor localized in the usual
meaning. The energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions have also been found to exhibit self-
similar structures, which can be directly related to the inﬂation rule of the underlying QL
by a real-space renormalization-group approach [8].
The energy spectrum of any homogeneous 1D system obeys locally a scaling law. The
local scaling at the reference energy Er is represented by the scaling exponent α = α(Er)
satisfying 0 ≤α ≤1 [7]. While α represents the local dimension of the energy spectrum,
it also characterizes the localization character of the eigenfunction of the energy level Er.
In particular, an isolated energy level of a localized state has a vanishing exponent, α = 0,
while inside an absolutely continuous spectrum, which conﬁrms extended states, α = 1. A
purely singular-continuous spectrum being characterized by fractional exponents conﬁrms
critical eigenfunctions. The energy spectrum of a type I QL is, in general, a multifractal
3[11], and is characterized by the f(α) spectrum. The support of the f(α) is an interval
[αmin, αmax] with 0 < αmin < αmax < 1; α ranges from αmin to αmax, so that every energy
level is characterized by fractional power-law scaling [7].
Although the above observations are common in the case of type I QLs, electronic proper-
ties of type II QLs have been scarcely investigated. In the following, we show some numerical
as well as analytical evidence that the type II QL listed as “D” in Table I and shown in
Fig. 1 indeed exhibits a new scaling property. Let us take a binary atomic chain, which
is obtained by decorating this QL as follows: i) atoms of type X are located on all the
lattice points, ii) one atom of type Y is located on each spacing of type m, and iii) a pair
of type Y atoms is located on each spacing of type l. The densities of the two types of
atoms in the chain are equal. More remarkably, the chain is invariant against the exchange
of two types of atoms, X and Y. We employ the tight-binding model on this atomic chain,
tΨj−1 + VjΨj + tΨj+1 = EΨj, where we assume that t = −1 for the transfer integrals and
VX = 0 and VY = V for the relevant site energies.
Due to the aforementioned symmetry of the atomic chain, the energy spectrum becomes
symmetrical which is conﬁrmed by the numerical result as shown in Fig. 2. The energy
spectrum is divided into two equivalent clusters, and the left cluster exhibits a hierarchical
trifurcation, which will reﬂect the nature of the leftmost level, i.e., the ground state. The
trifurcation can be understood in terms of a perturbational real-space renormalization-group
approach similar to that introduced by Niu and Nori for the case of the Fibonacci lattice
[8]. The approach is based on the recursive structure of the QL and assumes V ≫1. In
the zeroth approximation, the spectrum consists of two equally degenerate energy levels at
E = 0 and V , while the eigenstates are the Wannier states themselves. To see the splitting
of the level originating from X atoms, all the Y atoms are decimated as shown in Fig. 3.
This yields three types of eﬀective transfer integrals between X atoms, ts = −1, tm ≈−1/V ,
and tl ≈−1/V 2, which are all negative and satisfy the inequalities:
|ts| ≫|tm| ≫|tl|.
(1)
In the ﬁrst approximation, we take only the leading eﬀective transfer integral ts into
account. Since the type s spacings are isolated, the energy spectrum consists of three sub-
levels at E = 0 and E = ±ts (= ∓1); the central level is derived from isolated atoms,
while the two satellites from isolated diatomic “molecules”. The weights of the three sub-
levels have the ratios τ −1 : τ −2 : τ −1, which agree with the numerical results. To see the
trifurcation of the level derived from the molecular bonding states, we shall consider the
“molecules” to be the “atoms” of the second generation. Due to the self-similarity of the
QL, there appear three types of eﬀective transfer integrals between the new “atoms” as
shown in Fig. 3:
t′
s ≈1
2tm, t′
m ≈1
2tl, and t′
l ≈1
2
t2
l
ts
,
(2)
where the numerical factor 1/2 appears as the square of the bonding amplitude 1/
√
2. Since
the new parameters satisfy the same inequalities as Eq. (1), we can return now to the
point after Eq. (1) and continue the discussion recursively. Thus, we obtain a hierarchical
trifurcation spectrum. The ground state is understood to be a hierarchical composite of
molecular bonding states, as shown in Fig. 4.
4To make a quantitative argument, we introduce two positive parameters as the ratios
between the eﬀective transfer integrals of the nth generation:
fn = t(n)
m
t(n)
s
,
gn = t(n)
l
t(n)
m
.
(3)
Eq. (2) yields the two-dimensional map, fn+1 ≈gn,
gn+1 ≈fngn, which converges to
the origin of the fg-plane. This means that the “atoms” are increasingly isolated as n is
increased. We can linearize this 2D map with new variables, ln fn and ln gn, and obtain the
asymptotic expression
fn ≈gn−1 ∼exp [−cτ n
G] = exp [−cτ nν],
(4)
with τG = (1+
√
5)/2, i.e., the golden mean, and ν = ln τG/ ln τ ≈0.546. Note that τG is the
leading eigenvalue of the 2 × 2 matrix associated with the linearized map and c a positive
constant depending on V .
The band width wn of the subcluster of the nth generation is estimated to be wn ≈2|t(n)
s |.
The relation t(n+1)
s
≈1
2t(n)
m as in Eq. (2) can be used to prove wn+1/wn ≈t(n+1)
s
/t(n)
s
≈1
2fn ∼
exp [−cτ nν], which tends to zero as n →∞. This is observed in Fig. 2. Then, it can be
proved that wn ∼exp [−c′τ nν] with c′ being another positive constant. Since the size L of
the “atom” of the nth generation is proportional to τ n, we ﬁnd wn ∼exp [−(L/ξ)ν], i.e., a
stretched exponential, with ξ being a characteristic length. This is manifestly diﬀerent from
the case of usual critical states exhibiting a power-law, wn ∼L−1/α, and has never been
observed in energy spectra of type I QLs. Note that a power-law scaling could be observed
if the ratio wn+1/wn had tended to a ﬁnite value.
The above argument proves that the exponent α of the ground state vanishes. This does
not mean, however, that the ground state is localized, because the ground state level is not
isolated from other levels. The length ξ, which decreases as V is increased and diverges
as V →0, represents the size of almost isolated “atoms”. The presence of a characteristic
length implies that the ground state wave function, shown in Fig. 4, is not self-similar,
although it still remains critical. We may call the ground state a marginal critical state,
presence of which is closely connected with the self-similarity of the present QL.
The exact real-space renormalization-group formalism proposed by Ashraﬀand Stinch-
combe [9] can also be adapted to study the ground state properties. There appears a 7D map
but its asymptotic behavior is dominated by its behavior in a 2D subspace corresponding
to the fg-plane. The map being reduced to the subspace is essentially the same as above.
It has also been numerically conﬁrmed that each energy level at a band edge, where energy
levels only accumulate from one side, gives the equivalent ﬁxed point of the 7D map to that
of the the ground state level.
The presence of marginal critical states causes vanishing of the left end αmin of the sup-
port [αmin, αmax] of the relevant f(α) spectrum. This is an important feature of electronic
properties of type II QLs, and has also been conﬁrmed for several other type II QLs in-
cluding the one whose ratio of self-similarity is τ 3
G. The exponent ν introduced above is a
proper number to the relevant MLD class but satisﬁes 0 < ν < 1. It is surprising that QLs
derived from a single mother lattice can belong to diﬀerent universality classes of electronic
properties.
5The binary sequence of atoms in the atomic chain used to investigate electronic properties
of type II QLs is found to be one of the circle sequences investigated in detail by Aubry et
al [12]. Some of other type II QLs can also be transformed to circle sequences if they are
decorated appropriately, but a general relationship between the type II QLs and the circle
sequences awaits a further investigation. We should remark, however, that an indication of
an unusual electronic property of a circle sequence was ﬁrst reported by Luck [13].
The present report is summarized as follows: i) 1D QLs can be classiﬁed into an inﬁnite
number of MLD classes, which are distinguished from each other by the inﬂation rules of
their representatives, and ii) there exists a “type II” MLD class whose electronic properties
are characterized by the presence of marginal critical states.
A full account of the exact real-space renormalization-group treatment of marginal crit-
ical states will be presented elsewhere. The present results can also be extended to 2D and
3D QLs because these QLs are related to 1D QLs through the Ammann bars or planes [3],
and the results will be reported elsewhere.
