We present the exact spectral function for a single oxygen hole with spin opposite to ferromagnetic
order within a one-dimensional CuO3-like spin chain. We ﬁnd that local Kondo-like exchange
interaction generates ﬁve diﬀerent states in the strong coupling regime. It stabilizes a spin polaron
which is a bound state of a moving charge dressed by magnon excitations, with essentially the same
dispersion as predicted by mean ﬁeld theory. We then examine in detail the evolution of the spectral
function for increasing strength of the hole-magnon interaction. We also demonstrate that the s and
p symmetry of orbital states in the conduction band are essentially equivalent to each other and ﬁnd
that the simpliﬁed models do not suﬃce to reproduce subtle aspects of hole-magnon coupling in the
charge-transfer model.

INTRODUCTION
The theoretical analysis of transition metal oxides, in-
cluding cuprates, manganites and iron pnictides, requires
faithful description of strongly correlated electrons which
localize due to Coulomb interactions in partly ﬁlled 3d
orbitals.1 These interactions lead to Mott insulators in
undoped compounds, with spin and orbital degrees of
freedom which interact with charge defects arising un-
der doping2 — then the magnetic order and transport
properties change due to subtle interplay between charge
and magnetic/orbital degrees of freedom. Good examples
are high temperature superconductivity in cuprates,3–5
or colossal magnetoresistance in manganites.6–8 In these
systems, the interaction between charge carriers and local-
ized spins is of crucial importance and drives the observed
evolution of magnetic order and transport properties, cap-
tured in double exchange mechanism.9–12 These changes
may also depend on subtle quantum eﬀects in systems
with coupled spin-orbital-charge degrees of freedom.13
A well known problem is the dynamics of one hole
added to oxygen orbitals which interacts with S = 1/2
spins at Cu ions in CuO2 planes of high temperature su-
perconductors. The spins form an antiferromagnetic (AF)
order due to the superexchange interaction. A complete
treatment of this problem involes a three-band model,14
with Cu x2 −y2 orbitals occupied by one hole each and O
2p orbitals along the bonds. Instead, theoretical studies
focus frequently on simpliﬁed treatments which do not
include all quantum eﬀects related to charge carries inter-
acting with spin excitations in phases with magnetic order.
For example, following the idea of Zhang and Rice,15 a
simpliﬁed single-band model has been derived for CuO2
planes from the charge-transfer model,16 and next used
to study the evolution of magnetic order with increasing
hole doping. However, such eﬀective models do not ac-
curately describe the electronic states in lightly doped
materials. For instance, even low doping of less than 5%
charge carriers is suﬃcient to change the magnetic order
in vanadates17 or in manganites.18
Electronic states change radically when electrons or
holes propagate in a background with magnetic order.
The well known example is a single hole which is clas-
sically conﬁned in an antiferromagnet,19 but develops a
quasiparticle propagating on the scale of superexchange
by its coupling to quantum spin ﬂuctuations.20 In con-
trast, a conduction electron in the ferromagnetic (FM)
background propagates as a free particle, as known in FM
semiconductors such as EuO or EuS.21 Here the electron
spin oriented in the opposite way to the FM background
scatters on magnon excitations which leads to rather
complex many-body problem,22 and to changes of the
electronic structure with increasing temperature.23 It was
pointed out24 that a repeated emission and reabsorption
of a magnon by the conduction electron results in an
eﬀective attraction between magnon and electron. This
gives rise to a polaron-like quasiparticle, the magnetic
polaron. Another excitation is due to a direct magnon
emission or absorption by the electron, thereby ﬂipping
its own spin, leading to scattering states. Modiﬁcations of
electronic structure due to polarons were also discussed
in manganites,25 cobaltates,26 and vanadates.27
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the formation
of polaron-like features and scattering states in a tight-
binding model motivated by the physical properties known
from cuprates. Due to strong local Coulomb repulsion U
at x2 −y2 orbitals of Cu ions, the model including holes
in these orbitals and in the surrounding oxygen orbitals,
called also a three-band model, reduces to a spin-fermion
model.28,29 The latter describes an oxygen hole coupled
to the neighboring spins by a Kondo-like antiferromag-
netic (AF) exchange interaction. This local AF coupling
frustrates the AF superexchange in CuO2 planes and is
responsible for a rapid decay of AF order under increasing
doping. The main diﬃculty in treating the dynamics of a
doped hole are the AF quantum ﬂuctuations of the spin
background, which have to be treated in an approximate
way.3–5

Only very few many-body problems are exactly solvable.
Exact solutions are typically limited to one-dimensional
(1D) models or to a very special choice of interaction pa-
rameters. However, an exact solution (i) provides always
important physical insights into the nature of quantum
states involved, (ii) could serve to test approximate treat-
ments, and (iii) may be used to draw useful conclusions for
experimental studies. Recently, it was pointed out that
a hole in a FM system with a single magnon excitation
provides valuable insights into the spectral properties of
a doped hole moving in a spin polarized system.30 Here
we introduce a CuO3-like spin-chain model, as studied for
YBa2Cu3O7 high temperature superconductors. Recently,
excited states were investigated in AF CuO3 chains31 in
Sr2CuO3 and an interesting interplay due to spin-orbital
entanglement13 was pointed out.32 Here we analyze ex-
actly the spectral properties in a FM chain. As we show
below, they include the polaron-like and scattering states
when the moving carrier interacts with magnons.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we intro-
duce a 1D model for a CuO3 spin chain. The spectral
function of a single charge added to the oxygen orbital
with the spin opposite to the FM order is obtained ex-
actly using the Green’s function method in Sec. III A. In
Sec. III B we present an approximate perturbative solu-
tion for the same problem of a charge carrier coupled to
the FM background in the strong coupling regime, while
the mean ﬁeld solution is given in Sec. III C. The numeri-
cal results are presented in Sec. IV and the exact results
are compared with the approximate ones. Summary and
conclusions are given in Sec. V, while certain details of
the derivation outlined in Sec. III A are presented in the
Appendix.
II.
THE MODEL
We consider a 1D model presented in Fig. 1, with the
same structure as a CuO3 1D chain in YBa2Cu3O7, and
assume that spins with a general value S occupy the
transition metal sites. In case of copper oxides, holes
localize at Cu ions and S = 1/2. Spins {Si} are coupled
here by FM Heisenberg exchange interactions as in the
case of simpler 1D models considered before,30 while holes
in oxygen orbitals represent charge degrees of freedom
which couple to spins by a local AF exchange, similar to
a hole added to a CuO2 plane.28 We label the oxygen
orbitals as follows: (i) ai±ξ is located in between the
magnetic sites, where ξ is a vector pointing from the
Cu site towards the a site on its right, and (ii) bi±ζ is
located above and below the magnetic sites, where ζ is
a vector pointing from the Cu site towards the b site
above it. Taking the charge-transfer model for a charged
Cu2+O2−
3
chain as a reference (physical vacuum) state,
these orbitals are ﬁlled with electrons and contain no hole.

H = T + HS + HK,

includes the kinetic (hopping) part T , the FM exchange
between localized spins, HS, as well as Kondo-like AF
exchange interactions between a charge carrier (hole) in
diﬀerent orbitals and neighboring localized spins, HK.
The hopping couples the a and b orbitals, see Fig. 1.
Depending on the orbital symmetry, only one of the local
combinations of b orbitals contributes to T and HS, so it is
convenient to introduce their symmetric (+, for s orbitals)
or antisymmetric (−, for p orbitals) combinations, b±

where Si is a spin operator for the magnetic ion at site
i, sm is a spin operator for the respective oxygen hole
in orbital m = a, b, and S is the magnitude of a single
localized spin on the magnetic sublattice. All the energy
constants are positive (t > 0, J0 > 0, J > 0) and therefore
HS provides FM coupling between the localized spins,
while HK describes an AF Kondo-like coupling between
localized spins and conduction electrons.28
We study below the dynamics of a single hole injected
into either of the conduction bands, which arise after T
is diagonalized — one considers then two orbitals per
unit cell and the Cu-Cu distance a = 1. We will use the
fermion representation for spin operators in the conduc-
tion band, sm. By transforming all the fermion operators
to the reciprocal space by means of discrete Fourier trans-
formation one arrives at the following representation of
the Hamiltonian,

are just a shorthand notation for the respective fermionic

operators. However, their eﬀect in the spin subspace is
similar.
As for HS, its following eigenstates are easily identiﬁed:

where |FM⟩is the physical vacuum state, and S−
q |FM⟩,
deﬁned by Eq. (5), is a magnetic excited state with one
magnon (spin wave) created in the FM background and
its energy dispersion
Ωq = 4JS sin2(q/2).
(9)
Since the Hamiltonian under consideration conserves the
total spin, these magnon states are the only attainable in
the problem of a single hole with spin s = 1/2 coupled to
the FM spin background.

SPIN POLARON AND SCATTERING
STATES
A.
Exact solution by Green’s functions
To obtain the hole spectral function we calculate ﬁrst
the Green’s function, deﬁned by the expectation value of
the resolvent,
G(ω) = [ω −H + iη]−1,
(10)
for the ↓-spin states of an added hole. Therefore, the
Green’s function has a 2 × 2 matrix structure:
Gµν(k, ω) = ⟨FM|µk↓G(ω)ν†
k↓|FM⟩,
(11)
where µ, ν are again indices going over the states {a, b}.
Following a method similar to the one described by Berciu
and Sawatzky,33 we divide the Hamiltonian, H0 = T +HS,
into the free part corresponding to G0, and the term
V = HK which couples the two subsystems by the AF
interaction ∝J0.
It is convenient to represent the Hamiltonian (3a) in
terms of the following matrices:
T(k) =

0 ϵk
ϵ∗
k
0

,
(12a)
V(q) =
cos(q/2) 0

,
(12b)
while the form of T leads us to the matrix representation
of G0(ω):
G0(k, ω) =

ω + iη
−ϵk
−ϵ∗
k
ω + iη
−1
,
(13)
and in the case of one magnon state (8), the magnon
energy Ωq (9) is taken into account by substituting ω →
ω −Ωq. The inverse could also be calculated explicitly;
however, it is not necessary for the present derivation.
We then proceed by utilizing the Dyson’s equation,
G(ω) = G0(ω) + G(ω)VG0(ω),
(14)
which, after separating G(k, ω), leads to the following
matrix equation,
G(k, ω) = [I + J0F(k, ω)]G0(k, ω)QG(k, ω),
(15)
where the various auxiliary matrices are given by:
F(k, ω) =
X
q
˜F(k, q, ω)V(q),
(16)
˜Fµν(k, q, ω) = ⟨FM|µk↓G(ω)ν†
k−q,↑S−
q |FM⟩.
(17)
Here ˜F(k, q, ω) is the anomalous Green’s function, calcu-
lated between diﬀerent magnon states, resulting from the
S−terms in V, and
QG(k, ω) =

I + J0SV0G0(k, ω)

(18)
V0 =

q
V(q)δq0 =

,
(19)
where QG(k, ω) is a transformation of G0(k, ω), perform-
ing a constant shift by J0S. However, this cannot be
written shortly as G0(k, ω + J0S), because of the matrix
V0 present in QG(k, ω), which causes a diﬀerent shift of
J0S/2 in the Gbb
0 (k, ω) sector.
The next step is to eliminate F(k, ω) from Eq. (15). In
order to do this, one needs to express ˜F(k, ω) explicitly in
terms of G(k, ω) by applying the Dyson’s equation (14)
once again and next solving for F(k, ω). After inserting
it back into Eq. (15) and solving for G(k, ω), one arrives
at the ﬁnal result,4

(20)
where M is a complicated matrix expressed solely, in terms
of various sums of G0(k −q, ω −Ωq) over q. More details
are presented in the Appendix. We note that this solution
is almost identical to the one obtained by Berciu in Ref.
33, only here we arrive at a more general solution for the
transformation of G0(k, ω). Finally, having calculated the
Green’s function, one ﬁnds the spectral function,
A(k, ω) = −1
π ℑ[G(k, ω)],
(21)
which is closely related to the density of states as well as to
the photoemission spectra, and can be directly measured
in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments.
The main physical problem is its structure and possible
quasiparticle (QP) states.
The Green’s function G(k, ω), as calculated from
Eq. (20), is generally not diagonal. This is usually not
a problem, since both diagonal components of the spec-
tral function are measured at once in experiment, which
corresponds to the trace of the corresponding matrix (21),
A(k, ω) = Tr A(k, ω),
(22)
a quantity invariant under the change of basis. Thus, we
also present here the traced spectral function A(k, ω). In
order to get more physical insight into the exact solution,
we will now derive the approximate solutions of the prob-
lem, in two opposite parameter regimes, strong and weak
hole-magnon coupling.
B.
Perturbative solution at strong coupling
First approach is the perturbation expansion, with the
problem treated in the eigenbasis of V. This solution is
valid in the strong coupling limit J0 ≫t and J0 ≫J,
since we treat T and HS as small perturbations to HK.
Given the conjectured states of the form µ†

(23e)
The ﬁrst two states are bound polaronic states, and the last two ones are the respective excited states. The
remaining state |m⟩k is a state dominated by magnons which dress an ↑-spin hole that propagates over a orbitals.
These deﬁnitions allow us to infer something about the approximate nature of diﬀerent bands calculated from the
Green’s function. Further, because V does not involve any three-site interaction terms but only self-renormalizing
exchange interaction, there is no distinction between s and p orbitals, and therefore in both cases the states derived in
perturbation theory (23) are the same. Using them, one can calculate the perturbation corrections to their energy
coming from HS and T . Owing to the speciﬁc orbital symmetries in the latter, in order to get a nontrivial contribution
(i.e., dispersion) one needs to conduct the perturbation expansion at least up to the second order. The resulting
energies for the states (23) are, respectively:

Mean ﬁeld approximation
Another approximate approach to the problem is the
mean ﬁeld (MF) approximation for V. In this case the
principle is to neglect the quantum spin ﬂuctuations in
HK, eﬀectively setting sm · Si ≈sz
mSz
i , where sm stands
for a spin in itinerant orbital, a or b, in the neighbor-
hood of site i. This assumption is valid provided the
whole HK brings only a minor contribution to the overall
energy, therefore implying J0 ≪t and J0 ≪J. From
Eq. (17) it follows that neglecting spin ﬂuctuations implies
˜F(k, q, ω) = 0, and thus (15) reduces to the MF solution
of the Green’s function,
GMF (k, ω) = G0(k, ω)QG(k, ω).
(25)
This equation depends only on G0(k, ω) and can be solved
analytically, yielding the mean ﬁeld energy dispersion,

(26)
This is also an exact solution of the model (1) with Ising
interactions in HK, and the deviation from it, reported
in Sec. IV, is due to quantum spin ﬂuctautions.
Furthermore, as already stated, Eq. (25) really corre-
sponds to G0(k, ω) shifted by J0S in the case of a band,
and by J0S/2 in the case of b states. Therefore, we expect
the MF solution (26) to resemble the free hole disper-
sion, shifted to the lower energy range by the appropriate
value, and with an energy gap of J0S/2 — indeed this
is the case, as we show in a broad range of parameters
in Sec. IV. We analyze there whether this prediction of
the MF approximation holds beyond the regime of weak
coupling J0 ≪t.
On the one hand, the two approximations described
above are expected to coincide with the exact solution in
their respective parameter ranges. Being among the most
established approximate methods for quantum many-body
systems, they serve as benchmarks of the method used
here. On the other hand, comparing their predictions with
the exact solution in the intermediate parameter range, i.e.
J0 ∼t and J0 ∼J, can give us a better understanding of
how biased exactly those methods are. This is especially
the case for the MF approach which is often employed as
a ﬁrst attempt at tackling a complicated problem.
IV.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
The obtained result for the Green’s function Eq. (20)
is exact, i.e., it follows from a rigorous derivation with no
approximations employed, but unfortunately it does not
allow one to calculate G(k, ω) analytically. In particular,
its central part, the matrix M(k, ω), has to be obtained
numerically. Below we present the numerical results ob-
tained for the spectral function A(k, ω) using this exact
scheme. In the numerical calculations we take t = 1 as
the energy unit and set J = 0.05t, η = 0.02t. We consider
the case of S = 1/2, where quantum spin ﬂuctuations
are the most important. We then explore the dependence
of the spectra on the value of the coupling constant J0

which controls the strength of the interaction between
localized spins and a hole in V.
Let us consider ﬁrst the strong coupling limit of
J0 = 10t, see Fig. 2. In this regime one expects that the
spectral function A(k, ω) consists of ﬁve features which
correspond to the perturbative states (23), with distinct
energies and rather weak dispersion. This analytic result
is conﬁrmed by a numerical solution, with the largest
intensities obtained for the two states with the lowest
energies.
We remark that the states obtained in the
perturbative regime have the same splitting of J0S/2 at
k = π as in the MF theory, but they appear at a much
lower energy due to formation of polaron states. This
demonstrates the importance of quantum spin ﬂuctua-
tions in the binding energies of these polaronic states,
which are neglected in the MF approximation. Quantum
spin ﬂuctuations enhance the binding energy roughly by
J0/2.
Consider next the systematic changes of the spectral
functions with increasing exchange coupling J0. Fig. 3
shows the spectral function density maps for the s orbital
symmetry for a wide range of J0 values. For intermediate
values of J0 it consists of distinct QP states and shadded
areas of scattering states. A nonlinear map scale has been7

applied in order to amplify the low-amplitude incoherent
part of the spectrum, which in reality is negligibly small.
The diversiﬁcation of QP states caused by the interaction
V can clearly be seen.
Starting from J0 = 0 two branches are seen, corre-
sponding to the free hole propagation of a ↓-spin hole and
exactly replicate the MF solution. Since in this situation
there is no interaction whatsoever, the added charge (hole)
propagates without coupling to the magnetic background.
Next, for J0 = 0.5t the two branches are seen to have
widened considerably and two new distinct features can
be identiﬁed: (i) one directly below the lower band and
corresponding to the ﬁrst polaronic state |¯a⟩, as shown by
solutions obtained within perturbation theory and com-
pared to the exact solution for large J0 = 10t (see Fig. 2),
and (ii) the other one located slightly above ω = 0, and
extending into the whole Brillouin zone for higher values
of J0. This latter feature fades away considerably and
gradually develops into the upper bound of the lower in-
coherent region, corresponding to |b⟩in the high coupling
regime. At J0 = t the original two branches have all but
disappeared, and the lowest polaron state has almost fully
developed.
Increasing the interaction further to J0 = 2t we see
that another state begins to emerge just slightly above
the lowest polaronic state, starting from k = π. This
state, corresponding to |¯b⟩in the strong coupling regime
then slowly develops while lowering further below the
incoherent continuum from which it emerged. Around
this point the incoherent part of the spectrum develops a
gap and divides into two distinct parts — the ﬁrst of which
has already been mentioned. The other one, situated at
a higher energy, develops later into the |a⟩state. Finally,
at J0 = 5t yet another state can be seen situated close to
ω = 0, seemingly with no dispersion. This state can be

identiﬁed as |m⟩and is purely magnonic, while the hole
has the reversed ↑-spin.
While it is clear that MF gives good approximations
for the weak coupling regime, a curious observation can
be made about the strong coupling. Looking at the MF
solutions plotted against the exact results for large values
of J0, one notices a surprising resemblance to the two
lowest-lying states |¯a⟩and |¯b⟩, save for some constant
energy shift. This indicates that MF approximation can
give relatively good qualitative results, predicting correct
dispersion for polaronic states, but introduces a system-
atic error, as it neglects the binding energy coming from
hole-magnon interaction. This explains the huge discrep-
ancy between MF energies and the exact energies found
for the polaron states.
It is also interesting to note that, while MF predicts the
gap to develop monotonically, the real solution develops a
gap shortly after the |¯a⟩state emerges from the incoherent
region of the spectrum. This gap then closes again at
around J0 = 2t and only after that does it reappear and
start to widen monotonically. For more details on the
evolution of the QP spectra with increasing parameter
J0/t, please refer to the Supplemental Material.34
Apart from calculations made for a wide range of J0
values for s symmetry, we have also done calculations for
p orbitals. However, because V in our model does not
distinguish between the two, the only diﬀerence will come
from their diﬀerence in dispersion. Taking into account
that sin(k/2) = cos[(π −k)/2], we expect the solution
for p orbitals to be a “mirror image” of the s-symmetry
solutions with respect to momentum k = π/2. Fig. 4
clearly demonstrates that this indeed is the case.
While the spectral maps are very useful in presenting
the entire spectra obtained for the present excat solution,
they do not give one a good sense of detail. For this reason,
in Fig. 5 we present an example of the spectra obtained8
for J0 = 5t for a few selected points k ∈[0, π] of the
Brillouin zone. All the ﬁve spectral features corresponding
to the states |¯a⟩k, |¯b⟩k, |m⟩k, |b⟩k and |a⟩k can be well
distinguished from one another. The two lowest states
clearly have the largest spectral weights.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
We have used the method developed by M¨oller,
Sawatzky and Berciu30 to calculate the exact Green’s
function and the spectral function for a simple model
of a single hole moving in a CuO3-like FM chain. Five
distinct spectral features are identiﬁed — three of which
arise from the hole propagating over the a orbitals along
the chain, and the other two follow from the hole within
apical b orbitals in a CuO3-like chain. By introducing a
realistic orbital structure for multi-band model, we ad-
dressed the problem of hole dynamics within p orbitals
in the charge-transfer model for a CuO3 chain. We have
then benchmarked this solution against the perturbation
theory at strong coupling and mean ﬁeld approximations.
We have found that both of these approaches coincide
quite well with the Green’s function solution in their re-
spective regimes of applicability, i.e., mean ﬁeld gives
realistic predictions for weak interactions, while the per-
turbation theory reproduces all the states reasonably well
in the strong coupling regime. The quantum states which
develop beyond the mean ﬁeld approximation will decrese
their spectral weight with increasing value of spin S. In
addition, the mean ﬁeld approach seems to recreate the
shapes of the polaronic bands at the strong coupling, but
highly underrates the binding energy.
The perturbation solution allows us for identiﬁcation
of ﬁve distinct states: two well deﬁned binding polaronic
bands and one nearly dispersionless purely magnonic band,
accompanied by two distinct excited polaronic states,
coupled by a broad continuum. These latter excited states
are much broader and have smaller spectral weights, even
for very strong coupling J0 ≫t, which can be understood
as following from the continuum of magnon excitations.
Furthermore, the |b⟩k, |a⟩k and |m⟩k states which develop
beyond the mean ﬁeld approximation will decrease their
spectral weight with increasing value of spin S in the
ferromagnetic chain. Indeed, the modiﬁcations of the
spectra arising from quantum spin ﬂuctuations are largest
for S = 1/2 and decrease with increasing S.
We also note that there is no essential diﬀerence be-
tween s and p orbital symmetries for the injected hole
in the model Eq. (1), which is a result of taking into
account only the exchange terms (second order two-site
p-d-p hopping). Therefore, such a simple model cannot
properly describe a system with O-based conductance,
reminiscent of doped cuprates. The simplest generaliza-
tion of the present model is to include the three-site p-d-p
terms,28 which distinguish orbital symmetry. This is an
interesting problem for future studies.

Appendix: Details of the exact solution Eq. (20)
Here we present the details of the calculation of the
anomalous Green’s function ˜F. After applying the Dyson’s
equation (14) to the Green’s function appearing in the
deﬁnition given in Eq. (17), one obtains
˜Fµν(k, q, ω) = ⟨FM|µk↓G(ω)Vν†
k−q,↑S−
q |FM⟩
× G0(k −q, ω −Ωq),
(A.1)
where the free-standing G0(ω) disappears due to the
anomalous average.
Since the total spin of the system is conserved, only one
spin-ﬂip is allowed in the FM background interacting with
the hole. Therefore, in the present case V can only leave
the same defected state (which causes a renormalization
of ˜F(k, q, ω)) or may reproduce the initial FM state by
means of a deexcitation of a magnon by a term ∝S+s−.
This leads directly to the following equation:

F(k, ω) used here is deﬁned in Eq. (16). Multiplying now
Eq. (A.5) either by V(q) or by ¯V(q) and summing over q,
one can ﬁnd explicit equations for F(k, ω) and ¯F(k, ω) in
terms of G(k, ω). Since ¯F(k, ω) serves only as an auxiliary
function, we will only present F(k, ω) here:
F(k, ω) = 2SG(k, ω)[I −M−1(k, ω)],
(A.7)
where we have already introduced the matrix M(k, ω),
deﬁned as follows:
M(k, ω) = I + J0 Gcc(k, ω) −J2
0 Gcs(k, ω)
× [I + J0Gss(k, ω)]−1Gsc(k, ω),
(A.8)
which is closely related to the self-energy. The auxiliary

(A.9d)
After plugging the solution Eq. (A.7) into Eq. (15) and
solving for G(k, ω), one obtains the ﬁnal result, Eq. (20)
of Sec. III A.
