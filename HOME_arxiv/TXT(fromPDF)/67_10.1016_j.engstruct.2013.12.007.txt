Abstract
An elasto-plastic model for concrete, based on a recently-proposed yield surface and simple hardening
laws, is formulated, implemented, numerically tested and validated against available test results.
The yield surface is smooth and particularly suited to represent the behaviour of rock-like materials,
such as concrete, mortar, ceramic and rock. A new class of isotropic hardening laws is proposed,
which can be given both an incremental and the corresponding ﬁnite form. These laws describe
a smooth transition from linear elastic to plastic behaviour, incorporating linear and nonlinear
hardening, and may approach the perfectly plastic limit in the latter case. The reliability of the
model is demonstrated by its capability of correctly describing the results yielded by a number of
well documented triaxial tests on concrete subjected to various conﬁnement levels. Thanks to its
simplicity, the model turns out to be very robust and well suited to be used in complex design
situations, as those involving dynamic loads.

Introduction
The mechanical behaviour of concrete is rather complex – even under monotonic and quasi-static load-
ing – because of a number of factors: (i.) highly nonlinear and (ii.) strongly inelastic response, (iii.)
anisotropic and (iv.) eventually localized damage accumulation with (v.) stiﬀness degradation, (vi.) con-
tractive and subsequently dilatant volumetric strain, leading to (vii.) progressively severe cracking. This
complexity is the macroscale counterpart of several concurrent and cooperative or antagonist micromech-
anisms of damage and stiﬀening, as for instance, pore collapse, microfracture opening and extension or
closure, aggregate debonding, and interfacial friction. It can therefore be understood that the consti-
tutive modelling of concrete (but also of similar materials such as rock, soil and ceramic) has been the
subject of an impressive research eﬀort, which, broadly speaking, falls within the realm of elastoplastic-
ity1, where the term ‘plastic’ is meant to include the damage as a speciﬁc inelastic mechanism. In fact,

1 The research on elastoplastic modelling of concrete has reached its apex in the seventies and eighties of the past
century, when so many models have been proposed that are now hard to even only be summarized (see among others,
Bazant et al., 2000; Chen and Han, 1988; Krajcinovic et al., 1991; Yazdani and Schreyer, 1990). Although nowadays other
approaches are preferred, like those based on particle mechanics (Schauﬀert and Cusatis, 2012), the aim of the present
article is to formulate a relatively simple and robust model, something that is diﬃcult to be achieved with advanced models.

arXiv:1404.6450v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  24 Apr 2014elastoplasticity is a theoretical framework allowing the possibility of a phenomenological description of
all the above-mentioned constitutive features of concrete in terms of: (i.) yield function features, (ii.)
coupling elastic and plastic deformation, (iii.) ﬂow-rule nonassociativity, and (iv.) hardening sources
and rules (Bigoni, 2012). However, the usual problem arising from a reﬁned constitutive description in
terms of elastoplasticity is the complexity of the resulting model, which may lead to several numerical
diﬃculties related to the possible presence of yield surface corners, discontinuity of hardening, lack of
self-adjointness due to nonassociativity and failure of ellipticity of the rate equations due to strain soft-
ening. As a consequence, reﬁned models often lack numerical robustness or slow down the numerical
integration to a level that the model becomes of awkward, if not impossible, use. A ‘minimal’ and robust
constitutive model, not obsessively accurate but able to capture the essential phenomena related to the
progressive damage occurring during monotonic loading of concrete, is a necessity to treat complex load
situations.
The essential ‘ingredients’ of a constitutive model are a convex, smooth yield surface capable of an
excellent interpolation of data and a hardening law describing a smooth transition between elasticity
and a perfectly plastic behaviour. Exclusion of strain softening, together with ﬂow rule associativity,
is the key to preserve ellipticity, and thus well-posedness of the problem.
In the present paper, an
elastoplastic model is formulated, based on the so-called ‘BP yield surface’ (Bigoni and Piccolroaz, 2004;
Piccolroaz and Bigoni, 2009; Bigoni, 2012) which is shown to correctly describe the damage envelope
of concrete, and on an inﬁnite class of isotropic hardening rules (given both in incremental form and in
the corresponding ﬁnite forms), depending on a hardening parameter. Within a certain interval for this
parameter hardening is unbounded (with linear hardening obtained as a limiting case), while outside
this range a smooth hardening/perfectly-plastic transition is described. The proposed model does not
describe certain phenomena which are known to occur in concrete, such as for instance anisotropy of
damage, softening, and elastic degradation, but provides a simple and robust tool, which is shown to
correctly represent triaxial test results at high conﬁning pressure.

Elastoplasticity and the constitutive model
This section provides the elastoplastic constitutive model in terms of incremental equations. The form
of the yield surface is given, depending on the stress invariants and a set of material parameters. A
new class of hardening laws is formulated in order to describe a smooth transition from linear elastic to
plastic behaviour.
2.1
Incremental constitutive equations
The decomposition of the strain into the elastic (ϵe) and plastic (ϵp) parts as
ϵ = ϵe + ϵp
(1)
yields the incremental elastic strain in the form
˙ϵe = ˙ϵ −˙ϵp.
(2)
The ‘accumulated plastic strain’ is deﬁned as follows
πa =
Z t
0
|˙ϵp| dτ,
(3)
where t is the time-like variable governing the loading increments. Introducing the ﬂow rule
˙ϵp = ˙λP ,
(4)
2where P is the gradient of the plastic potential, we obtain that the rate of the accumulated plastic strain
is proportional to the plastic multiplier ( ˙λ ≥0) as
˙πa = ˙λ |P | .
(5)
A substitution of eq. (2) and eq. (4) into the incremental elastic constitutive equation relating the
increment of stress ˙σ to the increment of elastic strain ˙ϵe through a fourth-order elastic tensor E as
˙σ = E˙ϵe, yields
˙σ = E˙ϵ −˙λEP .
(6)
Note that, for simplicity, reference is made to isotropic elasticity, so that the elastic tensor E is deﬁned
in terms of elastic modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν.
During plastic loading, the stress point must satisfy the yield condition F(σ, k) = 0 at every time
increment, so that the Prager consistency can be written as
˙F = Q · ˙σ + ∂F
∂k · ˙k = 0,
(7)
where Q = ∂F/∂σ is the yield function gradient and k is the hardening parameters vector.
By deﬁning the hardening modulus H(σ, k) as
∂F
∂k · ˙k = −˙λH(σ, k),
(8)
eq. (7) can be rewritten in the form
Q · ˙σ −˙λH = 0
(9)
Further, the plastic multiplier can be obtained from eq. (6) and eq. (9)
˙λ =
Q · E˙ϵ
H + Q · EP .
(10)
Finally, a substitution of eq. (10) into eq. (6) yields the elasto-plastic constitutive equations in the rate
form
˙σ = E˙ϵ −
Q · E˙ϵ
H + Q · EP EP ,
(11)
where, for simplicity, the associative ﬂow rule P = Q, will be adopted in the sequel.
2.2

2004)

S = σ −tr σ

(13)
in which S is the deviatoric stress and I is the identity tensor.
The seven-parameters BP yield function F (Bigoni and Piccolroaz, 2004) is deﬁned as
F(σ) = f(p) +

(15)
and f(p) = +∞, if (p + c)/(pc + c) /∈[0, 1].

‘deviatoric function’ (proposed by Podgórski, 1985 and independently by Bigoni and Piccolroaz, 2004)

pc > 0,
c ≥0,
0 < α < 2,
m > 1,
0 ≤β ≤2,
0 ≤γ < 1
deﬁne the shape of the associated yield surface. In particular, M controls the pressure-sensitivity, pc
and c are the yield strengths under ideal isotropic compression and tension, respectively. Parameters α
and m deﬁne the distortion of the meridian section, while β and γ model the shape of the deviatoric
section.
2.3
An inﬁnite class of hardening laws
In order to simulate the nonlinear hardening of concrete, the following class of hardening rules in incre-
mental form is proposed:
˙pc =
k1
(1 + δπa)n ˙πa,
(17)
˙c = Ω˙pc,
(18)
where four material parameters have been introduced: k1 > 0, δ ≥0, n > 0, and 0 < Ω< 1.
A substitution of the ﬂow rule (4) into (17) and (18) yields
˙pc = ˙λ
k1
(1 + δπa)n |P | ,
(19)
˙c = ˙λ
Ωk1
(1 + δπa)n |P | .
(20)
Eqs. (17) and (18) can be integrated in order to obtain the hardening laws in ﬁnite form as follows
pc =







pc0 + k1
δ log(1 + δπa),
n = 1,
pc0 + k1
δ
(1 + δπa)n−1 −1
(n −1)(1 + δπa)n−1 ,
n ̸= 1.
(21)
c −c0 = Ω(pc −pc0).
(22)
In order to gain insight on the physical meaning of the proposed class of hardening rules, let us consider
the asymptotic behaviour of the ﬁnite form (21) as πa →0, which turns out to be independent of the
parameters δ and n and is given by the formula
pc = pc0 + k1πa + O(π2
a).
(23)
4This formula shows that, at an early stage of plastic deformation, the hardening is linear with a slope
governed by the parameter k1.
On the other hand, the hardening at a later stage of plastic deformation is governed by the parameters
δ and n. This is made clear by considering the asymptotic behaviour of the ﬁnite form (21) as πa →∞:
pc =







k1
δ log(δπa) + pc0 +
k1
δ2πa
+ O(π−2

n = 1,
pc0 +
k1
(n −1)δ −
k1
(n −1)δ(δπa)n−1 + O(π−n
a ),
n ̸= 1.
(24)
Note that, for 0 < n ≤1, pc turns out to be unbounded and for n = 1 there is a logarithmic growth of
hardening. For n > 1, pc is bounded (Fig. 1) with a limit value given by
pc0 +
k1
(n −1)δ .

Figure 1: The inﬁnite class of hardening laws corresponding to eq. (21). Curves are obtained by setting the parameters
k1 and δ to the conventional values k1 = 10000 MPa, δ = 30, and varying the parameter n.
With the deﬁnition of the hardening law, the proposed elastoplastic constitutive model is ready to be
calibrated, implemented and tested, which is the subject of the following Sections, where two members
of the class of hardening laws will be analyzed, namely, n = 1 and n = 2, the former corresponding to
the logarithmic growth of hardening and the latter approaching the perfectly plastic behaviour.

Calibration of material parameters and comparison with ex-
perimental results
3.1
Calibration of the BP yield surface
The BP yield surface has been calibrated on the basis of available experiments (He and Song, 2008;
Kotsovos and Newman, 1980; Kupfer et al., 1969; Lee et al., 2004; Tasuji et al., 1978), to model the
behaviour of concrete in the p–q plane (Fig. 2) and in the biaxial σ1/fc–σ2/fc plane (Fig. 3), where fc
(taken positive) deﬁnes the failure for compressive uniaxial stress. We have assumed a ratio between fc
and the failure stress in uniaxial tension ft equal to 10.
The parameter values which have been found to provide the better interpolation of experimental data
for the three concretes (identiﬁed by their uniaxial compressive strengths fc = 31.7 MPa, fc = 46.9
MPa, and fc = 62.1 MPa) reported by Kotsovos and Newman (1980) are given in Tab. 1.

A validation of the model against triaxial tests
The above-presented constitutive model has been implemented in a UMAT routine of ABAQUS Standard
Ver. 6.11-1 (Simulia, Providence, RI).
Triaxial compression tests at high pressure on cylindrical concrete specimen (experimental data taken
from Kotsovos and Newman, 1980) have been simulated using two diﬀerent hardening laws of the class
(17)–(18), namely n = 1, corresponding to logarithmic hardening, and n = 2, which provides a smooth
6transition to perfect plasticity. The values of parameters (identifying elastic behaviour and hardening)
used in the simulations are reported in Tab. 2.

with n = 1 leads to a more stable numerical behaviour, while with n = 2 failure can be approached.

Conclusions
A reasonably simple inelastic model for concrete has been formulated on the basis of a recently-proposed
yield function and a class of hardening rules, which may describe a smooth transition from linear elastic
to perfectly plastic behaviour. The model has been implemented into a numerical routine and successfully
validated against available triaxial experiments at diﬀerent conﬁning pressures. Although the presented
constitutive approach cannot compete in accuracy with more sophisticated models, it has been proven to
be robust for numerical calculations, so that it results particularly suitable for complex design situations
where easy of calibration, fast convergence and stability become important factors.
