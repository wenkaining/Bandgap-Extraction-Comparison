Abstract
We quantify the mechanisms for manganese (Mn) diﬀusion through graphene in
Mn/graphene/Ge (001) and Mn/graphene/GaAs (001) heterostructures for samples
prepared by graphene layer transfer versus graphene growth directly on the semicon-
ductor substrate. These heterostructures are important for applications in spintronics;
however, challenges in synthesizing graphene directly on technologically important sub-
strates such as GaAs necessitate layer transfer and anneal steps, which introduce de-
fects into the graphene. In-situ photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that
Mn diﬀusion through graphene grown directly on a Ge (001) substrate is 1000 times
lower than Mn diﬀusion into samples without graphene (Dgr,direct ∼4 × 10−18cm2/s,
Dno−gr ∼5×10−15 cm2/s at 500◦C). Transferred graphene on Ge suppresses the Mn in
Ge diﬀusion by a factor of 10 compared to no graphene (Dgr,transfer ∼4×10−16cm2/s).
For both transferred and directly-grown graphene, the low activation energy (Ea ∼
0.1−0.5 eV) suggests that Mn diﬀusion through graphene occurs primarily at graphene
defects. This is further conﬁrmed as the diﬀusivity prefactor, D0, scales with the de-
fect density of the graphene sheet. Similar diﬀusion barrier performance is found on

Introduction
Graphene is a promising monolayer diﬀusion barrier for applications such as oxidation resis-
tance,1 metal contacts to semiconductors,2,3 and semiconductor spintronics.4 Compared to
conventional diﬀusion barriers that typically need to be tens of nanometers thick, graphene
can remain eﬀective as a diﬀusion barrier down to thicknesses of several atomic layers,2 and in
select cases a single atomic layer.3 This extreme thinness is highly attractive for applications
where a nearly electronically transparent interface is desired, for example, spin injection via
tunneling.4 Moreover, recent reports of “remote epitaxy” suggest it is possible to synthesize
epitaxial ﬁlms through a monolayer graphene barrier,5–7 opening the possibility of epitaxial
metal/graphene/semiconductor heterostructures that would otherwise not be stable due to
signiﬁcant metal/semiconductor interdiﬀusion.8
A fundamental challenge, however, is that graphene cannot be synthesized directly on
arbitrary substrates. While graphene can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
on Ge and noble metal surfaces (e.g., Cu, Ag, Pt), the high synthesis temperatures and
catalytic reactions at the surface currently preclude growth directly on technologically im-
portant compound semiconductor substrates such as GaAs and InP. The use of non-native
substrates necessitates post-synthesis large-area graphene layer transfer and annealing, which
can damage the graphene by introducing contaminants such as oxides and polymer residues,
and creating tears, wrinkles, and point defects on the larger length scales relevant to device
applications.9 Previous studies have explored the qualitative impacts of defects on graphene
diﬀusion barriers.2,10,11 However, the speciﬁc eﬀect of the layer transfer process, elevated
2temperatures during growth, and a quantiﬁcation of the diﬀusivity through graphene has
not yet been reported.
Here we quantify the eﬀectiveness of layer-transferred vs directly-grown graphene as a
monolayer diﬀusion barrier for Mn ﬁlms, grown on GaAs and Ge substrates. The choice
of Mn on a semiconductor is motivated by applications in spintronics. For example, the
Mn-containing half metallic ferromagnets NiMnSb and Co2MnSi are promising materials for
spin injection into GaAs.12,13 Sample structures consisted of a thin Mn ﬁlm (1.64 × 1016
atoms/cm2, ∼24 ˚A) grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on graphene-terminated Ge
or GaAs (001) substrates. We evaluate two graphene preparations: (1) epitaxial graphene
that is directly grown on a Ge substrate and (2) transferred graphene that is grown on a
sacriﬁcial Cu foil and then wet transferred to a Ge or GaAs substrate. We show that the
combination of graphene transfer and pre-growth annealing creates tears and pinholes in the
graphene, as quantiﬁed by Raman spectroscopy and identiﬁed by scanning electron micrso-
copy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements reveal that both transferred and directly-grown graphene suppress
diﬀusion into the semiconductor substrate.
Directly-grown graphene on Ge signiﬁcantly
outperforms the layer transferred versions, decreasing the diﬀusivity at 500◦C two orders of
magnitude compared to the layer transferred version. We quantify the eﬀective diﬀusivities
and activation energies for Mn diﬀusion on graphene-terminated Ge and GaAs, and discuss
mechanisms for diﬀusion with and without tears and pinholes.

Experimental
CVD growth of graphene on Ge (001) and Cu foils. We use two preparations of
graphene: graphene that is grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) directly on Ge (001),
and graphene that is grown by CVD on Cu foils and then layer transferred onto Ge (001) or
GaAs (001). For CVD graphene growth on Ge (001) we followed growth conditions described
3in Refs.14,15 CVD graphene on Cu foils was performed at 1050 ◦C using ultra high purity
CH4, as described in Ref.7
Graphene transfer onto Ge (001) and GaAs (001). Our graphene transfer pro-
cess is similar to other polymer-assisted wet transfers reported in previous works.7,16 The
graphene/Cu foils were cut into 5 by 5 mm pieces and ﬂattened using cleaned glass slides.
Approximately 300 nm of 495K C2 PMMA (Chlorobenzene base solvent, 2% by wt., Mi-
croChem) was spin coated on the graphene/Cu foil substrate at 2000 RPM for 2 minutes and
left to cure at room temperature for 24 hours. Graphene on the backside of the Cu foil was
removed via reactive ion etching using 90 W O2 plasma at a pressure of 100 mTorr for 30s.
The Cu foil was then etched by placing the PMMA/graphene/Cu foil stack on the surface of
an etch solution containing 1-part ammonium persulfate (APS-100, Transene) and 3-parts
H2O. After 16 hours of etching at room temperature, the ﬂoating PMMA/graphene mem-
brane was scooped up with a clean glass slide and sequentially transferred into ﬁve 5-minute
water baths to rinse the etch residuals. Prior to scooping the graphene with the GaAs (001)
substrate, the native oxide is etched in a 10% HCl bath for 30 seconds. The GaAs is then
rinsed in isopropanol and nitrogen dried. Prior to scooping with the Ge (001) substrate, the
native oxide is etched in a hot (90◦C) RO water bath for 15 minutes. Immediately after the
etching process, the substrate is used to scoop the PMMA/graphene membrane from the
ﬁnal water bath. To remove water at the graphene/substrate interface, samples were baked
in air at 50◦C for 5 minutes, then slowly ramped to 150◦C and baked for another 10 minutes.
The PMMA was dissolved by submerging the sample in an acetone bath at 80◦C for 3 hours.
Samples are then rinsed in isopropanol and dried with nitrogen.
Graphene surface preparation and manganese ﬁlm growth. Bare Ge substrates
were sequentially degreased for 15 minutes in acetone, 15 minutes in isopropanol baths, and
then etched in reverse-osmosis (RO) water at 90◦C for 30 minutes. No solvent treatments
were performed to the bare GaAs substrates. All samples were indium-bonded to a molyb-
denum sample holder to ensure good thermal contact. Samples were outgassed in a high
4vacuum load lock (p < 5 × 10−8 Torr) for at least 1 hour at 150◦C prior to transferring into
the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chamber (p < 5×10−10 Torr).
In the MBE chamber, the graphene-terminated samples were further outgassed at ∼
300◦C to remove residual organic contaminants. Select graphene samples were characterized
by SEM, AFM, and Raman spectroscopy after the ∼300◦C outgas (labelled “pre-anneal” in
Fig. 1). Following the ∼300◦C outgas, graphene samples were annealed at roughly 600◦C
to remove native oxides. Removal of surface oxides was conﬁrmed via reﬂection high energy
electron diﬀraction (RHEED). For the bare GaAs substrate, a thick GaAs buﬀer layer was
grown to smoothen the surface before Mn growth. No buﬀer layers were grown on the other
samples.
Thin Mn ﬁlms (1.64×1016 atoms/cm2) were grown at room temperature, using an elemen-
tal eﬀusion cell. The thickness was measured using an in-situ quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) that has been calibrated through ex-situ Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy
(RBS).
In-situ photoemission. Immediately following growth, samples were transferred through
an ultrahigh vacuum manifold (p < 5×10−9 Torr) to a connected photoemission spectroscopy
chamber. X-ray photoemission specroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using a
non-monochromated Omicron DAR-400 dual anode x-ray source (Al Kα, hν = 1486.6 eV)
and an Omicron EA125 hemispherical analyzer. The total energy resolution of the analyzer
in the experimental conﬁguration was measured to be 1.08 eV using an Au standard. The
photoemission chamber pressure was maintained at < 3 × 10−10 Torr during the measure-
ments.
At each anneal step the samples were ramped from room temperature to the desired an-
neal setpoint temperature over 5 minutes. The sample was held at temperature (±10◦C) for
5 minutes and then rapidly cooled to room temperature. Sample temperature was measured
by a thermocouple attached to the sample manipulator, roughly 1 cm away from the sample.
The thermocouple was calibrated using the melting point of indium and the arsenic desorp-
5tion temperature of As-capped GaAs. The sample was transferred immediately following the
cool down back into the photoemission stage before beginning the next XPS measurement.
Raman and scanning electron microscopy. Graphene was characterized using ﬁeld
emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss LEO 1530 Gemini).
Raman spec-
troscopy was performed using a 532 nm wavelength laser (Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution
Spectrometer). The laser power is ﬁxed at 10 mW and a 300 gr/mm diﬀraction grating is
used for every scan. This results in a spectral resolution of 2.5 cm−1 and a spatial resolu-
tion of 0.5 µm. Each scan presented is an average spectrum consisting of 400 scans over a
representative 100 µm2 area of the graphene surface.

7Fig. 1 illustrates the diﬀerences between the directly-grown graphene versus graphene
that has been layer transferred onto Ge. We ﬁrst examine the samples after light outgassing
at 300◦C to remove solvents and adsorbates, but before full annealing (labelled “pre-anneal”,
Fig.
1).
For direct-growth graphene on Ge, the primary feature observed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) is faceting of the Ge (001) surface (Fig. 1a, left), as has been
observed previously.17 In contrast, the layer-transferred graphene on Ge displays a network
of grain boundaries and wrinkles as labelled by the yellow arrows (Fig.
1b, left).
The
grain boundaries originate from graphene growth on polycrystalline Cu foils (Supporting
Information Fig. ??). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements conﬁrm the grain
boundaries and wrinkles for transferred graphene (Fig. ??b, left). Neither layer transferred
nor directly grown graphene show obvious signs of holes or tears prior to annealing in SEM
or AFM measurements. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1d) shows the ID/IG integrated intensity
ratio for the direct and layer transferred graphene on Ge before anneal are similar (0.3 and
0.5, respectively), indicative of a similar defect density.18,19 Layer-transferred graphene on
GaAs (001) exhibits qualitatively similar surface morphology and Raman spectra as the
graphene transferred onto Ge (001) (Fig. 1c, left).
After annealing in ultrahigh vacuum at 600◦C, which is necessary to remove substrate
native oxides prior to ﬁlm deposition,20,21 we observe stark contrast between the two diﬀerent
graphene preparations. For directly grown graphene on Ge, our Raman, SEM, and AFM
measurements display negligible diﬀerences before and after annealing (Fig. 1a, right). AFM
measurements reveal faint wrinkles in the graphene layer formed after annealing (Supporting
Information Fig. ??), but no obvious formation of tears (Fig. 1a) and negligible changes
in the Raman ID/IG ratio (Fig. 1d, red curves). In contrast, for layer-transferred graphene
our SEM and AFM measurements reveal holes and tears that appear to originate at grain
boundaries (green arrows in Fig. 1b (right) and Supporting Information Fig. ??). This
increase in defect density is further conﬁrmed through Raman spectroscopy, where we observe
a dramatic increase in the Raman ID/IG ratio for transferred graphene after annealing (Fig.
81d, blue curves), indicating the creation of tears and other defects. We observe a similar
increase in the tear density and Raman ID/IG ratio for transferred graphene on GaAs after
annealing (Fig. 1c).
We hypothesize that the anneal-induced tears are created by desorption of native oxides
that are trapped between the substrate and layer transferred graphene. Previous in-situ
XPS measurements demonstrate that layer transferred graphene on III-V substrates con-
tains oxides trapped at the graphene/III-V interface.22 Desorption of these interfacial oxides
creates pinholes in the graphene. We expect transferred graphene/Ge to behave similarly. In
contrast, graphene that is directly grown on Ge does not have these interfacial contaminants,
and thus does not show an increased defect density after annealing.
We now measure the diﬀusion barrier performance for Mn thin ﬁlms grown on the above
graphene-terminated samples. After loading the graphene/Ge samples into vacuum and an-
nealing at 600 C, Mn thin ﬁlms (1.64 × 1016 atoms/cm2, ∼24 ˚A) were grown by molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) at room temperature. After growth, samples were transferred via an
ultrahigh vacuum manifold to a connected X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) cham-
ber. In this way, we measure clean XPS spectra of samples that have not been exposed to
air. Further details are described in Methods.
Figure 2c presents in-situ photoemission spectra tracking the evolution of Mn surface
composition for Mn ﬁlms grown on Ge substrates, with and without a graphene barrier.
Each sample was subjected to a series of anneal steps at increasing temperature up to 500
◦C. To eliminate variations in sample alignment, all spectra are normalized to the integrated
Ge 3p core level intensity.
For the Mn ﬁlm grown directly on Ge (black curves), with
increasing anneal temperature the intensity of the Mn 2p rapidly decreases, corresponding
to a decrease in the relative surface Mn composition. For Mn on transferred graphene (blue
curves) and on direct-growth graphene (red curves), the Mn 2p core level decay is suppressed.
To compare the relative changes in surface Mn concentration, we ﬁt the Mn 2p and Ge
3p core levels to Doniach-Sunjic23 and Voigt lineshapes, respectively, and plot the relative

(IMn2p/Isub)0 (Fig. 2d, sub = Ge 3p). Here the
numerator with subscript T refers to the Mn 2p / Ge 3p intensity ratio after anneal at
temperature T and the denominator with subscript 0 refers to the Mn 2p / Ge 3p intensity
ratio as-grown, before additional annealing. This normalization procedure cancels out the
instrumental sensitivity, alignment, and photoemission cross section.
We ﬁnd that the directly-grown graphene performs best as a diﬀusion barrier, with RMn
decreasing to only 0.7 after an anneal up to 500◦C, compared to RMn = 0.05 for the sample
without graphene. Transferred graphene also suppresses interdiﬀusion compared to the bare

substrate. For the no graphene sample there is a distinct onset of interdiﬀusion around
150◦C, at which point RMn rapidly decreases. There is no distinct onset for the samples with
graphene barriers. Together, these results demonstrate that both transferred and directly-
grown graphene are eﬀective solid state diﬀusion barriers for Mn in Ge, and that directly-
grown graphene is most eﬀective.
We next estimate the temperature-dependent diﬀusion length based on the relative
changes in the Mn 2p / Ge 3p intensity ratio, RMn. For a very thin Mn ﬁlm on a semi-inﬁnite
substrate, the solution to the diﬀusion equation is a half Gaussian composition proﬁle (Fig.
112b)

where λ is the diﬀusion length and ntotal = 1.64×1016 atoms/cm2 is the total areal density of
Mn deposited. We deﬁne the as-deposited initial condition such that the Mn concentration
at the surface (z = 0) is equal to the density of pure Mn, i.e. cMn(0, λ0) = c0 = 8.2 × 1022
atoms/cm3. This yields an initial diﬀusion length of λ0 = 11 ˚A. For simplicity, we let the
Ge composition proﬁle be cGe(z) = c0 −cMn(z), assuming that pure Mn, pure Ge, and the
diﬀused Mn-Ge have approximately the same atomic densities and layer spacings.
From these composition proﬁles we calculate the expected intensity ratios for Mn 2p and
Ge 3p, as a function of the diﬀusion length. The intensity of core level x is given by

factor, and σx is the photoemission cross section. We rewrite the composition proﬁles in
terms of atomic density, nx,i = d ∗cx(z, t), where d is the atomic layer spacing, and calculate
the photoemission intensities IMn and IGe, subject to the initial condition λ0 = 11 ˚A. We
then compute the normalized Mn intensity ratio RMn = (IMn/IGe)T
(IMn/IGe)0 , such that fx and σx are
cancelled out. In this way, the experimentally measured RMn is uniquely deﬁned by the
diﬀusion length λ after each sequential anneal.
Fig. 2(e) shows the estimated diﬀusion length, obtained by ﬁtting the experimentally
measured RMn to the calculated intensity ratios from Eqs 1 and 2. We ﬁnd that compared
to the bare Ge substrate, directly-grown graphene on Ge suppresses the diﬀusion length by
a factor of just under 11 and layer transferred graphene suppresses the diﬀusion length by a
factor 3.5, at a temperature of 500 ◦C.
12In-situ photoemission measurements for Mn on GaAs substrates reveal similar behavior
as the samples on Ge (Fig. 3). For the Mn directly on GaAs (Fig. 3a, black curves), in the
as-grown spectrum we observe a secondary component at higher binding energy, indicative
of reactions or secondary phases between Mn and GaAs. This reacted component grows
with increased annealing. We attribute these secondary components to the formation of
Mn2As and MnGa phases, as has been observed previously at Mn/GaAs interfaces without
graphene.25 Comparison of the normalized Mn 2p intensity RMn and the estimated diﬀusion
length reveal that like Ge, transferred graphene suppresses interdiﬀusion into GaAs.

D0 as listed in Table I. We ﬁnd that at 500 ◦C, the diﬀusivity for Mn on directly-grown
graphene / Ge (red curve) is a factor of 1000 lower than the diﬀusivity on bare Ge (black

behavior is observed for transferred graphene/GaAs compared to bare GaAs. To benchmark
the accuracy of our method, we ﬁnd that our experimentally determined diﬀusivities for
Mn on bare GaAs (Fig.

experiments (open black circles).26–28

We now discuss the mechanisms for Mn diﬀusion based on the experimentally determined
14Ea and D0. Our experimentally determined activation energy of 0.8 eV for Mn diﬀusing into
bare GaAs and Ge agrees well with previous experiments and DFT calculations for Mn
interstitial diﬀusion into GaAs (0.7 −0.8 eV29).
Substitutional diﬀusion is expected to
exhibit a higher activation energy of 2-3 eV.30
In comparison, Ea for Mn diﬀusion into graphene-terminated substrates is considerably
lower: 0.1 eV for directly-grown graphene on Ge, and 0.2-0.5 eV for transferred graphene
on GaAs and Ge. We immediately rule out transverse diﬀusion through pristine graphene,
since diﬀusion through graphene in the absence of defects is expected to have a very large
activation energy barrier of Ea ∼12 eV.31 This is because the eﬀective pore size of graphene
is small (∼0.7 ˚A radius of a carbon ring, less than half the radius of a Mn atom). Therefore,
we expect that Mn diﬀusion through graphene occurs primarily through defect-mediated
processes.
The range of measured activation energies suggests several mechanisms for Mn diﬀusion
through graphene defects may be possible. At high temperatures (T > 200◦C, or 1000/T <
2.1 K−1), we speculate that our extracted Ea is lower on graphene-terminated substrates
than on bare substrates due to reactions being catalyzed at graphene defects, since graphene
defects are known to be chemically active.2,32 At this point we do not have suﬃcient data
to determine the mechanisms of diﬀusion lower temperatures, T < 200◦C (or 1000/T > 2.1
K−1, Fig. 4 dotted lines). The range of measured activation energies may also reﬂect a
convolution of surface and bulk diﬀusion, in which Mn adatoms ﬁrst diﬀuse laterally to
reactive pinhole sites before then diﬀusing into the substrate (Fig.
4c).
First-principles
calculations suggest that the activation energy for lateral diﬀusion of Mn on graphene is
60 meV33 and Cu on graphene is 10-20 meV,34 similar to the activation energies extracted
from our photoemission measurements (Table 1). More detailed experiments with lateral
and depth resolution, at a broader range of temperatures, are needed to fully understand
the detailed diﬀusion mechanisms through graphene.
While a low activation energy barrier favors a large diﬀusivity, the origin of the dramatic
15decrease of diﬀusivity for graphene-terminated samples is the reduction of the prefactor D0.
We interpret D0 to scale as an attempt rate for diﬀusion. For Mn on bare GaAs and Ge
substrates, the attempt rates of 10−11−10−10 cm2/s are high because there are many available
sites for interstitial diﬀusion into the substrate. On the other hand, attempt rates are lower
on the graphene-terminated substrates because Mn diﬀusion through graphene requires a
defect in the graphene. This rate is higher for layer transferred graphene (10−17 −10−13
cm2/s) than for directly-grown graphene (10−17 cm2/s), since the layer-transferred graphene
has a higher defect density as quantiﬁed by our Raman, SEM, and AFM measurements (Fig.
1 and Supporting Information Fig. ??). Note that ﬁlm/substrate interactions35 and doping36
can modify Raman intensity ratios,37 therefor it is diﬃcult to make direct comparisons of
gr/Ge and gr/GaAs defect densities based on the ID/IG ratio (Fig. 1d). Further experiments
are required to correlate speciﬁc defect types (e.g. tears, wrinkles, pinholes, vacancies) with
speciﬁc values of the diﬀusivity.

Conclusions
Our results show that layer-transferred and directly-grown graphene suppress Mn diﬀusion
into semiconductor substrates. The directly-grown graphene displays superior diﬀusion bar-
rier performance due to a lower defect density, as quantiﬁed by Raman spectroscopy and SEM
after annealing but before Mn ﬁlm growth. Translating these performance enhancements to
functional substrates at wafer scale will require direct graphene synthesis approaches on the
substrate of interest. For example, CVD approaches using small molecules,38 activated pre-
cursors,39 or plasma-enhanced CVD processes40–42 show promise for reducing the graphene
synthesis temperature, and may be a route for graphene growth directly on GaAs and other
technologically important compound semiconductors.

arXiv:2106.01239v3  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  11 Sep 2021Figure S-1: SEM of CVD graphene grown on Cu foil. Plan-view scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the graphene as-grown on copper foil via standard chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) growth techniques. The main structure observed in the graphene
is a few large-scale wrinkles and grain boundaries. The well-ordered parallel line structure
observed is a result of the underlying structure of the Cu foil.
2Figure S-2: AFM characterization of gr/Ge (001) surfaces. (a) Atomic force mi-
croscopy (AFM) images of the graphene directly grown on Ge (001) substrates before (left)
and after (right) annealing. Prior to annealing, the morphology is dominated by facets from
the underlying Ge (001).? Features from the graphene are less obvious. After annealing
at 600◦C, the graphene develops large-scale wrinkles; however, no noticeable tears or holes
have formed. (b) AFM images of transferred graphene on Ge (001) substrates before (left)
and after (right) annealing. Prior to annealing the major defect structure is the wrinkles
and grain boundaries observed originally via SEM prior to the transfer process (Fig S-1).
The underlying terrace structure of the Cu foil also produces a very small ripple-like wrinkle
in the graphene at regular intervals. After annealing, the graphene appears to rip apart at
some of the grain boundaries, forming a network of tears in the graphene.
3Figure S-3: Deconvolution near the Raman D peak for transferred graphene. For
transferred graphene after annealing, we observe broad peaks (labelled 1 and 3) in the vicinity
of the graphene D peak. We attribute these broad peaks to amorphous carbonaceous species
from polymer residuals, consistent with previous studies.?
To extract the D component
(labelled 0) and quantify an integrated ID/IG ratio, we ﬁt the data using multiple Gaussian
lineshapes.
