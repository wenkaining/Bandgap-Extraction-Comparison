Abstract
Following H. Tomita and C. Murakami [30] we propose an analytical
model to predict critical probability of percolation.
It is based on
the excursion set theory which allows us to consider N-dimensional
bounded regions. Details are given for the 3D case and statistically
Representative Volume Elements are calculated. Finally generalisation
to the N-dimensional case is made.

Introduction
The mass transfer properties of randomly distributed porous media are of
major interest since they are involved in countless applications.
Derived
from chemistry [5] but ﬁrst expressed by [3] as a statistical-geometry model,
percolation on random stochastic patterns was used to study a ﬂuid ﬂow
through a rock assumed to be a network of channels, randomly open or
close. These problems are often treated through a lattice discretisation of
space and a set of arbitrary rules (often referred as bond or site percolation)
in order to deﬁne inﬁnite cluster, which are paths for the mass transfer.
Here the quantity of interest is the critical (or percolation) probability pc
that deﬁnes, according to a statistical point of view, whether an inﬁnite
cluster exists or not.
For materials science, considering inﬁnite size domains as well as inﬁnite
clusters is not the most convenient. In percolation theory, classical upscaling
procedures use, for example, cluster statistics to overcome this limitation
[11]. Following [30] and extending it to bounded regions in space, we propose
1to use excursion sets of correlated Random Fields (hereafter noted RF) and
their underlying predictable properties [2] in order to tackle this problematic
by the mean of topology quantiﬁcation via Euler characteristic (or Euler
number and hereafter noted EC).
The concepts of percolation and topological quantiﬁcation are intrinsic-
ally diﬀerent. The former raises the question of the existence of a percol-
ating cluster of the size of the system whereas the latter is a measure of
the connectivity. But, without exactly knowing why, it has been observed
many times in the continuum case that the topological information carried
by the EC is linked with percolation ([15, 14, 18]), the critical behaviour
taking place when it changes sign. However, in other kind of systems such
as lattices, diﬀerences can occur between critical probability predicted with
percolation theory and its topological estimation [17, 16]. In addition, the
present work investigates ﬁnite systems for which the phenomenon is less un-
derstood. Thus, to avoid confusion, it is knowingly assumed by the authors
that, in the present context, topological measure predicts percolation. Ana-
lysis of the link between both is out of the scope of this article but, it is the
authors point of view that the strong similitudes between their results and
known percolation probabilities (namely pc = 1/2 in 2D [27] and pc ≈0.16
in 3D [23]) justify further investigations with, for example, Monte-Carlo nu-
merical simulations.
Hence a relation can be made between excursion sets and the percola-
tion probability, using a theoretical framework. In the early nineties, it has
been highlighted by [30] and [19], and they deduce a critical volume fraction
for inﬁnite size problems analytically. We propose to follow the same path
adding some bound corrections introduced by [32], aptly representing ﬁnite
size domains. To the authors knowledge, no analytical solution is known for
these problems, leading to an expensive need of numerical resources when
trying to evaluate percolation probability.
The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the essential
ingredients we use in terms of RFs and excursion sets.
The attention is
drawn on the expectation of the EC. Section 3 then turns to the evaluation
of percolation probabilities over bounded regions in 3D Euclidean space.
Section 4 shows how those results may lead to a new deﬁnition of the so-called
Representative Volume Element (RVE), which is a major concept dealing
with heterogeneous materials. Finally, Section 5 extends our result on critical
probabilities for N-dimensional space.

Measures of excursion sets
Excursion sets are the results of a thresholding operation on a correlated RF.
In the present three-dimensional case, if g : M ⊂R3 7→R is such ﬁeld then,
2for a given threshold κ ∈R, the excursion set is deﬁned by:
Es =

x ∈M ⊂R3 | g(x) > κ
	
.
(1)
Obviously, the morphology of the excursion highly depends on the prop-
erties of the underlying RF (marginal distribution, covariance function, . . . )
and the value of the threshold (see Figure 1). However, a probabilistic link
between these parameters and the morphological characteristics of the ex-
cursion is established [1, 2]. Among the diﬀerent measures that can deﬁne
a given morphology [13], here attention is drawn to the volume fraction Φ,
which is a geometrical measure, and the EC χ which is a topological one.
Obviously Φ and χ are Random Variables. Thus the link we invoke is a
probabilistic one, giving the expected values (E{•}) of the two measures as
a function of the excursion parameters.
Figure 1: Excursion sets of a Gaussian RF. From left to right: low threshold
and percolated cluster of empty space (black), intermediate threshold, high
threshold and percolated cluster (black).
Two important aspects are worth noting. First, the excursion set theory
provides the model with a control of the morphologies through the analytical
knowledge of the measures probability. Second, by its predictable aspect, this
theory avoids the need for any actual realisation of the random morphologies
and the numerical resources that it implies.
EC is used here to detect percolation when it changes sign (null values)
[19]. From [2], its expected values are known (see equation (2)). For a Gaus-
sian RF N (0, σ2) of Gaussian covariance function and correlation length lc
and deﬁned over a cube M of size l is given by:

3its tail probability. Full details of the derivation of equation (2) are given
by the authors in [22]. It is worth noting that the asymptotic behaviour
β →∞, which corresponds to inﬁnite domains, lets equation (2) with a
single term that remains proportional to the volume times (κ2 −1)e−κ2 (for
unit variance). This term, introduced by Robert Adler in 1976, is the result
of diﬀerential topology where excursions could not touch the boundaries.
Latter, applying the Integral geometry’s Kinematic Fundamental Formula
on excursions, Keith Worsley could add the three other terms (see [32] for
details). These terms are the so called bound corrections which allow us to
consider ﬁnite size problems.
Volume fraction plays directly the role of the critical volume of percola-
tion Φc and thus the critical probability pc. Indeed, due to the deﬁnition of
excursion sets of equation (1), it is rather straightforward that its expected
value is simply the tail probability:
E{Φ} = F (κ/σ) .
(3)
The simple aspect of equation (3) comes from the absence of spatial in-
formation in the measure of volume fractions. As a function of the threshold,
Φ is monotonically increasing. From 1 for inﬁnity large negative κ to 0 for
inﬁnitely large positive ones. However, the behaviour of the EC equation (2)
is rather more complicated. The next section explains it along with the link
with percolation phenomena. More details on the excursion set theory is out
of the scope of the article. As mentionned in [1, 2], it has to be kept in mind
that this equation still holds for:
1. all Gaussian related distributions,
2. all twice diﬀerentiable RFs with constant second spectral moments,
and with it, the whole framework presented here can easily be adapted.
Interested readers can consult [21, 22].
The authors would like to emphasise the very similar aspect of equa-
tions (2) and (3) with known results on expected values of Minkowski func-
tionals of Boolean models for inﬁnite [14] and ﬁnite [24] domains.

Percolation criterion
The link between percolation and the EC is considered when, for variations
of the threshold, the EC switches signs [14]. As depicted in Figure 2 where
the expected value of the EC of equation (2) is plotted as a function of the
threshold value κ for three diﬀerent length ratios β, most of the time it
occurs two times and represents two diﬀerent percolation states.

value.
Percolation of the excursion at E{χ(κ+
c )} = 0
By considering a high threshold value, the corresponding excursion set
is made of small disconnected components.
As the threshold value
decreases, these components grow and others appear making the EC
increase up to a certain maximum point. It corresponds to the coales-
cence of the biggest components. The critical point of interest κ+
c is
for a threshold value just below the latter states, where the χ is null.
It is stated that at this stage, the excursion set is percolated.
Percolation of the voids E{χ(κ−
c )} = 0
The same reasoning can be made in order to deﬁne the other percol-
ation point. This time, increasing thresholds starting at a very low
value has to be considered. The percolation point κ−
c is also for the
ﬁrst null value of the EC and corresponds to the percolation of the
voids.
It can be noted in Figure 2 that, for some values of β, percolation can-
not be deﬁned (β = 2 for example). Since the EC is always positive, the
volumes considered are too small to bring any relevant statistical information
in terms of percolation states. This observation can naturally be understood
5by considering the asymptotic case β →0 where equation (2) simply be-
comes the tail probability F of the underlying distribution. In this speciﬁc
case, correlation is inﬁnite compared to domain size, meaning that the RF is
constant leading to excursions without any other topological meaning than
being completely full χ = 1 or completely empty χ = 0. This explains why
the fraction volume and the EC are equivalent. Increasing β brings back the
spatial structure of correlated RF (and with it the diﬀerentiation between
the fraction volume and EC) until the volume is representative enough to
have critical behaviour, e.g. null values of χ. Attention is now drawn to the
corresponding critical volume for percolation:

Even if not taken into account in the notation, the critical volumes of
equation (4) have to be considered as expected values. Figure 3 shows them
both as a function of the length ratio β.

It can be seen that a frontier is created between two states, one with
positive values of χ (outside) and the other with negative values (inside).
As the topology of an excursion can be determined whether it is inside or
outside, this graph can be seen as a ﬁnite size approximation of a phase
6diagram. The fact that the two curves go away from their asymptotic values
and ﬁnally meet is a direct representation of side eﬀects analytically taken
into account by the bound corrections present in equation (2) [32]. It is this
feature that grants to the model the possibility to predict percolation over
bounded regions.
The asymptotic values of Figure 3 can easily be calculated. Indeed, when
β →∞, the two roots of equation (3) are κ+
c = σ and κ−
c = −σ. Injecting
them in equation (3) the two critical volumes:

c = F(1) = 0.1584 . . .
(5)
and
lim
β→∞Φ−
c = F(−1) = 0.8413 . . .
(6)
Furthermore, from the properties of the tail probability function in this
case, the symmetry between void and excursion percolation is proven by the
fact that:
lim
β→∞Φ+
c = 1 −lim
β→∞Φ−
c .
(7)
These results are consistent with some values from the literature obtained
ﬁrst by computer simulations of the potential model (0.17 ± 0.01 in [25]) or
by speculation on lattice problems (0.16 ± 0.02 in [34]). They are also con-
sistent with the symmetrical assumption Φ+
c + Φ−
c = 1. However, based on
numerical simulations [6, 20] or analytical approximations [33], three dimen-
sional continuum models are often based on overlapping ideal geometrical
objects (sphere, ellipsoids, squares, . . . ) leading to a signiﬁcant variation of
the results (see [35] for a more in-depth analysis).
Now, still in Figure 3, as β decreases, the critical volume fraction of the
excursion set Φ+
c increases. It agrees with remarks made in [20] stating that
simulations in larger domains lead to smaller results. This rather unintuitive
feature can be interpreted by the fact that, in a ﬁnite size domain, there are
less possible paths to link two distant points than in an inﬁnite one. Hence,
a higher volume fraction is needed. Table 1 shows some approximations of
Φ+
c and Φ−
c .

First, it can be observed that the present prediction model possesses a
limitation for small scales (β < βlim with βlim ≈2.7766 see table 1) where
7no percolation can be deﬁned. As mentioned in the previous section, it cor-
responds to an absence of root in the EC function. Then, table 1 shows that
for ﬁnite size domains we observe the loose of the symmetrical relationship
Φ+
c + Φ−
c ≥1, meaning that the symmetry hypothesis (that exists on in-
ﬁnite size problems) does not apply anymore. Finally, when looking at the
variation of the critical volumes as a function of the scales, it can be seen
that the side eﬀects play a signiﬁcant role for rather small scales. Actually,
as a ﬁrst part of next section, a quantiﬁcation of the contribution of side
eﬀects leads to the deﬁnition of morphological RVE for percolation. Then
an extension of the predictive model is made for N-dimensional spaces.

Possible extensions
4.1
Percolation Representative Volume Elements
Dealing with heterogeneous media, traditional approaches to deﬁne RVE are
based upon a set of realisations and an averaging procedure. Theoretically,
if the domain M is a RVE for a given property, the discrepancy of the results
must vanish to zero. However, these RVE are usually too large to be handled
numerically. Smaller realisations are thus made and from average values over
all the realisations, lower and upper bounds can be deﬁned [10, 9]. Herein,
this statistical approach is embedded in the theoretical framework that gives
the excursion set expected characteristics. Hence, no actual realisation is
computed.
Due to its monotonic shape, the RVE is deﬁned in regards to the critical
volumes of percolation of excursion set (now noted Φc instead of Φ+
c ), the
“reference” value being the asymptotic value on inﬁnite domains:
Φ∞
c = lim
β→∞Φc.
(8)
The relative error
ǫ = Φc −Φ∞
c
Φ∞
c
(9)
gives the RVE precision. Hence, a value of β can be associated to a given
error. Table 2 shows that, for a given heterogeneity size lc, a region of size
larger than 80 times lc is needed for ǫ = 0.05 and 400 times for ǫ = 0.01.
As far as the authors can tell, no RVE for percolation can be found in
the literature. However, it can be compared to classical mechanical problems
linked with percolation issues such as diﬀusivity phenomena or permeation
in cement paste. On these matters, results are rather consistent and tend
to deﬁne RVE corresponding to a scale ratio of β = 100. Among the vast
literature on that subject, in [36] the authors deﬁne a cement paste RVE for
water diﬀusivity of 100 µm3 with heterogeneities represented by polydisperse

spheres from 1 µm to 50 µm. The RVE is then smaller than what we pre-
dict. Several considerations can explain this diﬀerence. First, the property of
interest diﬀers. When the latter RVE is based on mechanical property (dif-
fusivity), the theoretical approach suggested in this article only takes into
consideration the topological aspect of the morphology. Secondly, a size dis-
tribution of spheres is compared to an excursion set with one characteristic
length only.
4.2
N-dimensional percolation
As presented in the previous sections, equations (2) and (3) link the mar-
ginal distribution of the RF and its spatial structure to the geometrical and
topological characteristics of the excursion. Such theoretical results come
from [29, 28] in a rather more general aspect than presented in the paper. It
is especially valid for RF (and thus, excursions) deﬁned over N-dimensional
spaces.
In such space, any morphology can be characterised by N + 1 independ-
ant mathematical measures ([8, 4]). In the present case, the base made of the
N + 1 Lipschitz-Killing curvatures Lj is used [2]. As a measure of Euclidean
spaces and ignoring a factor of scale, they are equivalent to the more com-
monly used Minkowski functionals and can be seen as j-dimensional sizes.
For example, for an N dimensional hypercube CN = ΠN
i=1[0 a], they read
Lj(CN) =
 N
j

aj, for j = [0..N]. In 3D they will represent the volume,
half of the surface, twice the calliper diameter and the EC, for j = 3, 2, 1
and 0, respectively.
As before, the necessary conditions for the RF is to be twice diﬀeren-
tiable and have a constant second moment.
Now, let g : M ⊂RN 7→
R be a Gaussian RF and λ2 be its second spectral moment.
If Es =

x ∈M ⊂RN | g(x) > κ
	
is the corresponding excursion set, expectation of
the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures can be computed, for j = [0..N], as follows

9where ωj = πN/2/Γ(1+N/2) are the jth volume of the unit ball and, carrying
the information of the RF distribution, Mγ
i are the ith Gaussian Minkowski
functionals1. It is worth noting that only the latter fonctionnals depend on
the threshold κ (see appendix A for their analytical deﬁnitions and [21, 22] for
more general cases). The EC is the “0th” topological measure χ = L0(Es),
whereas the equivalent of the fraction volume is the speciﬁc N th measure
Φ = LN(Es)/LN(M).
With this generalisation of equations (2) and (3), the same methodology
as in section 3 can be applied for any N. It is in this spirit that Figure 4
draws the critical volumes for percolation (for N = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10). The
critical volumes are now deﬁned for percolation of the excursion. Thus Φc =
E{Φ(κ+
c )}, with κ+
c being the larger root of the expected EC.

Accordingly to the literature for inﬁnitely large domains and extended
to all scale ratio, the critical volumes decrease along with increasing spatial
dimensions. Furthermore, increasing spatial dimensions lead to larger RVE
(see section 4.1). In other terms, the asymptotic behaviour is obtained for
larger domains. However, it has to be kept in mind that Figure 4 draws

c . As
noticed in [30], in N dimensional inﬁnite spaces the EC has N −1 roots cor-
responding to N diﬀerent “states” of percolation and N −1 transition times
(the EC roots).
In two dimensions there is one transition time between
two states, namely when it changes, for increasing thresholds, from a per-
colated excursion and non percolated voids to a non percolated excursion
and percolated voids. In three dimensions two transitions occur: ﬁrst from
a percolated excursion and non percolated voids (closed porosity type of
morphology) to percolated excursion and voids (open porosity type of mor-
phology) and second from the latter state to a non percolated excursion to
percolated voids (connected components type of morphology). Since it goes
beyond the standard deﬁnitions it is not clear to us what the other states
mean in higher dimensions. We think that, as three dimensional topological
entities (handles) allows us to yield additional percolation states compare to
the two dimensional case, higher topological entities can produce the same
eﬀect. However, it is because we consider only the higher EC root that we
assume it detects the percolation of the excursion.
Finally attention is drawn to the asymptotic behaviour of the critical
volumes for very large domains. For that matter, Figure 5 shows Φ∞
c
as
deﬁned in equation (8) as a function of N.
As it was already noticeable in Figure 4, it can be seen in Figure 5 that,
for N = 2, the critical percolation probability of bond lattices pc = 1/2
[12] is retrieved. However, going further in dimensions increase drastically
the diﬀerence between the models.
Comparison is made here, ﬁrst with
results from [31] where percolation threshold ηc represents the total speciﬁc
volume of overlapping hyperspheres. For the sake of comparison, the data
drawn are the equivalent critical volume Φc = 1 −e−ηc. Then comparison is
made with bond percolation probability pc on lattice from [7]. The diﬀerence
between these results comes from the rather diﬀerent physical natures of the
models and even the deﬁnition of percolation.
However, the tendency of
smaller critical percolation probability with higher dimension seems to be
conﬁrmed.

Concluding remarks
We propose an analytical model that determines the critical probability of
percolation over bounded regions in N-dimensional Euclidean space through
topological estimation. It is based on the probabilistic knowledge of measures
of excursion sets based on correlated RF. First, the EC is used to detect per-
colation through its null values and then, the corresponding N-dimensional
volume fraction is the so called critical volume Φc that links the continuum
aspect of excursions and the well known critical probability pc.
Analysis have mainly been made through 3D examples. The model is

able to retrieve results of the literature such as the critical volume Φc ≈0.16
for inﬁnite regions. But, more importantly, since the model can predict per-
colation for bounded regions the percolation probability is considered as a
function of a scale ratio (or domain size) and the results stated just above
are their asymptotic values. This feature is used in a concrete example where
statistically Representative Volume Elements for percolation have been ana-
lytically determined.
An extension to N-dimensional spaces is proposed,
showing the general aspect of this analytical framework. However, in oppos-
ition to other frameworks, this model does not provide information on the
subcritical and supercritical behaviour.
Several lines of investigation can come out from these results. For ex-
ample, an analysis between topological prediction and the critical behaviours
in the case of excursion sets can be made with Monte-Carlo simulations in
order to see how well does the EC predict continuum percolation. Another
fruitful way is to compare the present approach with average concentrations
of spanning clusters from ﬁnite-size scaling frameworks (see chapter 4.1 of
[26]) where impact of the size of the observation window can be analysed.

Gaussian Minkowski functionnals
By explaining how the Minkowski functionnals are linked with the probab-
ility of the Random Field to be greater than the threshold g(x) > κ, or
in other words, the probability of the Random Field to be in the so-called
hitting set g(x) ∈[κ, ∞[, this appendix gives the analytical deﬁnition of the
Gaussian Minkowski functionnals Mγ
i in equation (10).
A.1
Taylor expansion of the tube Gaussian volumes
In contrast to Lipschitz-killing curvatures, the Minkowski functionals are not
intrinsic. Therefore, they depend on the measure asociated to it. Herein, the
measure of a Gaussian distribution is of concern. Let γk be such a measure
in the Euclidean space Rk. If X = {Xi} is a standard Gaussian vector of
size k in which Xi ∼N (0, σ2), i = [1..k] are independent and A ⊂Rk:
γk(A) = P {X ∈A} =
1
σk(2π)k/2

e−∥x∥2/2σ2dx.
(11)
Associated to this measure, the functionals are now called Gaussian Minkowski
functionals (hereafter GMFs). In a k-dimensional space, k + 1 GMFs are
deﬁned, noted Mγk
j , j = [0..N]. The main results of [28] is to yield the
following Taylor expansion of tube probability:
γk(K(A, ρ)) =
∞

(12)
for small enough ρ, where K(A, ρ) is the tube of A of ray ρ.
It can be
seen as an extension of the Steiner-Weyls formula, in which γk represents
the volume in the sense of Gaussian measure (Gaussian volume). By taking
ρ = 0, it can be concluded that the ﬁrst Gaussian Minkowski functional is
the Gaussian volume of A itself, Mγk
0 (A) = γk(A). Other GMFs can be
identiﬁed in speciﬁc cases.
A.2
Application to scalar-valued Gaussian Random Fields
Even though the presented formulae work for more general cases, it suﬃces
in this case to take k = 1, corresponding to scalar-valued RF g : R3 →R
and excursion sets deﬁned as:

It leads to several simpliﬁcations. First, the Gaussian volume of the hit-
ting set [κ, ∞[ is the complementary cumulative density function (or tail
distribution, noted F) of the underlying standard distribution:
γ1([κ, ∞[) = P {X ≥κ} =
1
σ
√
2π
Z ∞
κ
e−x2/σ2dx = F(κ),
(13)
13furthermore, the tube of [κ, ∞[ can easily be deﬁned and its tail probability
linked to the tail distribution as follows:
K([κ, ∞[, ρ) = [κ −ρ, ∞[ and γ1([κ −ρ, ∞[) = F(κ −ρ).
(14)
Each GMFs of (12) can be identiﬁed by the unique standard Taylor expansion
of F(κ −ρ) for small ρ, leading to:
for j = 0, Mγ1
0 ([κ, ∞[) = F(κ),
(15a)
for j ≥1, Mγ1
j ([κ, ∞[) = (−1)j dj F(κ)
dκj
= e−κ2/2σ2
σj√
2π Hj−1 (κ/σ) ,
(15b)
where Hj, j ≥0 are the jth probabilist Hermite polynomials:
Hn(x) = (−1)n ex2/2 dn
dxn e−x2/2.
More general results can be ﬁnd in [21].
