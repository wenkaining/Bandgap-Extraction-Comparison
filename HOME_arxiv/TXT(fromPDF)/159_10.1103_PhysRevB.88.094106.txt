Hydrogenated graphene edges are assumed to be either armchair, zigzag or a combination of
the two. We show that the zigzag is not the most stable fully hydrogenated edge structure along
the <2¯1¯10> direction. Instead hydrogenated Klein and reconstructed Klein based edges are found
to be energetically more favourable, with stabilities approaching that of armchair edges.
These
new structures ‘unify’ graphene edge topology, the most stable ﬂat hydrogenated graphene edges
always consisting of pairwise bonded C2H4 edge groups, irrespective the edge orientation. When
edge rippling is included, CH3 edge groups are most stable.
These new fundamental hydrogen
terminated edges have important implications for graphene edge imaging and spectroscopy, as well
as mechanisms for graphene growth, nanotube cutting, and nanoribbon formation and behaviour.

Graphene edges have been studied intensively since the
ﬁrst interest in graphitic nanomaterials and graphene1–9.
As recently shown, the precise edge termination of
graphene nanoribbons and ﬂakes has a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the material properties10–13.
The graphene honey-
comb lattice can be cut along two primary directions, the
<1¯100> and the <2¯1¯10>, creating so-called armchair
and zigzag/Klein edges respectively (see Fig.1).
All
intermediate orientations can be described in terms
of alternating sections of these edge orientations14, in
general called chiral edges.
The armchair edge along the <1¯100> direction is the
most stable unreconstructed suspended graphene edge,
both unterminated7,15 and hydrogenated with each edge
carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms6,7.
The <2¯1¯10> direction is more complex.
Unlike the
<1¯100> direction, there exist two possibilities to termi-

nate the graphene lattice parallel to the <2¯1¯10> direc-
tion (see Fig.1 (b)), resulting in either the classic zigzag
edge, or the Klein edge with only single neighbour edge
carbon atoms16,17.
The largely ignored unterminated
pristine Klein edge is highly unstable and can undergo
pairwise reconstruction to a pentagon-terminated Klein
edge15.
This reconstructed edge nonetheless remains
+0.4 eV/˚A less stable than unterminated armchair or
(5-7) reconstructed zigzag edges7,15.
Further
complexity arises for <2¯1¯10>
edges when
hydrogen terminated.
Recent modelling has shown
that
the
singly
hydrogenated
zigzag
edge
can
be
stabilised through adding a period three hydrogen
pair-termination, the z211 edge6, with the resulting edge
no longer magnetic18. The z211 zigzag edge is to date
the most stable <2¯1¯10> edge structure proposed in the
literature.
This general focus on zigzag and armchair
graphene edges means that there has been no discussion
of hydrogenated Klein-based edge conﬁgurations so far.
We describe in this communication for the ﬁrst time
a study, based on density functional calculations, of
hydrogen terminated Klein and reconstructed Klein
edge conﬁgurations.
Furthermore hydrogenated edge
mixtures of reconstructed Klein and zigzag edge sections
along the <2¯1¯10> direction are explored.
These new
edge structures are signiﬁcantly more stable than hydro-
gen terminated zigzag edges.
Spin polarised density functional calculations under
the local density approximation were performed as
implemented in the AIMPRO code19–21.
The charge
density is ﬁtted to plane waves with an energy cut-oﬀ
of 150 Ha (Ha: Hartree energy). Electronic level occu-
pation was obtained using a Fermi occupation function
with kT = 0.04 eV. Relativistic pseudo-potentials are
generated
using
the
Hartwingster-Goedecker-Hutter2
scheme22, resulting in basis sets of 22 independent
Gaussian functions for carbon and 12 for hydrogen.
All calculations were performed using orthorhombic
supercells, whose sizes have been checked and chosen
to be suﬃciently large to avoid interaction between
neighbouring ribbons (vacuum distance between ribbons
larger than 15 ˚A). A ﬁne k-point grid was chosen
(armchair GNR: (12/N) × 1 × 1 and zigzag GNR:
(18/N) × 1 × 1, where N is the number of fundamental
unit cells along the ribbon axis). Energies are converged
to better than 10−7 Ha.
Atomic positions and lattice
parameters were geometrically optimised until the maxi-
mum atomic position change in a given iteration dropped
below 10−5 a0 (a0: Bohr radius). Molecular dynamics
calculations were performed with the self-consistent-
charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB)
Hamiltonian23 implemented in the DFTB+ code24. We
run NVT Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using
an Andersen thermostat with a re-selection probability
of 0.2 and a time-step of 1 fs.
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) of width ∼50 ˚A have
been used to model decoupled hydrogen terminated
graphene edges. Ribbon segments in one unit cell consist
of nC carbon atoms and nH hydrogen atoms. The edge
formation energy Eedge6,15 is then calculated using:
Eedge = Eribbon −nC · EC −nH ·
EH2
2
2L
.
(1)
Here, Eribbon is the total internal energy of the nanorib-
bon segment in a unit cell.
L is the length along
the ribbon axis of the repeated nanoribbon segment
(schematically indicated with blue bars in Fig.2 and 3),
with two similar opposed graphene hydrogenated edge
conﬁgurations.
EC is the energy of a carbon atom in
a perfect graphene sheet, EH2 gives the total internal
energy of an isolated H2 molecule.
Although several edge formation energies are found to
be negative, this does not necessarily indicate the system
favours edge formation over the bulk state under ex-
perimental conditions. Full free energy diﬀerences must
be considered to address this, including entropy change
and chemical potential of the edge components. Even if
edge formation is thermodynamically favoured, reaction
barriers may be prohibitive. Edge formation energies for
armchair and zigzag edges are comparable with those in
the literature6,7,18,25, with small quantitative diﬀerences
due to choice of exchange correlation functional (for
more details see Supplementary Materials26).
A nomenclature to diﬀerentiate the various hydro-
genated edge conﬁgurations is used similar to Wassmann
et.
al.6, extended by the Klein and the reconstructed
Klein edge (a: armchair, z: zigzag, k: Klein and rk:
reconstructed Klein).
Subscripts indicate the num-
ber of hydrogen atoms bonded to every edge carbon
atom along the periodic edge segment.
The new su-
perscripts u (“up”) and d (“down”) indicate, where
needed, out-of-plane edge deformations (edge rippling)12.
The edge conﬁgurations rk11 (+0.302 eV/˚A), rk21
(+0.134 eV/˚A) and rk22 + k2 (+0.034 eV/˚A) are all
unstable, similar to the singly hydrogenated zigzag edge
z1 (+0.105 eV/˚A) (see also Supplementary Materials26).
However, the hydrogenated reconstructed Klein edge
rk22 is energetically stable with an edge formation
energy of −0.030 eV/˚A (see Fig.2 (a)). Notably the new
hydrogenated rk22 edge conﬁguration is more than twice
as stable as the most stable hydrogen terminated zigzag
edge (z211, −0.016 eV/˚A, Fig.2 (d)), unequivocally
proving that the most stable hydrogenated <2¯1¯10>
oriented edges are not zigzag, but reconstructed Klein
based.
The ground state for the reconstructed Klein edge rk22
is magnetic (0.120 µB/˚A), similar to the z1 edge (0.128
µB/˚A). Intra-edge states couple ferromagnetically, while
inter-edge coupling18,27–29 is excluded here due to the
large ribbon width. Magnetic zigzag edge states vanish
with local defects or variations in hydrogen density (e.g.
the z211 edge18). The perfect rk22 edge should protect
the magnetic behaviour. We note that a stable magnetic
(edge) state is an important property for graphene use
in spintronics30.
Just as the z1 zigzag edge can be stabilised by
periodically inserting double hydrogenation (z211), so
can the rk22 edge via periodic insertion of a Klein edge
vacancy, i.e.
a double hydrogenated zigzag edge site
z2.
The resulting rk22 + z2 edge has an edge forma-
tion energy of -0.107 eV/˚A
(Fig.2 (b)), approaching
that of fully hydrogenated armchair edges with -0.186
eV/˚A (Fig.2 (c)). As for the z211 edge this increased
stability comes through the removal of the edge states
around the Fermi level, resulting in a non-magnetic edge.
As expected,
most hydrogenated unreconstructed
Klein edges are thermodynamically unstable (k1 (+1.276
eV/˚A), k2 (+0.476 eV/˚A), k32 (+0.052 eV/˚A) and kud
332
(+0.490 eV/˚A), see also Supplementary Materials26).
However the fully hydrogenated Klein edge kud
33 is very
stable (-0.150 eV/˚A, see Fig.3).
Here the Klein edge
carbon atoms are methylated giving CH3, decoupling
them from the sp2 bonded graphene π-system.
This
stability is only possible with periodic out-of-plane
displacement of the edge methyl groups, relieving strain
induced by inter-methyl steric hindrance12,31.
As for the zigzag and reconstructed Klein edges, the kud
33
can be further stabilised through periodically inserting
a Klein vacancy kud
33 + z2 (-0.191 eV/˚A), as shown in
Fig.3 (b). This results in a non-magnetic conﬁguration
with a slightly reduced out-of-plane rippling amplitude.
All three edge types (z211, kud
22 + z2 and kud
33 + z2) then
show periodic sp2 −sp2 −sp3 bonding along their zigzag
backbone.
We note that on metal surfaces, rippled
fully hydrogenated Klein edges are likely to become less
stable.
Dehydrogenation is also facilitated32–34, and
dehydrogenated CH3 edge groups could reconstruct to3

rk22 edges.
The calculations presented thus far consider perfect
vacuum conditions around free standing graphene edges.
A legitimate question arises, namely, what could be ex-
pected in experiments? In order to consider a molecular
hydrogen gas atmosphere around the graphene edge, the
calculated total edge formation energy Eedge can be com-
pared to the hydrogen chemical potential µH2, resulting
in the relative edge stability
GH2 = Eedge −ρH · µH2/2 .
(2)
Here, ρH = nH
2L gives the hydrogen edge density, with nH
the number of hydrogen atoms attached to a graphene
ribbon segment of length L. The hydrogen chemical po-
tential µH2 depends on the pressure and temperature of
the system6. As an indication, at ambient conditions the
chemical potential µH2 at 300 K and partial H2 pressure
in air of PH2 ≈5 · 10−4 mbar gives µH2 ≈−0.4 eV35.
For both, decreasing PH2 and increasing temperatures,
the chemical potential decreases.
In Fig.4, GH2 is calculated over a realistic range
of µH2, for the primary hydrogenated <2¯1¯10> edges,
identifying regimes of diﬀerent stable edge types. For low
hydrogen chemical potentials the zigzag hydrogenated
edges dominate. However, for higher pressures and/or
moderate growth temperatures the new rk22 + z2 and4

33 + z2 conﬁgurations become favourable, starting
around µH2 ≥−0.7 eV. Up to µH2 = −0.4 eV several
diﬀerent hydrogenated edge conﬁgurations are very close
in energy, thermodynamically dominated by the new
most stable identiﬁed Klein and reconstructed Klein
conﬁgurations. Such low temperature and higher pres-
sure conditions (µH2 ≈−1.2 to −0.5 eV) are currently of
interest for cost eﬃcient CVD graphene growth on metal
surfaces36–39.
Given the close proximity in stability
of these edge structures under typical CVD growth
conditions, many of them may occur during growth.
Possible growth mechanisms based on carbon dimers
(C2) as fundamental building blocks are proposed in
Fig.5.

These could provide
an explanation for observed kinetic growth barriers
on metal surfaces tentatively associated with graphene
lattice construction38.
Such edges could also form when tailoring graphene
sheets40,41 or unzipping carbon nanotubes42,43.
An
armchair nanotube can be opened along its axis giving
a nanoribbon with either zigzag or reconstructed Klein
edges depending on the cutting line (see Fig.6). Under
vacuum conditions the zigzag terminated ribbon is
0.32-0.82 eV/˚A
more stable than the reconstructed
Klein. However with hydrogen present the reconstructed
Klein terminated ribbon is 0.03-0.36 eV/˚A more stable
than the zigzag, the precise energy diﬀerence depending
on the edge conﬁgurations26.
To better explore the edge structures that can form
during tube unzipping under experimentally relevant
conditions, we next simulated pyrrolidine functionalized
CNTs, since they have been found to unzip in vacuum44.
A pyrrolidine group is formed when an azomethine
ylide (CH2NHCH2) bonds to two C atoms of the
tube45. We modelled a 3 nm long (5,5) carbon nanotube
functionalized with 12 pyrrolidine groups perpendicular
to the tube axis (Fig.7 (a)). The number and position
of the functional groups was chosen to promote the
unzipping. Fig.7(a) shows the starting structure, which
is then heated to 2000 K. After 50 ps the nanotube
is fully unzipped Fig.7(b).
A few atoms no longer
chemically bonded to the tube are taken out of the
simulation. The system is then relaxed and run for 20
ps more to produce the ﬁnal ﬂat nanoribbon structure,
Fig.7 (c).
Of the 24 unzipped C atoms at the new
boundaries, 19 show Klein edges (4 reconstructed) of
which 10 C atoms have sp3 character. A variety of Klein-
related edge units can be observed along the unzipping
line, including rk22, k2 and k3 species.
Thus these
simulations suggest that Klein-based edge formation
during pyrrolidine unzipping of carbon nanotubes occurs.

presented here allow us to create a uniﬁed picture of
hydrogenated graphene edges.
Formation energies for
hydrogenated <1¯100> armchair and <2¯1¯10> recon-
structed Klein edges are similar, with both containing
C2H4 motifs (see Fig.8). It is easy to imagine intermedi-
ate chiral edges constructed similarly. For example chiral
periodic edges observed experimentally from unzipped
carbon nanotubes46 appear to bear some similarity to
such structures, often using intermediate temperature
(∼300◦C) H2 plasma treatment to clean the graphene
edges47.
Reconstructed Klein edges may be diﬃcult to observe
experimentally.
High resolution electron microscopy
studies will rapidly detach edge hydrogen, rendering the
reconstructed Klein edge unstable. Scanning tunnelling
microscopy experiments under relatively low voltage
bias are likely to observe a zigzag type edge.
This is
because the C2H4 reconstructed Klein edge groups are
sp3 coordinated with deeper electronic states, and hence
will appear dark at voltage biases suﬃcient to image the
π-bonded sp2 carbon basal plane network.
Although the DFT calculations presented here concern
only hydrogenation of graphene edges we anticipate a
qualitatively similar stability of <2¯1¯10> reconstructed
Klein edges with diﬀerent edge functional groups12,13.
In summary, we show here that the most stable
hydrogenated graphene edges along <2¯1¯10> are not
the previously reported zigzag edge structures, but
instead reconstructed Klein edge structures (rk22 and
rk22 + z2).
The stability of these edges and their
derivatives approaches that of hydrogenated armchair
edges.
Edge methylation stabilises edges still further,
but only under the condition that the edge groups can
undergo signiﬁcant out-of-plane edge rippling.
The
new stable hydrogenated edge types are predicted to
occur under experimentally attainable conditions, as
demonstrated via molecular dynamics simulations of
pyrrolidine promoted unzipping of carbon nanotubes.
The most stable edge structures are all non-magnetic.
It will be important to revisit previous experimental
studies, notably on graphene nanoribbon production, in
light of these new edge types.
