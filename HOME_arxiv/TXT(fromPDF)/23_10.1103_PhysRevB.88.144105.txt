We investigate the low temperature structural and electronic properties of the type-I clathrate
Eu8Ga16Ge30 under pressure using x-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD), x-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) techniques. The XRD mea-
surements reveal a transition to an amorphous phase above 18 GPa. Unlike previous reports on
other clathrate compounds, no volume-collapse is observed prior to the crystalline-amorphous phase
transition which takes place when the unit cell volume is reduced to 81% of its ambient pressure
value. Fits of the pressure-dependent relative volume to a Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) yield
a bulk modulus B0 = 65 ± 3 GPa and a pressure derivative B′
0 = 3.3 ± 0.5. The Eu L2-edge XMCD
data shows quenching of the magnetic order at the crystalline-amorphous phase transition. The
XANES spectra indicate the persistence of Eu2+ valency state up to 22 GPa, therefore the sup-
pression of XMCD intensity is due to the loss of magnetic order as a result of frustrated exchange
interactions in the amorphous phase, and not due to quenching of local moments. When compared
with other clathrates, the results point to the importance of guest ion-cage interactions in determin-
ing the mechanical stability of the framework structure and the critical pressure for amorphization.
Finally, the crystalline structure is not found to recover after pressure release, resulting in a novel
amorphous material that is at least metastable at ambient pressure and temperature.

INTRODUCTION
Materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties are
needed fueled partly by new developments in energy con-
version from nanoscale and nanostructured thermoelec-
tric materials.1 The thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit of
materials is quantiﬁed by their dimensionless quantity
ZT = S2T/(κρ), where S, T , ρ and κ are the Seebeck co-
eﬃcient, temperature, electrical resistivity and the ther-
mal conductivity, respectively.2,3 Signiﬁcant eﬀort has
been directed at investigating complex intermetallic ma-
terials based on groups IV and V elements, due to their
ability to form guest/host cage structures with enhanced
phonon scattering, and consequent low thermal conduc-
tivity. Two representative families are the ﬁlled skutteru-
dite compounds with general formula RM4X12 and the
type-I clathrate compounds with general formula A8X46,
in which host cages made of various combinations of X
atoms from the aforementioned element groups are ﬁlled
by R or A guest ions such as rare earth and alkaline
earth elements.
In addition to the extensively investi-
gated enhanced thermoelectric properties4,5 these mate-
rials also display a myriad of complex phenomena, such
as superconductivity,6 metal-insulator transitions,7 mag-
netic ordering,5,8,9 Kondo insulator eﬀects10 and heavy
fermion behavior.11–14
Among the type-I clathrates, Eu8Ga16Ge30 is one of
the most investigated and unique in that it presents
full ﬁlling of the host cages with a rare earth ele-
ment.
This compound has potential in thermoelec-
tric applications due to its behavior approaching the
“phonon glass, electron crystal” (PGEC) concept.15
In addition, Eu8Ga16Ge30 shows a variety of interest-
ing properties such as anharmonic vibration of the Eu
ions,16–20 ferromagnetic ordering4,5 with Curie tempera-
ture TC ∼35 K, multiple (and as yet unresolved) mag-
netic structures below T ∗∼23 K,21–23 enhanced magne-
tocaloric eﬀect,23–25 development of magnetic polarons26
and structural dimorphism.5,27,28
In its type-I clathrate phase, Eu8Ga16Ge30 displays a
cubic structure within the Pm3n space group (No. 223).
The unit cell presents two types of cages: six in the shape
of tetrakaidecahedrons (X24) and two smaller dodecahe-
dral (X20) ones (Figure 1(a)).
The cages are formed
by Ga and Ge ions distributed among the nonequiva-
lent crystallographic sites 6c, 16i and 24k.4,20 There is
evidence that the Ga and Ge ions distribution is not en-
tirely random, since the Ga ions preferentially occupy the
6c and avoid the 16i Wyckoﬀposition.29,30
Inside the smaller X20 polyhedron the Eu atom is
hosted at the center of the cage (2a Wyckoﬀposition).
On the other hand, the Eu ions inside the larger cages rat-
tle among four equivalent oﬀ-center positions (24k crys-
tallographic sites) (Figure 1(b) and (c)).4,5,20,21 This rat-
tling motion is of signiﬁcant interest for the material’s
thermoelectric properties and it has been one of the main
drivers behind investigations of this and other clathrate
compounds.
Many of the clathrates physical properties are reg-
ulated by the guest-cage interaction and their relative
sizes. Thus, applying pressure is a clean method to mod-
ify the guest-host interactions, and potentially tune these2

properties.
Such eﬀect is evident by the wide variety
of new crystallographic, electronic and magnetic behav-
iors observed in these materials at high pressure. For in-
stance, a polycrystalline Sr8Ga16Ge30 sample with rather
poor ambient pressure ZT had its value strongly en-
hanced at 7 GPa.31 The improved ZT under pressure
provides further valuable insight towards application-
oriented design of thermoelectric materials. The isostruc-
tural compound Ba8Ga16Ge30 was also investigated un-
der pressure by x-ray diﬀraction and Raman spectroscopy
up to 40 GPa,32 through which a volume-collapse and
anomalies in the spectral features were observed. This
is consistent with several type-I clathrates studied under
pressure exhibiting volume-collapse followed by a crys-
talline to amorphous transition at high pressure.32–37
Previous works on the Eu8Ga16Ge30 clathrate under high
pressure used Raman scattering to observe rattling vibra-
tions of the Eu ion up to 6.7 GPa and 202 K,38 and elec-
trical resistivity and Hall coeﬃcient measurements up to
11.4 GPa.39 An slight increase in TC and T ∗as a function
of pressure and a decrease in resistivity as a result of an
increase in carrier concentration were the main ﬁndings
in these works. Consequently, the eﬀect of high pressure
in the electronic and crystallographic structure of this
compound remained elusive.
In this paper we report high pressure x-ray pow-
der diﬀraction (XRD), x-ray absorption near-edge struc-
ture (XANES) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) results on the type-I clathrate Eu8Ga16Ge30
at low temperature, aiming to probe the pressure depen-
dence of the various phenomena displayed by the Eu ions
and the host cages. The data reveal an irreversible amor-
phization of the structure around 18 GPa. In contrast to
other clathrates, no volume-collapse is found preceding
the amorphization. Eu L2 XMCD measurements show
a sharp suppression of ferromagnetic moment in the 16-
20 GPa range commensurate with the structural change.
The absence of an Eu3+ state signature in the XANES
spectra points to the persistence of the 4f 7 local mo-
ment. Furthermore, the linear XMCD hysteresis loops
indicate the loss of ferromagnetic order which, when as-
sociated to the XRD results, points to a pressure-induced
paramagnetic amorphous state. The magnetic signal is
not recovered on pressure release, consistent with an irre-
versible nature of the structural transition, which implies
a novel amorphous phase in this system which is at least
metastable at ambient pressure and temperature.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Single crystals of type-I Eu8Ga16Ge30 were grown at
IFGW/UNICAMP by a Ga self ﬂux method similar
to that previously detailed.40,41 Selected crystals were
ground and sieved through a 635 mesh, resulting in
ﬁne powder with grain sizes ∼10 µm.
The XANES
and XMCD spectra measurements at ambient pressure
were performed in transmission mode with the sam-
ple mounted uniformly on tapes. High-pressure powder
XRD and the XANES/XMCD measurements at ambi-
ent and high pressure were performed at beam lines 16-
BM-D and 4-ID-D, respectively, of the Advanced Photon
Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The XRD mea-
surement was performed at 10 K and 30 K. The pow-
der patterns were collected with an image plate detector
(MAR345) with pixel size of 100 µm placed at 491 mm
from the symmetric diamond anvil cell (DAC) (Prince-
ton shops). The 2D images were integrated to provide
intensity as a function of 2θ using the software FIT2D.42
Due to the DAC limited angular scattering range (∼18
degrees of scattering angle 2θ), the beam was tuned to
29.2 keV in order to detect a signiﬁcant number of Bragg
peaks within this angular range. For the XRD measure-
ments two full diamond anvils with 300 µm culet diam-
eter were used. Re gaskets were pre-indented to 60 µm,
and a 140 µm sample chamber was laser-drilled. He gas
was used as pressure medium.43 Pressure was calibrated
in situ using ruby spheres with ∼5 µm diameter and
a small amount of Au powder as standards.44 The Au
peaks are marked with a * in the diﬀractograms.
High-pressure, low temperature (T = 10 K) XANES
and XMCD measurements were performed in a trans-
mission geometry at the Eu L2 absorption edge (7617
eV).45,46 Some pressure points were measured at the Eu
L3 edge but due to the large number of Bragg reﬂection
glitches in each X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) we
were only able to measure at the Eu L2 edge. A pair of
Si/Pd mirrors was used to focus and collimate the beam.
Harmonic rejection was done both by the reﬂectivity cut
oﬀof the mirrors, and by detuning the double crystal
monochromator. XMCD experiments were performed in
helicity switching mode at 13.1 Hz, and the signal de-
tected with a lock-in ampliﬁer to increase the signal-to-3
noise ratio.47 An external magnetic ﬁeld of H = 0.5 T was
used to align the ferromagnetic domains. Measurements
were repeated for opposite ﬁeld directions to remove
non-magnetic artifacts.
All XANES and XMCD data
were normalized to a jump of 1.0. A membrane-driven
Copper-Beryllium (CuBe) diamond anvil cell (DAC) was
used. Due to large absorption by the diamonds, a par-
tially perforated anvil was opposite to a fully perforated
anvil with a mini anvil on top.45,46 Independent experi-
ments were carried out with culet diameters of 300, 450
and 600 µm. Pressure was calibrated in situ with a ruby
luminescence system,44 and silicone oil was used as pres-
sure medium. Stainless steel gaskets pre-indented to 50-
90 µm were used and the sample chamber drilled with an
electrical discharge machine (EDM).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A.
XRD measurements
Figure 2 shows selected XRD spectra obtained as a
function of pressure at 10 K. No additional peaks or
splittings are observed in the diﬀraction patterns to the
highest pressure, indicating that the structure remains in
the Pm3n space group leading to the amorphization. At
19.8 GPa the sample Bragg peaks completely disappear
and only a broad amorphous halo pattern is observed.
This clearly shows that the type-I clathrate Eu8Ga16Ge30
has a pressure induced crystalline-amorphous transition.
Panel (i) in Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern at 5.4 GPa
after the decompression. XRD patterns were also mea-
sured after pressure release upon warming. The amor-
phous phase is also observed up to room temperature,
indicating that this thermal energy is not suﬃcient to in-
duce a recrystallization. A shift of the high-density amor-
phous pattern to lower 2θ values is observed for higher
pressures. In addition, we have measured the XRD pres-
sure evolution at 30 K (between T ∗and TC) and we ob-
served the same irreversible crystalline-amorphous tran-
sition at ∼18 GPa.
The evolution of the unit cell volume measured
at 10 K normalized to the lowest pressure measured
(V0 ∼1221.3 ˚A3 and P0 ∼1 GPa) is shown in Fig-
ure 3. The XRD measurements performed at 30 K (not
shown here) showed the same pressure dependence and
only a displacement smaller than 0.01 ˚A in the lattice
parameter for each pressure point. In contrast to other
clathrates32,34,36 no volume-collapse leading to the amor-
phization is observed.
The unit cell volume was com-
pressed to about 83% of the volume at 1 GPa at the
onset of amorphization (81% compared to volume at am-
bient pressure). The solid line in Figure 3 is a ﬁt to a
third-order Murnaghan equation of state (EOS).48 This
ﬁt yields a bulk modulus B0 = 65±3 GPa and a pressure
derivative B′
0 = 3.3 ± 0.5 for the Eu8Ga16Ge30 structure.

ing applied pressures. Panel (i) shows the diﬀraction pattern
when the pressure is released after the sample reaches the
crystal-to-amorphous transformation. The ﬁrst three intense
Bragg peaks (around 8 - 9 degrees) correspond to the (222),
(320) and (321) reﬂections, respectively. The peaks marked
with ∗are due to Au powder.

Absorption measurements
The previously reported ambient pressure data for the
clathrate Eu8Ga16Ge30 obtained at Eu L2,3 absorption
edges49 are in agreement with our XANES/XMCD data,
whose normalized spectra measured at T = 10 K and
H = 0.5 T are shown in Figure 4.
The XANES and XMCD pressure evolution for the Eu
L2 edge are shown in Figures 5(a) and (b), respectively.
The L2 XANES spectra are sensitive to the europium ion
valency, such that an additional spectral weight at 8 eV
manifests as the signature of a 3+ component,50–52 yet
no such component is observed in our measured pressure
range. In particular, no 4f 7 →4f 6 transition is detected4

across the amorphization process. A small decrease in the
white-line intensity is observed until the onset of amor-
phization (Figure 5(a)) and it continues across the tran-
sition. The suppressed white-line is not recovered upon
pressure release (Figure 5(a) shows XANES spectrum at
2.0 GPa after releasing the pressure in the cell).
The
XMCD signal as a function of pressure is also displayed
in Figure 5 panel (b). A strong decrease in the XMCD
intensity occurs at higher pressures. Note that ferromag-
netic order is not recovered when the pressure in the cell
is released. The small persistent XMCD signal observed
after amorphization is due to the paramagnetic response
of Eu2+ ions in the applied ﬁeld.

expected position of the Eu3+ features.
The XANES and
XCMD spectra at 2.0 GPa was measured after releasing the
pressure.
Figure 6(a) shows the integrated XMCD signal ob-
tained at T = 10 K and H = 0.5 T as function of
pressure. The XMCD displays a small drop in the in-
tensity around 3 GPa, followed by an increase at 7 GPa.
This small anomaly in the XMCD signal could be related
to a change in the carrier concentration with pressuriza-
tion, as previously hypothesized.39 However, this inten-
sity variation is roughly within the error bars. At higher
pressures the XMCD intensity clearly shows a sharp sup-
pression in the 16-19 GPa range.
The fast reduction
in the XMCD signal matches quite well the concomi-
tant structural changes seen in the XRD measurements,
demonstrating that the crystalline-to-amorphous transi-
tion has an adverse eﬀect on the magnetic ordering in this
compound. In addition, the hysteresis loops for selected
pressures shown in Figure 6(b) reveal that this pressure-
driven transition suppresses the ferromagnetic order. A
transition to an antiferromagnetic phase is unlikely due
to the amorphization of the material and lack of long
range magnetic order. The abrupt XMCD collapse cou-
pled with large hysteresis/irreversibility of structural and
electronic properties indicate that the transition is ﬁrst
order and that the amorphization hampers the long range
magnetic order of Eu8Ga16Ge30 as a result of frustrated
exchange interactions triggered by the structural disor-
der, resulting in a paramagnetic amorphous state.

DISCUSSION
The guest-host interactions are believed to dominate
the physical response in clathrates, hence new properties
are expected to emerge by inducing changes in the inter-
atomic distances.

electronic and magnetic properties of the type-I clathrate
Eu8Ga16Ge30 allow us to determine changes in its ground
state properties under high pressures.
Powder XRD performed at 10 K and 30 K reveal a
crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition at ∼18 GPa
where the unit cell is compressed to ∼81% of the am-
bient pressure volume. The evolution of XRD patterns
as a function of pressure does not show any additional
peaks or splittings characteristic of a change in crystal
symmetry, as can be seen in Figure 2. A possible change
in the crystallographic site of the Eu ion inside the large
cage, from 6d to 24k would be visible by a change in
intensities ratios of some intense Bragg peaks (such as
the (222), (320) and (321) in Figure 2(a)). Such eﬀect
was not observed, suggesting that the Eu ion remains
oﬀ-center (24k site) in the entire pressure range.
The
powder patterns only reveal a reduction of intensity and
a shift of the peaks to low angle due to the lattice com-
pression. The existence of an oﬀ-center position of the
Eu ion inside the larger cage, compatible with rattling
phenomena, is in line with the observation of T ∗up to
at least 11.4 GPa by resistivity measurements.39

for
diﬀerent
clathrate compounds are summarized in Table IV. Com-
pared to other type-I clathrates investigated under pres-
sure, Eu8Ga16Ge30 shows the lowest threshold pres-
sure to reach the amorphous phase.
Nevertheless, its
amorphization pressure is similar to those of type-III
clathrates such as Ba24Ge100 (Pa
=
20 GPa) and
Ba24Si100 (Pa = 23 GPa).53 Such similar threshold is
likely related to the presence of open cages and weak
guest-host interaction observed in these cases.

Typical
type-I
clathrate
compounds
such
as
Ba8Ga16Ge30
and
those with
the framework com-
posed of Si atoms such as Ba8Si46 and Rb6.15Si46
show a transition to an amorphous phase at pressures
higher than 33 GPa, despite all compounds having
similar lattice parameters at ambient pressure.
The
clathrate Sr8Ga16Ge30 did not show any amorphization
or volume-collapse up to 7 GPa,31 but these are likely
to appear at higher pressures.
The bulk modulus for
the Eu8Ga16Ge30 clathrate obtained at low temperature
with the Murnaghan EOS is 65 ± 3 GPa.
Comparing
with other clathrates, Eu8Ga16Ge30 and Ba8Ga16Ge30
are the most compressible.
The guest atoms for the materials cited in Table IV
have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ionic radii with Eu ions hav-
ing the smallest radius (rEu = 1.09 ˚A; rSr= 1.13 ˚A; rBa
= 1.35 ˚A and rRb = 1.48 ˚A). Consequently, the larger
voids in the cages and the larger rattling amplitudes
in Eu8Ga16Ge30 may be responsible for the lower ob-
served pressure threshold to amorphization. In the case
of Rb6.15Si46 the lower transition pressure as compared
to the Ba8Si46 compound may be related to the signif-
icant fraction of empty cages due to non-stoichiometric
Rb content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on
type-I Ga-Ge clathrates and Sr8Si46 reported that the
speciﬁc guest ions inside the tetrakaidecahedrons inﬂu-
ence the cage framework structure.54 For the clathrate
Eu8Ga16Ge30 a probable hybridization between the Eu
5d states and the Ga/Ge 4sp orbitals coupled with the
fact that the Eu guest ion is oﬀ-center creates a shape6
anisotropy in the framework, which could produce a
cage structure that is less mechanically stable. Conse-
quently, for clathrates with the on-center guest ions such
as Ba8Ga16Ge30, the framework is more stable leading
to higher amorphization pressure. Moreover, band struc-
ture calculations performed for the A8Ga16Ge30 series
(with A = Ba, Sr and Eu) show a strong hybridiza-
tion between the unoccupied guest ion d states and the
antibonding framework states.55–58 Both Eu8Ga16Ge30
and Sr8Ga16Ge30 clathrates were reported to have sim-
ilar band gap energy although smaller when compared
to the Ba8Ga16Ge30 compound.55 The diﬀerence in the
band gap is directly related to the ionic radii in which
the larger element donates more eﬀectively the electrons
to the cages.57 The higher band gap energy for the Ba
clathrate can also explain the higher amorphization pres-
sure due to changes in the stability between the sp3 bond-
ing orbitals and the antibonding. In addition, the smaller
sizes for Sr and Eu guest ions and the capacity to de-
velop the rattling motion aﬀects the guest-framework in-
teraction, resulting in an anisotropic network which does
not happen when the ion is in the center of the cage.
This conﬁrms that the hybridization between atomic or-
bitals of guest ions and cage atoms is largely dependent
on atom type and consequently the pressure required for
the crystalline-to-amorphous transition is dependent on
this guest-host interaction, the size of the guest atom
and the fractional atomic occupation of the host cages.
To better understand the inﬂuence of rattling motion to
the observed pressure-induced amorphization, we believe
that the study of Sr8Ga16Ge30 is important. The guest
rattling motion in this Sr clathrate is smaller than in
Eu8Ga16Ge30 and larger than in Ba8Ga16Ge30, thus a
comparative evolution of their properties under pressure
should shed light on the matter.
The absorption measurements at the Eu L2-edge pro-
vide further information about the Eu-cage interaction
in Eu8Ga16Ge30.
The analysis of the XANES spectra
can provide information about the density of unoccupied
states above the Fermi Level and some possible valence
change in the Eu ions. No indication of an Eu2+ to Eu3+
transition was observed in Figure 5(a), showing that Eu
preserves its 4f 7 conﬁguration across the amorphization.
The L3 edge XANES white-line is directly related to the
number of empty 5d states. Prior to amorphization, a
continuous reduction of the white-line is observed indi-
cating a small enhance in 5d occupation, which seems to
further increase across the amorphous transition. Note
that a pressure induced 6sp to 5d is widely known to
exist in lanthanides.52,59 Thus, it is unclear if the sup-
pression of the white line is related to an internal 6sp →
5d, or due a Ge/Ga 4sp →Eu 5d charge transfers. The
increase in 5d occupation seems to contrast with previ-
ous reports of charge transfer from the guest ion to the
Ga/Ge frameworks in Ba8Ga16Ge30 and Sr8Ga16Ge30
clathrates.57 The 5d orbital is more binding than sp, thus
we speculate that the observed increase in 5d occupation
contributes to the amorphous transition by collapsing the
cages. However, as discussed for the Ba8Si46 clathrate,35
the changes in white-line intensity can be rooted in more
than one mechanism, namely, changes in 5d electron oc-
cupation without a change in local structure, such as a
result of Eu-Ga and Eu-Ge hybridization, or a change
in local structure such as relative changes in Eu-Ga and
Eu-Ge distances. Either mechanism can play a role in
altering the mechanical stability of the cages and lead to
the crystalline-to-amorphous transition.
As mentioned earlier, the decrease in XMCD intensity
as a function of pressure is not due to a valence change
in Eu atoms (Eu3+ is a J=0 ion), but rather to the col-
lapse of crystalline order. This is supported by the XRD
patterns where the amorphization occurs within a simi-
lar pressure range. In addition, the small XMCD signal
remaining around 20 GPa (20 times smaller than at ambi-
ent pressure) is explained by the paramagnetic response
of Eu2+ ions to the 0.5 T applied magnetic ﬁeld.
Finally,
the lower threshold to reach the amor-
phous phase for the Eu8Ga16Ge30 clathrate may re-
sult in important thermoelectric developments, especially
since after reaching the amorphous phase the clathrate
Eu8Ga16Ge30 did not return to its crystalline phase even
when the pressure was released and the sample heated to
300 K. This novel material in amorphous state even at
room temperature may prove interesting in terms of ther-
moelectric performance if the electronic transport can re-
main manageable in order to maximize the power factor
S2/ρ, or it may at least provide an enlightening com-
parison of the thermal and electrical conductivities of
the amorphous phase with the crystalline ones in this
PGEC material. Thermoelectric measurements are be-
ing planned with the samples in the amorphous phase to
clarify these properties.

CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the clathrate Eu8Ga16Ge30 un-
der high pressures at low temperature by powder XRD
and XANES/XMCD measurements.
A crystalline-to-
amorphous phase transition was observed above 18 GPa
by XRD. This amorphization has a dramatic inﬂuence
on the magnetic properties as can be observed from
XMCD measurements on the Eu L2 edge.
The ab-
sorption measurements showed a sharp decrease in the
XMCD intensity near the crystalline-amorphous transi-
tion, as a result of frustration of the exchange interac-
tions between Eu2+ local moments in the structurally-
disordered phase. We did not observe any valency change
of the Eu ions inside the cages.
Both structural and
magnetic measurements indicate that the structure un-
dergoes an irreversible amorphization process with pres-
sure; the crystalline and magnetic long range ordering
are not recovered when the pressure is released in the
amorphous state.
As observed in other isostructural
clathrate compounds, the main origin of this crystalline-
to-amorphous transition is the mechanical instability of7
the framework37 and its modiﬁcation under pressure due
to guest-framework interactions. The novel amorphous
phase might play an important role in the development
of clathrates as thermoelectric materials.
