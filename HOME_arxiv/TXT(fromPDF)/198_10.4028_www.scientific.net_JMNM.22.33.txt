Abstract. We present a detailed study of the magnetic behavior of iron-oxide (γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) 
nanoparticles constituents of ferrofluids (FF’s) with average particle sizes <d> = 2.5 and 10 nm. The 
particles were dispersed in the frozen liquid carrier (pure FF) and in a frozen lyotropic liquid crystalline 
matrix in the nematic phase or ferronematic (FN) (ferrolyomesophase). Both FF and FN phases displayed 
superparamagnetic (SPM) behaviour at room temperature, with blocking temperatures TB ~ 10 and 100 K for 
<d> = 2.5 and 10 nm, respectively. Dynamic ac susceptibility measurements showed a thermally activated 
Néel-Brown dependence of the blocking temperature with applied frequency. Our results show that dipolar 
interactions are small, but non-negligible, as compared to the single-particle energy barriers from magnetic 
anisotropy. From the fit of ac susceptibility we calculated the effective magnetic anisotropy constant Keff for 
2.5 nm maghemite particles. Although interparticle interactions present in highly diluted samples do not 
appreciably modify the dynamic magnetic behavior of isolated particles, the calculated magnetic anisotropy 
were abut one order of magnitude larger that the bulk materials, suggesting the existence of large surface 
anisotropy. Using the thermally activated model to fit the dynamic data yielded effective energy barriers Ea = 
3.5x10-21 J. From these data, we obtained Keff = 422 kJ/m3 for the single-particle effective magnetic 
anisotropy.  
 
 
Introduction.  
 
Nanostructures, a size regime between molecular and submicron-size structures, possess 
high surface-to-volume ratios, yielding novel properties. Many biological and biomedical 
applications uses such nanoscopic systems in a magnetic fluid or ferrofluid, a colloidal suspension 
of magnetic oxide nanograins dispersed in a liquid carrier. Depending on the characteristic of the 
liquid carrier (polar or apolar character and pH), magnetic grains are coated with an appropriate 
agent for stability purposes. The synthesis and applications of magnetic fluids for biomedical 
applications have passed the speculative stage of development, to enter into the well-based standard 
laboratory procedures. Nowadays, these particles are being used in magnetic resonance contrast 
enhancement, cell and DNA separation, drug delivery, and gene cloning. Often, the desired 
properties include large magnetic moments per formula unit, making iron oxide particles such as 
Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 appealing for these applications. For biocompatible purposes, particles are 
usually coated with noble metals (Gd, Pt, Ag), or organic substances such as dextran. [1] In spite of 
the above advancements on bio-magnetic applications, there is still a lack of precise knowledge on 
the mechanisms linking particle shape, size distribution and surface structure, to the resulting 
magnetic properties of the carrier magnetic nanoparticles.

Figure 1. Illustrative picture of different coatings for stabilize the magnetic grains 
in a particular liquid carrier: Ionic (a), surfacted (b), and citrated (c) types. 
 
The lyotropic liquid crystals as those used in this work are organized molecular systems 
formed by a mixture of amphiphilic molecules (molecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
parts) and a solvent, most often water, and their structure depends on temperature and relative 
composition of the constituents [2]. Amphiphilic aggregates in the nematic mesophase, named 
micelles (typical dimensions 10 nm), have a bilayer structure, resembling cell membranes. 
Regarding the magnetic grains, both maghemite and magnetite have a cubic spinel structure 
with two interacting magnetic sublattices. The strong superexchange coupling between A and B 
magnetic sublattices yields antiparallel alignment, and thus ferrimagnetic order below TC. The first-
order magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants are (at room temperature) K1 = 13.5 kJ/m3 and 4.7 
kJ/m3 for Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3, respectively. Interparticle interactions can modify the particle energy 
barriers, yielding a shift in the observed blocking temperature [3] due to collective freezing of the 
magnetic moments. Concurrently with dipolar interactions, other sources of magnetic anisotropy 
(e.g. surface effects) can have a major impact on the blocking process. In this scenario the freezing 
process, analyzed as a superspin-glass transition, is subject of intense debate. In this work, we 
present a magnetic characterization of magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles 
with mean size <d> of 10nm and 2.5 nm, respectively, with different concentrations to analyze the 
effects of dipolar interactions on the magnetic dynamic of the constituent particles. 
Experimental Procedure 
We have studied the magnetic interaction between the nanograins in frozen samples of a 
pure FF and a FF-doped lyotropic liquid crystals in the nematic phase. The magnetic particles of the 
starting FF were coated with a surfactant (figure 1) to prevent agglomeration, and suspended in an 
nonmagnetic solvent as illustrated in figure 1. Ferrofluids are magnetic colloids in which magnetic 
oxide nanograins are dispersed in a liquid carrier. The two main types used in this work were 
surfacted (SFF) and citrated (CFF) ferrofluids (see fig. 1). Magnetite (Fe3O4) particles having <d> = 
10 nm were studied from a commercial SFF from Ferrotec® Company, whereas the <d> = 2.5 nm 
maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) particles were from a non-commercial CFF. The ferronematic (FN) phases 
were obtained by mixing the corresponding FF with lyotropic crystals with different concentrations.

 is shown in Table I.  
Static and dynamic magnetic measurements as a function of frequency and temperature were 
performed in a commercial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design). Zero-field- cooled (ZFC) and 
field-cooled (FC) curves were taken between 5K and 250 K, for different values of cooling field 
HFC (10 Oe < H < 70 kOe). AC susceptibility of the samples was obtained for frequencies from 10-23  
 
 
to  103 Hz, as a function of temperature. Magnetization data were obtained by first cooling the 
sample from room temperature in zero applied field (ZFC process) to the basal temperature. Then a 
field was applied and the variation of magnetization was measured with increasing temperature up 
to T = 250 K. After the last point was measured, the sample was cooled again to the basal 
temperature keeping the same field (FC process); then the M vs. T data was measured for increasing 
temperatures.

Table 1. Description, structural and magnetic parameters of the samples studied in this work: mean particle 
diameter <d>, volumetric concentration RV (%), Blocking temperature TB (at H = 100 Oe), coercive fields HC 
and remanence to saturation ratio MR/MS. 
Results and Discussion 
The structural and magnetic parameters of the studied samples are condensed in Table I. The 
different average particle diameter for the two SFF and CFF samples are reflected in the blocking 
temperatures TB (fig. 2). For the SFF samples, the ZFC magnetization curves showed a broad 
maximum at ~200 K, which extends above the freezing temperature of the matrix (~260 K). 
Therefore, at our maximum measuring temperatures of ca. 250 K, some of the particles might be 
still in the blocked state. For the CFF samples, the TB values vary between 9(1) and 14(1) K, 
depending on the particle concentration. Figure 2 clearly shows that, for these samples, there will be 
no significant blocked particles at ~250 K. Indeed, the coercive fields at T = 30 K for SFF and CFF 
samples show this difference (fig. 2), since samples CFF have HC = 0 but a significant HC is 
observed for SFF samples, due to the blocked fraction. Interestingly, the blocking temperatures 
displayed in Table I show a measurable increase from the FF phase to the FN concentrated and 
diluted. We have checked the effect of interparticle interaction by evaporating a large fraction of the 
solvent in the CFF sample, obtaining a ‘dried’ sample (CFFY) where particles are closer to each 
other. It can be observed that for this sample, TB shifts upwards by ~30% of the CFF0 sample, 
indicating that the effect of dipolar interactions goes in this direction. Since the average interparticle 
distance in FN phases is much larger (high dilution) we attribute the observed increase in TB to 
particle agglomeration formed in these samples. As the concentration used were well above the 
standards for colloidal stability, this effect is likely to occur.4

For each set of samples (CFF and SFF), a slight increase in HC can be observed from the pure 
ferrofluid to the ferronematic phases. Table I also display the remanence to saturation MR/MS ratio, 
except for the FN samples, where this ratio has not clear meaning due to the diamagnetic 
contribution of the matrix, which dominates at high fields. However, for the measured ratios the 
observed value is much smaller than the expected. At T = 5 K, the MR/MS values for the samples 
studied (see Table I) are much smaller than the expected R = 0.5 value for noninteracting, randomly 
oriented particles with uniaxial symmetry. Deviations from the non-interacting values are expected, 
and moreover these low values have been related to the existence of inter-particle interactions of 
antiferromagnetic nature. [4]  
We have investigated the magnetic dynamics of the <d> = 2.5 nm ferrofluid samples, in order to 
detect the effect of interparticle interactions on the single-particle behaviour. Figure 3 displays the 
temperature dependence of χ'(T) and χ''(T) of the smallest particles (samples CFF0 and CFFY) for 
different frequencies f ranging from 20 mHz to 1 kHz. The data for both components χ'(T) and 
χ''(T) exhibit the expected behavior of SPM systems, i.e., the occurrence of a maximum at a 
temperature Tm (~TB) for both χ'(T) and χ''(T) components, which shifts towards higher values with 
increasing frequency. [3] From the empirical relationship Φ = ΔTB/TB[Δlog10(f )], where ΔTB is the 
difference between TB measured in the Δlog10(f) frequency interval, we obtained Φ = 0.089(2) and 
0.067(2) for CFF0 and CFFY, respectively, indicating the presence of interparticle interactions the 
usually yield Φ values lower than the 0.1-0.13 theoretically expected. [5,6] Accordingly, the effect 
of dipolar interactions in the more concentrated sample (CFFY) is reflected in the lower Φ value. It 
is well known that the dynamic response of an ensemble of fine particles is determined by the 
measuring time τm (or frequency) of each experimental technique. As the reversion of the magnetic 
moment in a single-domain particle over the anisotropy energy barrier Ea is assisted by thermal 
phonons, the relaxation time τ exhibits an exponential dependence on temperature characterized by

where τ0 is in the 10-9 - 10-11 s range for SPM systems. In the absence of an external magnetic 
field, the energy barrier can be assumed to be Ea = Keff V, where the proportionality constant Keff is 
an effective magnetic anisotropy.5

The linear dependence of ln(f) versus 1/TB observed in fig. 4 indicates that the Néel-Brown 
model correctly suits the behavior of CFF samples. From the fitting of the experimental T(f,H=0) 
data using Eq. 1, we obtained the values of Ea/kB = 250(7) K for CFF0 sample and Ea/kB = 412(11) 
K for the more concentrated sample CFFY. This increment in Ea agrees with the expected 
contribution from dipolar interactions to the single-particle effective energy barrier. Using the 
average particle diameter <d> = 2.5 nm, we obtained Keff = 422 kJ/m3 and 695 kJ/m3 for the 
effective anisotropies for samples CFF0 and CFFY, respectively.

The larger  Ea value found in concentrated sample should be attributed to the increase of dipolar 
interactions that add to the single particle energy barrier. However, the Keff  value calculated for the 
most diluted sample is approximately two orders of magnitude larger that the magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy constant of bulk maghemite  K1
bulk = 4.7 kJ/m3, indicating the existence of additional 
anisotropy sources. In previous works on more concentrated nanoparticle systems, large values of 
particle anisotropy are usually related to surface effects and/or the effect of dipolar interactions [3]. 
The contribution from particle-particle interactions to the experimental data is difficult to 
disentangle from the single-particle magnetic anisotropy. In addition to the intrinsic sources of6 
  
 
 
 
particle anisotropy (e.g. shape, stress and magnetocrystalline anisotropies), interparticle interactions 
(mainly the long-range dipolar interaction) can also modify the energy barrier values. In a previous 
work on a ferrofluid consisting in Fe3O4 particles of d = 5nm,[7] it was found that dipolar 
interactions were already noticeable for concentrations  RV of ~2 % vol. of magnetic particles. 
However, the high dilution of our samples (except for the dried sample, see Table 1) guarantees that 
the value of Keff obtained should be essentially the single-particle value. Surface effects have been 
invoked as a large source of magnetic anisotropy in Cobalt [8] and maghemite [9] nanoparticles. 
Our data clearly indicates that both the similarity between Keff for liquid and dried samples and the 
large Keff value are a consequence of an intrinsic property of these maghemite particles, suggesting 
that surface anisotropy is dominant. 
 
Summary 
We have studied the effect of interparticle interactions on the magnetic properties of single-
domain Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with identical size distribution but different concentration. 
We found that stronger interparticle interactions yield an increase of TB, as observed from 
agglomeration of particles in FN phases. For diluted ferrofluid samples with maghemite particles 
having <d> = 2.5 nm, the calculated anisotropy constant is much larger that the bulk value, 
indicating a large contribution to the magnetic anisotropy, which is likely to be located at the 
particle surface.
