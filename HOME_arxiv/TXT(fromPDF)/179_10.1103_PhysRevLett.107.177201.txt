Abstract 
We study the tunneling magneto thermo power (TMTP) in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic 
tunnel junction nanopillars. Thermal gradients across the junctions are generated by a 
micropatterned electric heater line. Thermo power voltages up to a few tens of µV between 
the top and bottom contact of the nanopillars are measured which scale linearly with the 
applied heating power and hence with the applied temperature gradient. The thermo power 
signal varies by up to 10 µV upon reversal of the relative magnetic configuration of the two 
CoFeB layers from parallel to antiparallel. This signal change corresponds to a large spin-
dependent Seebeck coefficient of the order of 100 µV/K and a large TMTP change of the 
tunnel junction of up to 90 %.- 2 -

Transport coefficients in ferromagnetic materials are spin-dependent.1 The giant magneto 
resistance2 and the tunneling magneto resistance (TMR)3 are the most prominent examples of 
spin dependent electronic transport. Their discovery boosted spintronics4 with important 
applications e.g. in data storage. While spintronics relies on spin dependent charge transport 
also spin dependent heat transport can become important when, e.g., a high current density in 
magnetic nanodevices creates a significant temperature gradient. The combination and 
coupling of heat, charge, and spin currents in magnetic nanostructures has recently opened a 
highly active line of research now referred to as spin caloritronics5 with important discoveries 
such as the spin-Seebeck effect6,7,8 or thermally driven spin injection9. Furthermore, thermal 
spin transfer torque was predicted to enable highly efficient magnetization reversal in 
magnetic nanodevices by thermal gradients10,11,12 and first experimental evidence has recently 
been provided.13  
For spintronics CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) are one of the most 
attractive systems as they can be reliably produced by sputter deposition14 and show very high 
TMR ratios. The latter results from the half-metallic character of the coherently tunneling Δ1 
states in the ferromagnetic electrodes.15 With respect to spin caloritronics applications recent 
ab-initio studies also predicted very high spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients of 150 µV/K 
and correspondingly high tunneling magneto thermo power (TMTP) ratios of the MTJ.16 
Furthermore magnon-assisted tunneling might contribute to TMTP especially in nanosized, 
mesoscopic MTJs.17,18 An experimental confirmation of these predictions would strongly 
impact materials research in the field of spin caloritronics.  
Here, we experimentally study TMTP in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB nanopillars in the presence 
of thermal gradients across the MTJ. We find a strong increase of the thermo power voltage 
upon reversal of the magnetic configuration of the two CoFeB layers from parallel to- 3 - 
antiparallel. The measured increase of up to 10 µV corresponds to large spin-dependent 
Seebeck coefficients of the order of 100 µV/K and to large TMTP ratios of the MTJ of 90 % 
making this material system a highly attractive candidate for future spin caloritronic 
applications.  
The MTJ stacks are sputter deposited in a Singulus NDT Timaris cluster tool on a Si 
wafer capped with 100 nm SiO2. The MTJ stack consists of a bottom contact (BC) of 3nm 
Ta/90nm Cu/5nm Ta, a pinned layer (PL) stack comprising a synthetic antiferromagnet of 
20nm PtMn/2nm Co60Fe20B20/0.75nm Ru/2nm Co60Fe20B20, the 1.5 nm MgO tunnel junction, 
the free layer (FL) of 3nm Co60Fe20B20, and a top contact of 10nm Ta/30nm Cu /8nm Ru. The 
completed stack is annealed for 90 minutes at 360° C in 1 T field and lithographically 
patterned into 160 × 320 nm² wide elliptic nanopillars. An electron micrograph of a typical 
device is shown in Fig. 1(b). Electrical top contacts (TC) to the nanopillar are provided by 
electron beam lithography and lift-off. To apply thermal gradients a 5 µm wide and 70 nm 
thick Au heater line (HL, marked by full lines) is patterned on top of the nanopillar and is 
separated from the TC by a 160 nm thick Ta2O5 dielectric. The 10 µm wide BC line (marked 
by dashed lines) is running underneath the HL. It acts as a heat sink to establish a well defined 
temperature gradient across the MTJ. The nanopillars typically show single domain 
magnetization reversal with uniaxial anisotropies between 8 mT

We characterize the spin caloric properties of our MTJ nanopillars by magneto thermo 
electrical measurements. Such measurements have been previously used to characterize e.g. 
magnetic multilayers,20 nanowires,21 and granular systems.22,23 The experimental setup is 
sketched in Fig. 1(a). Static fields up to µ0HS = 60 mT are applied in arbitrary in plane 
orientations. Thermal gradients across the MTJ are generated by applying AC or DC heater 
currents up to Iheat = 60 mA through the HL while VTP between BC and TC of one MTJ is- 4 - 
measured. In our measurements a positive VTP corresponds to a positive voltage at the TC. For 
DC heater currents VTP is measured by a nanovoltmeter. For AC measurements at AC heater 
frequencies of 10 … 80 Hz VTP is measured by a lock-in detection at the second harmonic. 
Note that Iheat also generates an easy axis field Hheat. For DC measurements Hheat is 
compensated by an external easy axis field HX whereas for AC measurements such 
compensation is not possible in our present setup. Hence while AC experiments allow 
determining VTP with better signal-to-noise ratio the measured VTP(HS) will always be 
averaged over an oscillating easy axis field ±Hheat of up to ± 6 mT.  
Fig. 2(a) shows an easy axis TMR loop (black) of one of the MTJ nanopillars (MTJ-3 in 
Table 1). The TMR is measured at a current bias of 100 µA in easy axis fields up to µ0HX = 
±25 mT. The TMR change of 110 % occurs at the reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel 
(AP) orientation of the magnetization of the 3 nm thick CoFeB free layer (FL) with respect to 
the pinned layer (PL) magnetization. In our experiments the PL magnetization is always 
oriented along the positive x-direction. Note that the sharp jumps of the TMR at the coercive 
fields HC
- and HC
+ speak for a single domain reversal behavior of the MTJ FL which is 
confirmed by well defined switching asteroids in combined easy axis and hard axis fields (not 
shown; cp. Ref. 19, Fig. 1b for a typical result).   
The red curve in Fig. 2(a) is a TMR loop taken under application of Iheat = 38 mA through 
the HL. Here, the effect of Hheat is visible and HC
- and HC
+ are both offset by about 3.5 mT to 
positive HX. Measurements of the coercive field offsets ΔHC
-, ΔHC
+ up to heater currents of 
Iheat = 60 mA show a linear scaling of Hheat with Iheat with a slope of about 0.1 mT/mA (not 
shown). Note that no significant reduction of HC with Iheat during heating is found in the 
applied current range of our experiments and thermally activated reversal can be neglected.  
Fig. 2(b) shows three typical DC measurements of VTP of the same device. VTP is 
displayed for heater powers Pheat of 21, 38 and 58 mW as function of the easy axis field HX.- 5 - 
Hheat is compensated by a static field offset. For all three curves VTP(P) in the P state is lower 
than VTP(AP) in the AP state with a maximum difference of ΔVTP ≈ 11 µV. This yields an 
average TMTP ratio of the given device of TMTP = ΔVTP/ VTP(P) ≈  32%.  
Fig. 3(a) shows the typical dependence of VTP(P,AP) on Pheat. DC and AC data agree well. 
Measurements were performed at µ0HX = ±30 mT in well defined P and AP configurations. 
VTP(P), VTP(AP) both scale linearly with Pheat and hence with the temperature gradient ΔTMTJ 
across the MTJ as expected. In Fig. 3(b) the TMTP ratio derived from the same data is plotted 
vs. Pheat. The AC data yields a constant TMTP of about 32% (full squares). Here, AC 
measurements have only been carried out up to Pheat = 34 mW. Note that the TMTP derived 
from AC measurements is typically constant over the whole power range displayed in the 
figure. Also the TMTP derived from DC measurements (open squares) is constant for Pheat ≥ 
20 mW with a comparable TMTP ≈ 29 %. The lower TMTP for Pheat ≤ 20 mW in the DC data 
can be attributed to an artifact resulting from uncompensated voltage offsets of the 
nanovoltmeter which are becoming significant at low Pheat.  
Comparison of our data to the predicted high spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients requires 
an estimate of the temperature gradient ΔTMTJ over the MgO MTJ. Therefore the HL 
resistance RHL is measured as function of Pheat (Fig. 3(c)). From the increase of RHL with Pheat 
the increase of the HL temperature ΔTHL(Pheat) can be derived by RHL = RHL,0 (1+α·ΔTHL), 
where RHL,0 is the resistance at room temperature (Pheat = 0 mW) and α = 3.9·10-3 K-1 is the 
temperature coefficient of the HL material Au.24 ΔTHL(Pheat) is plotted as red triangles in Fig. 
3(c). For maximum Pheat = 60 mW a maximum ΔTHL ≈ 15.2 K is found. Note that in parallel 
no change of resistance of the BC line and hence of the BC temperature was found. ΔTHL thus 
represents a good estimate of the temperature drop between HL and BC. Based on this the 
temperature distribution over the nanopillar structure was computed using a commercial finite 
element solver.25 We use a two dimensional model of the pillar structure including contacts- 6 - 
and insulating layers with thermal material parameters based on bulk literature values.24,26,27 
The simulations show that the dominant temperature drop occurs across the 160 nm dielectric 
between HL and TC. In Fig. 1(c) the temperature increase in the center of the pillar above the 
BC is plotted as function of layer thickness t. For the given maximum Pheat = 60 mW one 
finds a temperature drop of ΔTMTJ ≈ 41 mK across the MgO barrier (arrow). Based on this one 
can estimate a spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient of the MTJ of SMTJ = ΔVTP/ΔTMTJ ≈ 250 
µV/K comparable to the predicted value of 150 µV/K.16 Note, however, that due to the large 
uncertainty of ΔTMTJ  (e.g. due to the use of bulk values for the thermal conductivity of thin 
films) only an order of magnitude estimate of  SMTJ is feasible. 
The above ab-initio studies of TMTP in MgO based MTJs have also considered the 
angular dependence of VTP.16 Fig. 2(c,d) shows the measured angular dependence of (c) TMR 
and (d) VTP for a 360° in-plane rotation of the FL magnetization induced by a rotating static 
field HS. VTP is measured with AC heater current. VTP well follows the typical cos(φ−π) 
dependence of the TMR.28 In the TMR two jumps are found around φ ≈ ±90° when the free 
layer magnetization overcomes the hard axis. In VTP these jumps are smoothed out by the 
uncompensated AC heater field of ± 6 mT. Note that the measured angular dependence does 
not well follow the theoretical prediction of an almost constant VTP for ⎟φ⎟ <  ± 120° and a 
sharp increase near the AP orientation.16  In contrast both in collinear and tilted field 
configurations of FL and PL VTP basically follows the field dependence of the TMR. 
As listed in Table 1 our samples reveal TMTP ratios between 17 % and 42 % and TMR 
ratios between 79 % and 140 %. In the inset to Fig. 3(b) the TMTP ratios of the different 
samples are plotted as function of the TMR. No significant correlation of the amplitude of 
TMR and TMTP is found. The TMTP rather seems to scatter around a value of about 31%. 
Theoretically no close correlation of TMR and TMTP ratio is expected. While the TMR is 
sensitive to the density of states (DOS) of the two spin channels at the Fermi level the TMTP- 7 - 
is sensitive to the asymmetry of the DOS. 16  Note that VTP and hence the above TMTP ratios 
also contain contributions of all non-magnetic layers of the devices. To determine these the 
MgO barriers of some devices were shortened by pinholes29 by application of current stress 
resulting in a field independent resistance of ~ 50 Ω. Fig. 2(b) also shows VTP,short of the 
shortened MTJ-3 for Pheat = 58 mW (dashed line). VTP,short is independent of field thereby 
unambiguously confirming the origin of TMTP at the MgO MTJ.  Subtracting this 
background from VTP(P) yields a better estimate of the TMTP contribution of the 
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB MTJ. The resulting values of TMTPMTJ = ΔVTP/(VTP(P)- VTP,short) of e.g. 
72 % (MTJ-2) and 90% (MTJ-3) are significantly higher than listed in Table 1.  
Concluding we have experimentally demonstrated a large TMTP of up to 90% in 
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB MTJs making this material system a promising candidate for future spin 
caloritronics applications. The derived spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients are comparable 
to ab-initio predictions while deviations from the predicted angular dependence are found.16  
For all devices VTP(AP) was larger than VTP(P). This agrees both with ab-inito theory and with 
predictions of TMTP due to magnon-assisted tunneling in half metallic mesoscopic MTJs 
which could be relevant for our MTJ nanopillars devices.17,18 Here, future temperature 
dependent experiments could shine light on the origin of the TMTP in our devices as a strong 
temperature dependence and even a sign change of the spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient 
has been predicted by ab-initio theory.16

optical heating of MgO based MTJs of several µm lateral dimensions.30 We like to thank M.
