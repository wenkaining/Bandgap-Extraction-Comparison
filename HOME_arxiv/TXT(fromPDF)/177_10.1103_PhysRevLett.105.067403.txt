We measure the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, τ, of excitons in colloidal PbSe nanocrystals
(NCs) at low temperatures to 270 mK and in high magnetic ﬁelds to 15 T. For all NCs (1.3-2.3 nm
radii), τ increases sharply below 10 K but saturates by 500 mK. In contrast to the usual picture
of well-separated “bright” and “dark” exciton states (found, e.g., in CdSe NCs), these dynamics
ﬁt remarkably well to a system having two exciton states with comparable - but small - oscillator
strengths that are separated by only 300-900 µeV. Importantly, magnetic ﬁelds reduce τ below 10 K,
consistent with ﬁeld-induced mixing between the two states. Magnetic circular dichroism studies
reveal exciton g-factors from 2-5, and magneto-PL shows >10% circularly polarized emission.

Lead-salt semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) based on
PbS, PbSe, and PbTe are actively studied due to their
potential impact on important technologies including
telecommunication-wavelength optoelectronics (they ex-
hibit size-tunable emission spanning the near- to mid-
infrared [1–3]) and enhanced solar energy conversion
(multiple excitons can be formed upon absorption of sin-
gle photons [4, 5]). Other distinguishing characteristics
include high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields [6],
very long exciton radiative lifetimes (τ) [6–9] and the
ability to form core-shell heterostructures [10].
How-
ever, in contrast to their counterparts that emit at visi-
ble wavelengths (e.g., CdSe or CdS NCs), the fundamen-
tal electronic structure of lead-salt NCs remains an open
question, despite more than a decade of experiments and
often-conﬂicting theoretical consideration [11–14].
Electron-hole exchange interactions,
crystal struc-
ture, band symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and shape
anisotropy all inﬂuence the underlying level ordering and
oscillator strengths of band-edge excitons in colloidal
NCs [15–18]. Understanding this “exciton ﬁne structure”
is especially important in NCs because it governs both
absorptive and emissive optical properties. For example,
in the common case of CdSe NCs these properties com-
bine to split the 1S band-edge exciton into the now well-
established ﬁne structure of ﬁve distinct levels, wherein
the lowest energy state is an optically-forbidden “dark”
exciton that lies as much as ∆=2-15 meV below the near-
est optically-allowed “bright” exciton. Crucially, proof
of dark excitons in CdSe NCs relied on measurements of
PL and PL decays at low temperatures (T <2K, so that
kBT < ∆) and in high magnetic ﬁelds (B>10 T, so that
the magnetic energy gexµBB ≃∆)[15, 19, 20]. These
studies revealed surprisingly long PL lifetimes at low tem-
perature (∼1 µs) that shortened with applied ﬁeld, con-
sistent with optically-dark excitons that gain oscillator
strength due to ﬁeld-induced mixing with bright states.
In contrast with wide-gap semiconductors like CdSe
(which have wurtzite/zincblende structure and direct
bandgaps at the Brillouin-zone center Γ-point), lead-salt
semiconductors such as PbSe are narrow-gap materials
having rock-salt crystal structure and direct gaps at the
four-fold degenerate L-point at the Brillouin zone edge.
In further distinction, electrons and holes in PbSe ex-
hibit very similar masses and giant g-factors (|g|∼30)
due to strong spin-orbit coupling [21]. As such, exciton
ﬁne structure in lead-salt NCs is expected to be rather
diﬀerent, and several theoretical studies have been re-
ported for PbSe NCs: Four-band envelope wavefunction
methods ﬁrst suggested 1-5 meV exchange energies and
predicted an optically-allowed exciton ground state [11],
whereas tight-binding calculations anticipated that the
nominally degenerate L-points are split in NCs by tens of
meV by intervalley coupling [12]. More recently, empiri-
cal pseudopotential approaches [14] suggested that PbSe
NCs possess a single optically-forbidden exciton ground
state that lies ∆=2-17 meV below a 3-fold degenerate
manifold of optically-allowed exciton levels.
Experimentally, the PL decay time (τ) from PbSe
NCs was ﬁrst reported to be hundreds of nanoseconds
at room temperature [6, 7], which is long compared
to CdSe (τ=20 ns).
As a possible explanation, dark
exciton ground states and large bright-dark splittings
(∆>25 meV) were considered, as were enhanced dielec-
tric screening eﬀects [6].
Subsequent studies revealed
that τ increased to 1-5 µs upon cooling from 200→50 K,
prompting suggestions that ∆lies in this energy range
(∼kB·100 K) [8]. Moreover, τ was found to increase yet
again down to reported base temperatures of 1.4 K [8, 9],
which was attributed to freezing-out of quantized acous-
tic phonon modes in the NC (which were thought to assist
the recombination of presumed dark excitons). However,
1.4 K was not suﬃciently low to saturate τ, complicating
accurate ﬁtting of the relevant energy scale. Further, no
studies of τ in magnetic ﬁeld, which were essential for
conﬁrming bright and dark exciton states in CdSe NCs,
have been reported to date.
Here we measure PL and PL decay times τ in infrared-
emitting rocksalt PbSe NCs at temperatures over ﬁve
times lower than previously reported (to 270 mK), and
also in high magnetic ﬁelds to 15 T. We ﬁnd that
τ increases sharply below 10 K, but saturates below2

500 mK. In marked contrast to the ‘conventional’ exci-
ton ﬁne structure found in CdSe and other wide-gap NCs
(i.e., clear dark and bright exciton levels with orders-of-
magnitude diﬀerent oscillator strengths, well-separated
in energy by 2-15 meV), the dynamics in PbSe NCs
ﬁt remarkably well to a new exciton structure contain-
ing two weakly-emitting states with comparable oscillator
strength, that are split by a surprisingly small energy of
only 290-870 µeV (r=2.3-1.3 nm). This energy scale is
much smaller than recently predicted for PbSe NCs [14],
and is also much less than any quantized phonon energy
in the NC. Importantly, magnetic ﬁelds reduce τ only be-
low 10 K, consistent with ﬁeld-induced mixing between
these two states. Further, magnetic circular dichroism
studies establish the magnetic Zeeman energy of the 1S
absorbing exciton states in PbSe NCs for the ﬁrst time
(|gex| ranges from 2-5), and magneto-PL from the emit-
ting excitons reveals >10% circular polarization, also im-
plicating contributions from Zeeman-split excitons.
Oleic-acid capped PbSe NCs having high quantum
yield (>20% at 300K) were synthesized following Refs.
[2, 3] and were dissolved in liquid n-octadecane to form
dilute solid-solution ﬁlms devoid of inter-NC energy
transfer. Fig. 1(a) shows PL spectra from typical ﬁlms.
NC radii r are derived from the measured bandgap [22].
PL decays were measured in the 3He insert of a 15 T mag-
net. The samples were weakly excited by a 635 nm diode
laser delivering 70 ps pulses at 20 kHz (1.5 µW average
power). Reducing the laser power tenfold at 270 mK did
not aﬀect τ, indicating negligible heating. A 550 µm di-
ameter optical ﬁber delivered the excitation and collected
the PL, which was dispersed in a 0.3 m spectrometer and
detected with an InGaAs array or an InGaAsP photomul-
tiplier tube and photon counting electronics. PL decays
were always recorded at the PL band maximum (which
shifts with temperature [8, 23]).
Figure 1(b) shows that PL decays from r=2.3 nm PbSe
NCs are predominantly single-exponential and become
longer with decreasing temperature. Decay times τ were
extracted from single exponential ﬁts and are shown over
three orders of magnitude in temperature in Fig. 1(c).
The initial 2 µs of data are disregarded for T <100K,
to avoid artifacts from exciton cooling or residual inter-
dot energy transfer [20]. Also shown (right axis) is the
corresponding total (time- and spectrally-integrated) PL
intensity, I. In qualitative agreement with prior work [8],
τ=0.7 µs at 300 K, but increases to 5 µs upon cooling to
50 K. Critically, however, we ﬁnd that I increases by a
similar factor (of about ﬁve for this ﬁlm) over the same
temperature range, below which it remains constant. A
similar correspondence – namely, that I increases by ap-
proximately the same factor as τ – is observed for all NC
ﬁlms upon cooling to 50 K. This result strongly suggests
that non-radiative recombination channels (as opposed
to, e.g., an interplay between dark and bright exciton
states) dominates the PL dynamics above 50 K: As com-
peting non-radiative decay channels freeze out, both τ
and I should increase correspondingly. Thus, room tem-
perature PL decay times of order 1 µs, measured here
and in prior works, are likely not representative of the
actual radiative exciton lifetime in PbSe NCs. Rather,
these data suggest that τ measured in the 10-50 K range
provides a more realistic measure.
The most striking aspect of Fig.
1(c) is that τ re-
mains relatively constant from 50 to 10 K, but increases
markedly yet again at lower temperatures.
No cor-
responding change of I is observed, indicating an in-
trinsic eﬀect consistent with a redistribution of exci-
tons having near-unity PL quantum yield.
Ultra-low
temperatures <500 mK are necessary to saturate τ (at
7.5 µs in this sample).
A key feature of this data is
its remarkable agreement with a simple model of two
thermally-populated emitting exciton levels: a lowest-
energy state with slower decay time τs and a higher-lying
state with somewhat faster lifetime τf, separated in en-
ergy by ∆(see inset).
In this case, the temperature-
dependent lifetime is readily given by τ −1(T ) = (τ −1

uration of τ below 500 mK eﬀectively ﬁxes τs, permitting
∆to be ﬁt with high accuracy. In these 2.3 nm radius
NCs, we ﬁnd that ∆is surprisingly small – only 290±6
µeV. Although previous studies to 1.4 K ascribed the low-3

T upturn of τ with freezeout of quantized l=2 acoustic
phonons, we note that 290 µeV is over three times less
than the smallest acoustic phonon energy in PbSe NCs of
this size, computed numerically [24] or using Lamb the-
ory. Thus, this energy scale ∆likely reﬂects an intrinsic
splitting of the lowest two states in the exciton ﬁne struc-
ture of PbSe NCs. Moreover, τs and τf are similar (7.5
and 3.8 µs), in strong contrast to the well-deﬁned dark
and bright excitons in CdSe NCs whose lifetimes typi-
cally diﬀer by two orders of magnitude.
Figs. 2(a,b) show τ(T ) data for r=1.5 and 1.9 nm NCs,
along with similarly excellent ﬁts of the low-T data to the
model. The extracted splitting ∆decreases with NC size
approximately as 1/r2 [Fig. 2(d)], suggesting a quantum
conﬁnement origin. For all NCs, ∆is much less than the
smallest phonon energy (which falls as 1/r), even when
including realistic acoustic coupling to the surrounding
organic matrix. Both τs and τf tend to increase with NC
size, although the correlation is not strong.
We use high magnetic ﬁelds B to further clarify this
new exciton ﬁne structure. Figs. 2(a-c) also show τ(T )
measured at 15 T. For all NCs, the low-temperature life-
time is reduced to nearly its 10-50 K value, while for
T >10 K, τ is unchanged by ﬁeld. The total PL intensity
is unaﬀected by ﬁeld. These data suggest that the lowest-
energy exciton gains some oscillator strength due to ﬁeld-
induced mixing with the slightly higher-lying state. That
B reduces τ to its 10-50 K value, rather than its much
smaller 300 K value, further conﬁrms that τ at ∼50 K
reﬂects an intrinsic radiative recombination time in PbSe
NCs.
An understanding of magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects requires
some knowledge of the (heretofore-unknown) magnetic

energies of excitons in PbSe NCs. To this end, magnetic-
circular dichroism (MCD) studies were performed (fol-
lowing Ref. [25]) in a 7 T split-coil magnet using ﬁlms
of NCs diluted in poly(methyl methacrylate) to mini-
mize optical scatter. MCD, being a polarization-resolved
absorption measurement, measures primarily those exci-
tons within the ﬁne structure that have large oscillator
strength and which are responsible for absorption (these
excitons are typically higher in energy than the emitting
excitons from which PL originates, leading to the Stokes’
shift observed in PbSe and other NCs).
We measure
the Zeeman splitting EZ=gexµBB between right- and
left-circularly polarized optically-active excitons that are
split by a magnetic ﬁeld. Fig. 3(a) shows the clear 1S ab-
sorption of r=2.1 nm NCs, and the derivative-lineshape
MCD spectra, establishing that the 1S absorption is
dominated by an exciton having Zeeman-type splitting.
Fig. 3(b) shows EZ(B) for diﬀerent NC sizes, from which
the g-factors of these absorbing excitons |gex| are deter-
mined. |gex| increases from 2 to 5 from smallest to largest
NCs, which likely results from increased spin-orbit cou-
pling with decreasing band gap [26].
Although MCD
does not explicitly reveal the Zeeman energy of the low-
energy emitting states in the ﬁne structure, these studies
do provide a clear indication of the relevant magnetic
energy scales in PbSe NCs.
The detailed dependence of τ on B may now be consid-
ered. Fig. 4 shows τ(B) at 1.5 K for both large and small
PbSe NCs. In an applied ﬁeld, τ at low temperatures is
reduced by an amount that depends on the degree of mix-
ing between the lower- and higher-energy exciton levels,
which scales with the ratio of the characteristic magnetic
energy EZ to the level splitting ∆. For large PbSe NCs4
FIG. 4: Magnetic ﬁelds reduce τ at low T (1.5 K), for both
(a) large and (b) small PbSe NCs. In large NCs, where Zee-
man energies are large but ∆is small (see text), τ begins to
saturate above 10 T. Lines show ﬁts to the model of [27].
where MCD reveals large exciton magnetic energies and
where ∆is smallest, τ clearly begins to saturate at high
ﬁelds when EZ > ∆. The converse holds for small NCs:
EZ is small and ∆is big, and τ(B) does not show satu-
ration even by 15 T. These data can be roughly modeled
by adapting the theory in Ref. [27], which described B-
dependent mixing between bright and dark excitons in
CdSe NCs and its inﬂuence on τ.
Finally, magneto-PL studies show >10% circularly-
polarized infrared emission at 2.5 K and 7 T [Fig. 5(a)],
clearly implicating the role of emitting excitons in the
ﬁne structure that are Zeeman-split by magnetic ﬁelds
and which couple selectively to right- or left-circularly
polarized (σ±) light. As shown in Figs. 5(b,c), the po-
larization P=(I+ −I−)/(I+ + I−) increases with ﬁeld
(to 7 T) and decreases with temperature (to 40 K), in
qualitative agreement with a thermal population of exci-
tons occupying or mixing with Zeeman-split levels. How-
ever, since the precise symmetry, degeneracy and mixing
character of the emitting excitons are not established, P
cannot be used to quantify the relevant g-factors of these
emitting states at this time.
In summary, studies of PL and PL decay to 270 mK
and 15 T provide compelling experimental evidence for a
new type of exciton ﬁne structure in rocksalt PbSe NCs
that is qualitatively diﬀerent from that found in tradi-
tional wide-bandgap NCs such as CdSe. The data indi-
cate two weakly-emitting exciton levels with similar os-
cillator strengths that are nearly degenerate in energy
(∆<1 meV), and which mix in magnetic ﬁeld. We also
ﬁnd that τ at 300 K is likely dominated by non-radiative
channels, such that the actual radiative lifetime of exci-
tons is much longer than previously thought, of order 5
µs. MCD studies establish the magnetic (Zeeman) energy
scale of absorbing states in the exciton ﬁne structure, and
circularly polarized infrared magneto-PL is observed for
the ﬁrst time. We anticipate that single-NC or resonant
(line-narrowing) studies will further quantify the precise
ordering, symmetry, and mixing of levels within the ex-
citon ﬁne structure of PbSe and other lead-salt NCs.
