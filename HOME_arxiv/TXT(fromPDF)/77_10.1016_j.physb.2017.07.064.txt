Abstract
We clarify the two-channel Kondo eﬀect in the seven-orbital Anderson model hybridized with Γ8 conduction electrons by employing
a numerical renormalization group method. From the numerical analysis for the case with two local f electrons, corresponding to
Pr3+ or U4+ ion, we conﬁrm that a residual entropy of 0.5 log 2, a characteristic of two-channel Kondo phenomena, appears for the
local Γ3 non-Kramers doublet state. For further understanding on the Γ3 state, the eﬀective model is constructed on the basis of
a j-j coupling scheme. Then, we rediscover the two-channel s-d model concerning quadrupole degrees of freedom. Finally, we
brieﬂy introduce our recent result on the two-channel Kondo eﬀect for the case with three local f electrons.

1. Introduction
The Kondo eﬀect occurring in a dilute magnetic impurity
system has been understood almost completely both from the-
oretical and experimental viewpoints. Then, our interests have
moved onto a problem of impurity with complex degrees of
freedom. In particular, rich phenomena originating from or-
bital degrees of freedom have been actively discussed for a long
time. When an impurity spin is hybridized with multichannel
conduction bands, the concept of multi-channel Kondo eﬀect
has been proposed [1]. In particular, for the case of impurity
spin 1/2 and two conduction bands, corresponding to the over-
screening situation, it has been shown that non-Fermi liquid
ground state appears. Such non-Fermi liquid properties have
been pointed out also in a two-impurity Kondo system [2, 3].
As for the reality of two-channel Kondo eﬀect, Cox has
pointed out that two screening channels exist in the case of
quadrupole degree of freedom in a cubic uranium compound
with non-Kramers doublet ground state [4, 5].
In recent
decades, the two-channel Kondo phenomena have been con-
tinuously and widely investigated by many researchers at the
stage of Pr compounds [6]. We strongly believe that it is mean-
ingful to expand the research frontier of the two-channel Kondo
physics to other rare-earth compounds.
In this paper, we discuss the two-channel Kondo eﬀect in
the seven-orbital impurity Anderson model hybridized with Γ8
conduction electrons. In order to conﬁrm the validity of our
model for the investigation of the two-channel Kondo eﬀect,
we consider the case with two local f electrons corresponding
to Pr3+ or U4+ ion. Then, we ﬁnd a residual entropy of 0.5 log2
as a clear signal of the two-channel Kondo eﬀect for the case of
the non-Kramers Γ3 doublet ground state. By analyzing the Γ3

state on the basis of a j-j coupling scheme, we obtain the two-
channel s-d model concerning quadrupole degrees of freedom.
As an example of the development of the two-channel physics,
we brieﬂy report our recent result on the two-channel Kondo
eﬀect for the case with three local f electrons.

where fmσ is the annihilation operator for a local f electron with

(−1) for up (down) spin, I indicates Coulomb interactions, E f is
an f-electron level, n denotes the local f-electron number, λ is
the spin-orbit coupling, and Bm,m′ indicates crystalline electric
ﬁeld (CEF) potentials.
The Coulomb interaction I is expressed as

(2)
where Fk indicates the Slater-Condon parameter and ck is the
Gaunt coeﬃcient [7]. The sum is limited by the Wigner-Eckart
theorem to k = 0, 2, 4, and 6. Although the Slater-Condon
parameters should be determined for the material from the ex-
perimental results, here we set the ratio as
F0 = 10U, F2 = 5U, F4 = 3U, F6 = U,
(3)
where U is the Hund rule interaction among f orbitals. In the
spin-orbit coupling term, each matrix element of ζ is given by

Note the relation Bm,m′ = Bm′,m.
Now, we consider the case of n = 2 by appropriately adjust-
ing the value of E f. As U denotes the magnitude of the Hund
rule interaction among f orbitals, it is reasonable to set U = 1
eV. The magnitude of λ varies between 0.077 and 0.36 eV de-
pending on the type of lanthanide ions. For a Pr3+ ion, λ is
720 −730 cm−1 [9]. Thus, we set λ = 0.09 eV. In Fig. 1, we
depict the ground-state phase diagram of Hloc for n = 2 on the
plane of B0
4 and B0
6. For negative B0
6, we ﬁnd Γ5 and Γ1 states
depending on the values of B0
4, while for positive B0
6, we ob-
serve Γ3 state at a region including B0
4 = 0, sandwiched by the
Γ5 and Γ1 states.
Next, we include the hybridization with Γ8 conduction elec-
tron bands. For the purpose, we transform the f-electron basis
in Hloc from (m, σ) to (j, τ, σ), where j indicates the total angu-
lar momentum of one f-electron state, τ denotes the irreducible
representation of Oh point group, and σ in (j, τ, σ) indicates the
pseudo-spin up (↑) and down (↓) to distinguish the Kramers de-
generate state. Note that here we use the same σ both for real
and pseudo spins. For j = 7/2 octet, we have two doublets (Γ6
and Γ7) and one quartet (Γ8), while for j = 5/2 sextet, we obtain
one doublet (Γ7) and one quartet (Γ8).
Then, the local Hamiltonian is given by

(6)
where we set j = a (b) for j = 5/2 (7/2), ˜λa = −2λ, ˜λb =
(3/2)λ, ˜B j,τ denotes the CEF potential energy, f jτσ indicates the
annihilation operator of f electron in the bases of (j, τ, σ), and
˜I denotes the Coulomb interactions between f electrons.
Here we assume the hybridization between Γ8 conduction
electrons and Γ8 quartet of j = 5/2, since the j = 5/2 states
should be mainly occupied for the case of n < 7. Then, the
seven-orbital Anderson model is expressed as
H =

(7)
where εk is the dispersion of conduction electron with wave
vector k, ckτσ is the annihilation operator of a Γ8 conduction
electron, τ (=α and β) distinguishes the Γ8 quartet, and V is the
hybridization between conduction and localized electrons.
In order to diagonalize the impurity Anderson model, we
employ a numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
[10, 11], in which we logarithmically discretize the momentum
space so as to eﬃciently include the conduction electrons near
the Fermi energy. The conduction electron states are character-
ized by “shells” labeled by N, and the shell of N = 0 denotes
an impurity site described by the local Hamiltonian. Then, af-
ter some algebraic calculations, the Hamiltonian is transformed
into the recursive form
HN+1 =

(c†

(8)
where Λ is a parameter used for logarithmic discretization, cNτσ
denotes the annihilation operator of the conduction electron in
the N-shell, and tN indicates the “hopping” of the electron be-
tween N- and (N + 1)-shells, expressed by
tN =
(1 + Λ−1)(1 −Λ−N−1)

The initial term H0 is given by
H0 = Λ−1/2[Hloc +

For the calculation of thermodynamic quantities, the free en-
ergy F for the local f electron is evaluated in each step as
F = −T(ln Tre−HN/T −ln Tre−H0
N/T),
(11)
where a temperature T is deﬁned as T = Λ−(N−1)/2 in the NRG
calculation and H0
N denotes the Hamiltonian without the impu-
rity and hybridization terms. Then, the entropy S imp is obtained
by S imp = −∂F/∂T and the speciﬁc heat Cimp is evaluated by
Cimp = −T∂2F/∂T 2. In the NRG calculation, M low-energy
states are kept for each renormalization step. In this paper, we
set Λ = 5 and M = 2, 500.

In Fig. 2(a), we show the contour color map of the entropy
on the plane of B0
4 and T for B0
6 = 2 × 10−5 and V = 0.75.
For the visualization of the behavior of entropy, the color of
the entropy is deﬁned between 0 and 1.5, as shown in the right
color bar. For B0
4 ≤−10−4, corresponding to the Γ5 region in
Fig. 1, when a temperature is decreased, we ﬁnd a short plateau
of the entropy log 2 (green region), but the entropy is eventually
released at low temperatures, while for B0
4 ≥5 × 10−4, corre-
sponding to the Γ1 region in Fig. 1, the entropy is promptly re-
leased at low temperatures, without entering the plateau of the
entropy log 2. However, in the region of −10−4 ≤B0
4 ≤5×10−4,
we widely observe a entropy 0.5 log2 (yellow region), a charac-
teristic of the two-channel Kondo eﬀect. We emphasize that the
yellow region overlaps with the Γ3 one in Fig. 1, although it has
a small overlap with the Γ1 region. Thus, we conclude that the
two-channel Kondo eﬀect widely occurs in the Γ3 non-Kramers
doublet ground state, as was pointed out by Cox.

4 = 0 and

6 = 10−5.
In Fig. 2 (b), we show the result for B0
6 = −2 × 10−5 and
V = 0.75. For B0
4 values corresponding to the Γ5 and Γ1 re-
gions in Fig. 1, in comparison with Fig. 2(a), we ﬁnd similar
behavior of the temperature dependence of the entropy in each
region. In sharp contrast to Fig. 2(a), we do not ﬁnd the wide
yellow region in Fig. 2(b), since for negative B0
6, the Γ3 ground
state does not appear. However, we observe a very narrow yel-
low region near B0
4 = −10−4, suggesting the entropy 0.5 log 2
of the non-Fermi liquid behavior, which is known to appear at
a boundary point between Kondo and non-Kondo phases corre-
sponding to the diﬀerent ﬁxed points in a two-orbital Anderson
model [12, 13, 14]. In the present case, we obtain the standard
Kondo eﬀect in the Γ5 state, while the singlet state appears in
the Γ1 state. Thus, near the boundary between the Γ5 (Kondo)
and Γ1 (non-Kondo) states, we expect the non-Fermi liquid be-
havior just at a critical point.
In Fig. 2(c), in order to reconﬁrm the above results, we show
the contour color map of the entropy on the plane of B0
6 and T
for B0
4 = 0 and V = 0.75. As expected from Figs. 2(a) and 2(b),
we ﬁnd the wide yellow region for B0
6 ≥3 × 10−6, almost corre-
sponding to the Γ3 region in Fig. 1. For negative B0
6, since there
is no Γ3 region in Fig. 1, we do not observe the wide yellow
region, but again, we ﬁnd the narrow sharp yellow region near
B0
6 = −10−5. From these results, we deduce that the curve for
the critical points of the non-Fermi liquid state runs in the Γ1
state along the boundary between the Γ5 and Γ1 regions. It is
worth while to investigate how the curve for the critical points
merges to the wide non-Fermi liquid region in the Γ3 phase, but
this point will be discussed elsewhere in the future.
Finally, let us consider the V dependence of the entropy. In
Fig. 3, we show the contour map of entropy on the (V, T) plane
for B0
4 = 0 and B0
6 = 10−5 with the Γ3 local ground state. We
emphasize that the 0.5 log 2 entropy does not appear only at a
certain value of V, but it can be observed in the wide region
of V as 0.6 < V < 0.9 in the present temperature range. This
behavior is diﬀerent from that in the non-Fermi liquid state due
to the competition between CEF and Kondo-Yosida singlets for
f 2 systems [15, 16, 17]. We also remark that the two-channel
Kondo eﬀect appears for relatively large values of V in the
present energy scale of U = D = 1 eV.
33. Analysis of Eﬀective Model
From the NRG calculation results on the seven-orbital An-
derson model, we believe that the two-channel Kondo eﬀect is
conﬁrmed to occur for the case of n = 2 in the local Γ3 ground
state. We also have found the non-Fermi liquid behavior just at
the critical point between Γ5 and Γ1 states.
However, it is diﬃcult to describe the electronic state of the
Γ3 non-Kramers doublet from a microscopic viewpoint, since
all the f orbitals are included in the present calculations. In
order to clarify this point and visualize the Γ3 state, we con-
struct the eﬀective Hamiltonian including only j = 5/2 states
by exploiting a j-j coupling scheme [18, 19, 20].
The model is given by the sum of eﬀective Coulomb interac-
tion and CEF potential terms as
Heﬀ=

(12)
where ˜Ba,τ is the CEF potential for one f electron in the j =
5/2 state, ˜E f denotes the f-electron level to adjust the local
f-electron number, and ˜Iaa,aa denotes the eﬀective interaction
between f electrons in the j = 5/2 states.
The CEF potential is given by
˜Ba,α = ˜Ba,β = 120 · 11
7
B0
4, ˜Ba,γ = −240 · 11
7
B0
4,
(13)
where B0
4 is the same as that in Eq. (1). Note that τ = α and
β denote Γ8 states, while τ = γ indicates Γ7 state. The factor
11/7 is obtained from the discussion on the Stevens factor [19],
but the value is in common between the LS and j-j coupling
schemes, since these two pictures provide the same results for
one f-electron case. Thus, this term should be always given in
the present form. We also note that the 6th-order CEF terms
do not appear in the CEF potentials in the j-j coupling scheme,
since the maximum change in the z-component of total angu-
lar momentum is equal to ﬁve in the j = 5/2 sector. Namely,
when we use the bases of j, the eﬀect of B0
6 terms appears only
through the j = 7/2 states.
In order to explain the prescription to obtain the eﬀective
Coulomb interaction ˜Iaa,aa, we separate it into two parts as
˜Iaa,aa
τ1σ1τ2σ2,τ3σ3τ4σ4 = ˜I(0)
τ1σ1τ2σ2,τ3σ3τ4σ4 + ˜I(1)
τ1σ1τ2σ2,τ3σ3τ4σ4,
(14)
where ˜I(0) denotes the Coulomb interactions among f electrons
in the j = 5/2 states in the limit of λ = ∞, whereas ˜I(1) indicates
the correction term due to the eﬀect of ﬁnite value of λ.
Concerning the Coulomb interactions ˜I(0), here we brieﬂy ex-
plain the way to derive them. The matrix elements of ˜I(0) are
calculated by the Coulomb integrals with the use of the wave
functions of j = 5/2 states. Such Coulomb integrals are ex-
pressed by three Racah parameters, deﬁned as [18]
E0 = F0 −
80
1225F2 −12
441F4,
E1 = 120
1225F2 + 18
441F4,
E2 =
12
1225F2 −
1
441F4.
(15)
Again we should note that the eﬀect of the 6th-order Slater-
Condon parameter F6 is not included in the Coulomb integrals
evaluated from the j = 5/2 states. The explicit forms of ˜I(0)
with the use of E0, E1, and E2 are found in the Appendix.
Next we consider the term ˜I(1), which plays important role
to stabilize the Γ3 state. As mentioned above, the eﬀect of the
6th-order CEF potential B0
6 is not included in the CEF potential
term Eq. (13). In order to include eﬀectively the 6th-order CEF
potential terms, it is necessary to consider the two-electron po-
tentials, leading to the eﬀective interaction ˜I(1). A straightfor-
ward way to include the eﬀect of B0
6 terms into the j = 5/2
states is to apply the perturbation theory in terns of 1/λ to con-
sider eﬀectively the contribution from the j = 7/2 states [19].
The calculations are tedious, but it is possible to obtain system-
atically the matrix elements of the eﬀective interaction. It is
also possible to obtain such eﬀective interactions numerically
[20]. In the present paper, we propose another complementary
way to obtain the analytic forms of the matrix elements of ˜I(1)
in order to promote our understanding on the f-electron state.
For the purpose, we consider the eﬀective model of Hloc
which reproduces well the low-energy states, namely, the CEF
states in the multiplet characterized by the total angular mo-
mentum J. Such an eﬀective model is known as the Stevens
Hamiltonian, expressed by Stevens’ operator equivalent as
HS =B0
4(n, J)( ˆO0
4 + 5 ˆO4
4)+B0
6(n, J)( ˆO0
6 −21 ˆO4
6),
(16)
where Bq
p(n, J) and ˆOq
p denote, respectively, the CEF parameter
and the Stevens’ operator equivalent for n and J. The matrix
elements of ˆOq
p for any value of J have been already tabulated
by Hutchings. Here we explicitly show the values of n and J in
the parentheses of the CEF parameter, since it is necessary to
distinguish them from B0
4 and B0
6 for J = ℓ= 3 in Eq. (1).
Note that HS is the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the multiplet
speciﬁed by J for any values of U and λ, as long as they are
suﬃciently larger than the typical size of the CEF potential en-
ergy. For the case of n = 2, the ground-state multiplet is charac-
terized by J = 4 with nine-fold degeneracy. This degeneracy is
lifted by the CEF potential into Γ1 singlet, Γ3 doublet, Γ4 triplet,
and Γ5 triplet. These results do not depend on the values of U
and λ, except for the values of the eigenenergies.
Our idea to derive the eﬀective interaction is as follows. We
express the state of |J, Jz⟩for n = 2 by the linear combina-
tions of the two-electron state f †
aτ1σ1 f †
aτ2σ2|0⟩, where Jz denotes
the z-component of J and |0⟩indicates the vacuum. Since the
non-zero matrix elements are obtained from the evaluation of
⟨J, J′
z|HS |J, Jz⟩, it is possible to derive the eﬀective interaction
among two-electron states.
Here we should pay due attention to the treatment of B0
4 term
in HS . As easily understood from Eqs. (12) and (13), we al-
ready include the B0
4 term in the one-electron potential, which,
of course, induces the potentials for two-electron states. Thus,
if we also include the B0
4 term into the potential for the two-
electron states through the evaluation of HS , such B0
4 eﬀects are
doubly counted. We note that Eq. (13) correctly provides the
potentials acting on the two-electron states. In order to avoid
such double counting, we suppress the B0
4 term for the deriva-
tion of ˜I(1) from HS .

Then, we obtain ˜I(1) by evaluating B0
6(n, J)( ˆO0

6) with
the use of the two-electron state f †
aτ1σ1 f †
aτ2σ2|0⟩. We show the
explicit forms of ˜I(1) in the Appendix, in which ˜I(1) is expressed
by B6, deﬁned as
B6 = B0
6(2, 4) = R6(2, 4)B0

(17)
Here R6(n, J) = γ(n)
J /γℓwith the Stevens factor γ(n)
J
and γℓ=
−4/(9 · 13 · 33) [21].
As for the value of R6(2, 4), we obtain R6(2, 4) = −68/1155
in the limit of U = ∞(the LS coupling scheme). On the other
hand, in the limit of λ = ∞(the j-j coupling scheme), we ﬁnd
R6(2, 4) = 0, which is quite natural, since the B0
6 terms do not
appear for the j = 5/2 states. For ﬁnite values of U and λ, we
do not know the analytic value of R6(2, 4), but we can obtain
it numerically. The curve of R6(2, 4) versus λ/U is depicted in
Fig. 4. We observe that the value of R6(2, 4) changes smoothly
from −68/1155 at λ/U ≪1 to 0 at λ/U ≫1. Here we point
out that in actual materials, λ/U is in the order of 0.1 in the
transition region from the value in the LS coupling scheme to
that in the j-j coupling scheme. For λ = 0.09 and U = 1, we
ﬁnd R6(2, 4) = −0.0388.
Now the eﬀective local model Heﬀis ready. In Fig. 5(a),
we show the ground-state phase diagram of Heﬀon the (B0
4, B0
6)
plane for the same parameters as in Fig. 1. The basic structure
of the appearance of the phases is the same as that in Fig. 1.
Namely, for negative B0
6, Γ5 and Γ1 states are found for B0
4 < 0
and B0
4 > 0, respectively, whereas for positive B0
6, the Γ3 state
appears between Γ5 and Γ1 states. The phase boundary curves
are found to be deviated slightly from those in Fig. 1, but we
conclude that the local phase diagram of Heﬀis essentially the
same as that of Hloc for small B0
4 and B0
6.
Let us now move on to the NRG result of the eﬀective An-
derson model, given by

Namely, the wide yellow region is found for

in Fig. 5(a). In comparison with Fig. 2(c), we point out that the
green color seems to be darker, suggesting that the regions of
the plateau of log 2 becomes wider than those in Fig. 2(c). For
negative B0
6, as we have found in Fig. 2(c), we do not observe
the wide yellow region, but the narrow sharp yellow region is
found near B0
6 = −10−5. In comparison with Fig. 2(c), the
plateau of 0.5 log2 is found even at lower temperatures, clearly
suggesting the existence of the critical point between the Γ5
and Γ1 regions. Note that we can also ﬁnd the same behavior
in Fig. 2(c), if we change more precisely the values of B0
6 near
B0
6 = −10−5.
Since the results on the eﬀective Hamiltonian have been es-
sentially the same as those on the original seven-orbital model,
we believe that it is allowed to analyze the Γ3 state on the basis
of the j-j coupling scheme with the eﬀective interactions. Then,
after some algebraic calculations, we ﬁnd that the ground-state
Γ3 states are expressed as
|Γ3α⟩=

We ﬁnd that the main components of Γ3 doublet states are
given by the singlets, |S 78α⟩and |S 78β⟩[22]. It is clearly under-
stood that the Γ3 non-Kramers states are non-magnetic and the
quadrupole degrees of freedom are carried out by Γ8 orbitals.
Then, the orbital operators T = (T x, T y, T z) are given by
T z = 1
2(|S 78α⟩⟨S 78α| −|S 78α⟩⟨S 78α|),
T + = T x + iT y = |S 78α⟩⟨S 78β|,
T −= T x −iT y = |S 78β⟩⟨S 78α|.
(22)
When we consider the second-order perturbation in terms of the
hybridization, we arrive at the two-channel model with orbital
degrees of freedom as
H =

(23)
where J denotes the Kondo exchange coupling and τσ

The Hamiltonian H is just the same as the two-channel
Kondo model introduced by Nozi´eres and Blandin, when we
consider two screening channels for the exchange process of
quadrupole (orbital) degrees of freedom in a cubic uranium
compound with non-Kramers doublet ground state, as Cox has
pointed out.
This model is well known to exhibit the two-
channel Kondo eﬀect.
4. Discussion and Summary
In this paper, we have conﬁrmed the appearance of the two-
channel Kondo eﬀect in the Γ3 non-Kramers doublet state for
the case of n = 2 by analyzing numerically the seven orbital
impurity Anderson model hybridized with Γ8 conduction bands.
It is true that the two-channel Kondo eﬀect in the Γ3 state has
been already discussed for a long time by many researchers,
but we believe that it is meaningful to obtain the two-channel
Kondo eﬀect without considering any assumption on the CEF
excitation at an impurity site.
Concerning the future research development, we emphasize
that it is possible to consider the cases for all rare-earth ions
from Ce3+ (n = 1) to Yb3+ (n = 13). For the purpose, we as-
sume the hybridization of Γ8 conduction electrons with j = 7/2
states for the case of n ≥7, whereas we consider the hybridiza-
tion between conduction and local j = 5/2 electrons for the
case of n < 7. The results will be shown elsewhere in the fu-
ture, but here we brieﬂy explain our recent results for the case
of Nd3+ (n = 3) [23].
In the seven-orbital impurity Anderson model hybridized
with Γ8 conduction electrons, we have conﬁrmed the two-
channel Kondo eﬀect for the case of n = 3 with the local Γ6
ground state. To detect the two-channel Kondo eﬀect emerg-
ing from Nd ion, we have proposed to perform the experiments
in Nd 1-2-20 compounds. We expect the appearance of two-
channel Kondo eﬀect for other values of n, even for n > 7 cor-
responding to heavy rare-earth ion.
In summary, we have shown the two-channel Kondo eﬀect
for the case of n = 2 with the local Γ3 ground state from
the NRG calculations of the seven-orbital impurity Anderson
model hybridized with Γ8 conduction electrons. Since it is pos-
sible to change easily the local f-electron number, further stud-
ies on the present model are believed to make signiﬁcant con-
tributions to the development of new materials to exhibit the
two-channel Kondo eﬀect.

Appendix A. Matrix elements of the eﬀective interactions
In this Appendix, we explicitly show the equations for the
matrix elements of the eﬀective interactions Eq. (14). To save
6space, we do not separately show ˜I(0) and ˜I(1), but we exhibit
the explicit forms of ˜Iaa,aa.
Before proceeding to the exhibition of the results, we remark
the classiﬁcation of the states by using total angular momentum
under the cubic CEF potential. Without the CEF potential, the
j = 5/2 states are speciﬁed by jz, which is the z-component
of j, running between jz = −5/2, −3/2, · · · , 5/2. When we
include the cubic CEF potential, we obtain Γ7 and Γ8 states, but
two states of jz and j′
z with |jz −j′
z| = 4 are mixed due to the
CEF potential. Then, the Γ8 states are expressed as
faα↑=
r
5
6 f5/2,−5/2 +
r
1
6 f5/2,3/2,
faα↓=
r

6 f5/2,5/2 +
r

6 f5/2,−3/2,
faβ↑= f5/2,−1/2,
faβ↓= f5/2,1/2,
(A.1)
while Γ7 states are given by
faγ↑=
r

6 f5/2,−5/2 −
r

6 f5/2,3/2,
faγ↓=
r

6 f5/2,5/2 −
r

6 f5/2,−3/2,
(A.2)
where f j, jz denotes an annihilation operator of f electron in the
basis of j and jz.
Here we introduce the modiﬁed total angular momentum ˜j
running among ±3/2 and ±1/2, since the state of jz = 5/2
(−5/2) belongs to the same group as that of jz = −3/2 (3/2)
under the cubic CEF potentials. Thus, we obtain ˜j = 3/2 for
Γ8α↑and Γ7↑, ˜j = −3/2 for Γ8α↓and Γ7↓, ˜j = 1/2 for Γ8β↓, and
˜j = −1/2 for Γ8β↑.
For the two-electron state f †
aτ1σ1 f †
aτ2σ2|0⟩, we deﬁne the mod-
iﬁed total angular momentum ˜J from ˜j1 + ˜j2. Then, we clas-
sify the two-electron states into four groups, characterized by
˜J = 0, ±1, 2.
The matrix elements of ˜I(0) calculated from the Coulomb in-
tegrals are expressed by three Racah parameters, E0, E1, and
E2, in Eq. (15).
Concerning ˜I(1), we derive the matrix ele-
ments from the evaluation of B0
6(n, J)( ˆO0
6 −21 ˆO4
6) in Eq. (16)
with the use of the two-electron states. In the following, we set
B6 = B0
6(2, 4), as deﬁned in Eq. (17).

Note the relation of ˜Iaa,aa
τ4σ4τ3σ3,τ2σ2τ1σ1 = ˜Iaa,aa
τ1σ1τ2σ2,τ3σ3τ4σ4.
To check the above matrix elements, we diagonalize the
Coulomb matrix for each ˜J and obtain 15 eigenenergies in
total.
Among them, the nonet of J = 4 is split into four
groups as Γ1 singlet with E0 −5E2 −100800B6, Γ3 doublet with
E0 −5E2 + 80640B6, Γ4 triplet with E0 −5E2 + 5040B6, and Γ5
triplet with E0 −5E2 −25200B6. Note that they are equal to the
CEF energies of f 2 states for the case of B0
4 = 0. The quintet of
J = 2 and the singlet of J = 0 are not inﬂuenced by the B0
6 term
and their energies are determined only by the Coulomb interac-
tions, leading to E0 + 9E2 for J = 2 and E0 + 3E1 for J = 0,
7respectively. We note that the quintet of J = 2 is split into two
groups of Γ3 doublet and Γ5 triplet, when we consider the B0
4
term of the one-electron potential.
Finally, it is instructive to pick up the interactions between
Γ8 states, leading to a two-orbital local Hamiltonian, given by
H = U
X
τ
ρτ↑ρτ↓+ U′ραρβ + J
X
σ,σ′
f †
ασ f †
βσ′ fασ′ fβσ
+ J′(f †
α↑f †
α↓fβ↓fβ↑+ h.c.),
(A.7)
where ρτσ = f †
τσ fτσ and ρτ = ρτ↑+ ρτ↓. The coupling constants
U, U′, J, and J′ denote intra-orbital, inter-orbital, exchange,
and pair-hopping interactions, respectively, expressed by E0,
E1, E2, and B6 as
U = E0 + E1 + 2E2 −7200B6,
U′ = E0 + 2
3E2 −2400B6,
J = 5E2 + 21600B6,
J′ = E1 −11
3 E2 −26400B6.
(A.8)
Note the relation of U = U′ + J + J′, ensuring the rotational
invariance in the orbital space for the interaction part. We also
note that the relation of U = U′ + J + J′ holds even for B6 = 0.
On the other hand, the relation of J = J′ does not hold in the
present case in sharp contrast to the d-electron case. It is quite
natural, since this relation is due to the reality of the wavefunc-
tion and in the j-j coupling scheme, the wavefunction is com-
plex. When we eﬀectively include the eﬀect of the sixth-order
CEF potentials in the Γ8 model, it is reasonable to consider the
situation of J < 0, leading to the stabilization of the Γ3 state.
