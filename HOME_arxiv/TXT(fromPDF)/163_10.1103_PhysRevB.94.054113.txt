The realization of long range and insulating ferromagnetic states in topological insulator (TI) has been a 
pressing issue since its discovery. Only recently, such state was achieved in Cr-doped Bi2-xSbxTe3, 
leading to the discovery of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). However, the effect is only 
observed at extremely low temperatures mainly due to the limited magnetism. To fully understand the 
mechanism of the ferromagnetic ordering whereby improving the ferromagnetism, we investigated 4f 
transition metal-doped Bi2Se3, using density-functional-theory approaches. We found that Eu and Sm 
prefer the Bi substitutional sites with large magnetic moments to ensure stable long-range ferromagnetic 
states. Additionally, codoping can be a novel strategy to preserve the insulating property of the host 
material as well as improving the incorporation of magnetic dopants. Our findings thus offer the critical 
step in facilitating the realization of QAHE in TI systems.

The discovery of the long-sought quantum anomalous Hall 
state (QAHS) in topological insulators (TIs) has attracted 
tremendous research interests in recent years1-4. Long range, stable, 
and carrier-free ferromagnetism is critical to realize QAHS in TI 
materials5-8. Typically, Bi2Se3 and similar compounds are 
promising candidates of the second generation TIs for such 
application9-15. However, the magnetic doping mechanism of such 
materials is still not well understood7,16, and a stable 
ferromagnetism remains to be achieved17.  
Generally, the difficulty in achieving a stable ferromagnetic 
ordering in Bi2Se3 rises from the following reasons: i) the 
traditional magnetic impurities, such as 3d metals, normally exhibit 
low solubilities17-19 on the substitutional site due to their large 
size-mismatch with the host; ii) The interaction between d-d bands 
of the impurities tend to induce the formation of clusters that may 
destroy the long-range ordering20-22; and iii) the unfavorable 
super-exchange mechanism often leads to a transformation from 
ferromagnetism to non-ferromagnetism or anti-ferromagnetism. 
For instance, it was reported that Cr-doped Bi2Se3 can be both 
ferromagnetic (FM)21 and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM)23, implying a 
competition between the FM and AFM couplings among the Cr 
impurities. The super-exchange mechanism was later verified by 
an ab-initio study17, in spite that the ground state of Cr-doped 
Bi2Se3 is FM. As a result, the total energy of the FM state is only 
about 10 meV lower than that of an AFM state, resulting in a low 
Curie temperature1. 
Besides the 3d transition metals (TMs), 4f TMs could be 
promising candidates to realize stable long-range ferromagnetism 
in Bi2Se3. Because they possess atomic radii comparable to the 
host Bi atoms, the size-mismatch will not be a severe problem. For 
example, the ionic radius24 of 4f TM Eu3+ is 0.95 Å, which is 
closer to that of Bi3+ (1.03 Å), compared with that of Cr3+ (0.62 Å). 
Also, the f bands are more localized and less interactive than the d 
bands, naturally suppressing the formation of impurity clusters. 
Another advantage of the 4f elements is attributed to their large 
atomic mass, which gives stronger spin-orbital coupling (SOC) 
strength than 3d elements. From the viewpoint of van Vleck 
mechanism, this is better for the FM order. Furthermore, as the f 
bands have more electronic orbitals than the d bands have, they 
could possess even higher magnetic moment and hence a stronger 
FM coupling. Until now, however, a systematic investigation is 
still lacking.     
In this study, to address the above questions, we investigated 
the dopabilities and magnetism of 4f elements in Bi2Se3 by ab 
initio calculations, based on density functional theory (DFT) [see 
computational details in Supplementary Information (SI)]. We 
found that the formation energy of 4f TM impurities on the Bi sites 
is lower than that on the interstitial sites. Several 4f substitutional 
impurities were found to possess large magnetic moments and 
strong FM coupling. Among these impurities, Eu and Sm show 
very large magnetic moment of 6.33 and 5.06 µB, respectively, and 
both with strong FM character. The calculated energy difference 
between the FM state and AFM state is about 3-4 times larger than 
that of CrBi, as reported in previous works17. Besides Eu and Sm, 
Tb and Dy are also promising candidates for their large magnetic 
moment, moderately-stable FM state, and low formation energy. 
Moreover, to realize long range and insulating FM states, we 
proposed a novel method, i.e., codoping electron donors with the 
impurities such as Eu. This way, the Fermi level can be tuned, 
while the formation energy of the impurities can be lowered. These 
findings can have important implications on the realization of the 
quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). 
We first consider TMs at the interstitial and Se sites, as these 
impurities, TMi and TMSe, often cause large changes in the 
electronic structure, whereby leading to a deterioration of the 
magnetic ordering, and hence should be avoided. Our calculation 
reveals that the 4f impurities are unlikely to occupy these 
detrimental sites. Consider for example, the TMis. There are two2 
types of them in the Bi2Se3 lattice, namely, the octahedral and 
tetrahedral sites, each with 6 different configurations. We have 
examined all of them and found that the most stable one is on the 
octahedral site between two QLs. Yet, it’s significantly more 
difficult to form TMi than to form TMBi, as the formation energy of 
TMi is at least 1.08 eV higher than that of TMBi at the most 
favorable Bi-rich conditions. This difference is noticeably larger 
than the reported 0.29 eV for the 3d TM impurities17, implying that 
the 4f TMs are very unlikely to occupy any of the interstitial sites. 
This is mainly due to the relatively large sizes of the 4f TMs that 
better match Bi than the 3d TMs do. 
Next, we consider eight selected TMBi impurities, which are 
Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er. The calculated formation 
energies are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the Se chemical 
potential. Except for EuBi, SmBi and HoBi, the calculated formation 
energies are always negative, regardless the growth conditions. 
This is in line with experimental observation that a number of the 
4f elements can form continuous alloy with Bi2Se3 and/or 
Bi2Te3
25-28. It is noted that Eu and Gd have a significantly large 
difference in the formation energy (> 1.3eV), even though they are 
adjacent neighbors in the Periodic Table. As this difference cannot 
be understood solely by the atomic-size difference, we have 
studied the effect of atomic chemical potentials on the formation of 
these impurities (see Fig. S1 in SI). We found that to avoid the 
formation of secondary phases, in particular, TM selenides, the 
maximum Eu chemical potential at equilibrium is -4.11 eV, which 
is 0.43 eV lower than that of Gd (-3.68 eV). The reason for the 
lower chemical potential of Eu lies in its exceptionally stable 
secondary phase EuSe, where Eu has a valence +2, leaving behind 
with a very stable half-occupied f band, according to the Hund's 
rule. The lower chemical potential for Eu here is consistent with 
the larger impurity formation energy. The remaining formation 
energy difference between Eu and Gd may be attributed to their 
different electronic structures – while GdBi has occupied f bands 
deeply buried inside the valence band, EuBi has its partially 
occupied bands near the Fermi level, and hence EuBi cannot be 
nearly as stable as GdBi. 
To understand their magnetic behavior, we calculated the 
magnetic moments of all 4f TMs and TABLE I lists the results. 
These results suggest that the crystal filed splitting of those 4f 
impurities is generally weak in Bi2Se3, associated with the 
corresponding exchange splitting (see SI for detailed discussions 
on crystal field splitting and exchange splitting). We note that 
among all the candidates, GdBi and EuBi have the largest magnetic 
moments, being 7µB and 6.33µB, respectively, in the direction 
perpendicular to Bi2Se3 QLs. These values are greater than the 
maximum magnetic moment of 5µB ever possible for 3d TM 
impurities17. 
A stable long-range magnetic order depends not only on the 
 
local magnetic moment, but also on the coupling of the magnetic 
moments in the same direction. To estimate the magnetic coupling 
in a solid, one usually places two TM impurities in a supercell, 
with a set of different distances, and then calculate the energy 
difference between the FM and AFM states (defined here as 
ΔEFM-AFM/2). By using this approach, we found that the strongest 
coupling between TM impurities typically happens at the second 
nearest neighbor distance within the same QL (whose energy 
difference, when significant, is given in TABLE I), while the 
coupling of impurities between QLs can be noticeably smaller. The 
results show that the FM coupling is favorable in Sm- and 
Eu-doped Bi2Se3 and moderately favorable in Tb- and Dy-doped 
Bi2Se3, while the Er- and Gd-doped Bi2Se3 favors a weak AFM 
coupling. Note that massive Dirac fermion has been observed 
experimentally in Dy-doped Bi2Te3 up to room temperature28, 
implying the existence of a long-range FM order. Nd in TABLE I 
represents a different case in which the nearest neighbor FM 
coupling (21 meV) is the strongest, but the second nearest neighbor 
coupling is only 1 meV. 
To further our understanding, we compare the band structure 
and projected density of states (PDOS), shown in Fig. 2(a)-(f), for 
Eu and Gd. The band gap for defect-free Bi2Se3 is 0.30 eV. This 
value is reduced to 30 and 79 meV, respectively, for Eu- and 
Gd-doped systems (see SI for detailed discussion on the reliability 
of the obtained band gap). The gap narrowing phenomenon may be 
understood as a combined result of the SOC and p-f couplings near 
the valence band maximum (VBM). It is known that the 4f states

FIG 1. Calculated formation energy of eight TMBi 
impurities, as a function of the chemical potential 
of Se.3 
 
are usually more localized than the 3d states. This is typified by the 
highly-localized impurity states inside the band gap for Eu, as can 
be seen in Figs. 2 (b) and (e). In contrast, for Gd, the impurity 
bands are much deeper, about -3.5 to -4.5 eV below the Fermi level, 
as revealed by Fig. 2 (f), due to the extra f electron of Gd. While 
according to the Hund's rule, having 7 electrons half-occupying the 
f shell makes the Gd impurity very stable, the lower f bands also 
make the p-f coupling less significant than the Eu-doped case, so 
the band gap of the former is also noticeably larger than the latter. 
The band structures in Fig. 2 provide us with a qualitative 
picture for the formation of the FM and AFM states in Eu- and 
Gd-doped Bi2Se3, which could also be extended to other systems. 
The strong FM coupling in Eu-doped system is suggested to 
originate from the exchange coupling between Eu impurities via 
the intervening Se atoms. Because the partially occupied Eu state 
is above the VBM, the double exchange mechanism (i.e., the 
coupling between the d-d or f-f bands of the impurities) dominates 
in this configuration. In the FM states, the coupling between the 
impurity bands lowers the fully occupied majority-spin states [see 
Fig. 3(a), the outmost panels], which in turn couple to the 4p states 
(of the Se atoms) at the VBM. This coupling also raises the 
partially-occupied majority-spin impurity states near the Fermi 
level relative to the fully occupied majority-spin states [see Fig. 
3(a), the second outmost panels]. Then, coupling between the 
partially-occupied impurity states, across the impurities [see Fig. 
3(a), the middle panel] lowers the total energy of the system. In the 
AFM states, in contrast, coupling between the low-lying occupied 
 
majority-spin states [i.e., those in Fig. 3(b), the outmost panels] 
and the high-lying unoccupied minority-spin states in the 
conduction band takes place [see Fig. 3(b), the middle panel]. 
While such a coupling can also lower the total energy of the 
system, the exchange splitting between the majority and minority 
spins is quite large for 4f TM impurities, which counteracts and 
leads to a smaller energy gain. Therefore, the FM state is the 
ground state in Eu-doped Bi2Se3. This, however, does not happen 
in Gd-doped system, because the spin-up impurity states are deep 
inside the valence band. An FM coupling on fully occupied states 
cannot gain the system much energy. Instead, the AFM coupling 
will be more favorable. This rationale is supported by the 
calculated weak AFM state for Gd-doped Bi2Se3 in TABLE I, 
which is also supported by experiment25.  
Moreover, we noticed that Sm also favors a strong FM state, 
with a large magnetic moment of 5.06 µB, and a lower impurity 
formation energy than Eu. Also, the FM coupling strength in 
Sm-doped Bi2Se3 is 44 meV, even stronger than Eu. From a 
previous calculation by Chen et al.29, in conjunction with the 
calculated PDOS in Fig. 2 (e) for EuBi, we see that SmBi has an 
electronic structure similar to EuBi, but with one less f electron. 
The coupling between the lower-lying fully-occupied impurity 
bands and the higher-lying partially-occupied impurity bands with 
one less electron generally should lead to a larger energy gain. 
These results provide interpretation for the recent experiment 29, 
where stable FM state in 5% Sm-doped Bi2Se3 samples was 
observed at 52K. 
To realize QAHE in a TI, a successful magnetic doping 
requires that the as-doped system remains to be insulating, the 
dopants-induced magnetic moments align in the direction 
perpendicular to the quintuple layer, and that the magnetic dopants 
have a sufficient concentration to achieve long-range FM order. 
Therefore, to realize QAHE in Eu- or Sm-doped Bi2Se3, which is 
p-type, as revealed by Fig. 2 (e) in this paper and Fig. 5(c) in Ref. 
29, it is essential to be able to raise the Fermi level into the band 
gap. One possible strategy is to incorporate with the TM the right 
amount of n-type dopants, such as group VII anions or group IV 
cations. As such a codoping can also change the occupation of the f 
bands, the magnetic moments of the dopant, or the coupling 
strength between the FM and AFM states, its overall effect needs 
be addressed.

dash lines. SOC has been included in the calculation.

and (b) anti-ferromagnetic couplings in Eu-doped 
Bi2Se3.4 
We calculated the magnetic moment and the magnetic 
coupling strength for Eu codoped with the donors, which range 
from F to I for group VII elements, and Ge, Sn, and Pb for group 
IV elements. We found that EuBi, in general, has relatively larger 
magnetic moments but lower ferromagnetic coupling strength, 
when codoped with donors (see TABLE S1 in SI). It suggests that 
the FM coupling strength can be sensitive to charge compensation 
by the codopants, as a result of changing the occupancy of the Eu 
impurity bands. However, isolated donors cannot create magnetic 
moment in the absence of Eu, thus the enhanced magnetic moment 
cannot be interpreted in terms of the spin-spin interaction between 
the donors. Instead, we note that there is a charge transfer from the 
p states of the donors to the s, as well as the majority-spin f states 
of Eu. A larger occupation of the EuBi spin-up states results in the 
larger magnetic moment. On the down side, however, this charge 
transfer also leads to a larger occupation of the partially-occupied 
impurity states, whereby raising the total energy of the 
magnetically-coupled system and in turn lowering its coupling 
strength. This explains why the FM coupling strength of Eu is 
always lowered by codoping with donors. Nonetheless, the 
donor-compensated EuBi impurity still has a reasonably strong FM 
coupling strength above 20 meV, suggesting that the FM ground 
state of the Eu can be preserved, irrespective of the exact 
concentration of the co-dopant. This insensitivity is due to the fact 
that the exchange coupling is mediated by spin-polarized holes 
localized at the impurity states, subject to bounded magnetic 
polarons (BMPs)30-32. To verify this, we performed further 
calculations on a donor-compensated Sm impurity. The calculated 
FM coupling strength is also on the order of 20 meV, in line with 
the Eu results. In our view, however, SmBi may not be as promising 
as EuBi for realizing QAHE in Bi2Se3, because Sm has one less f 
electron than Eu, so two electron donors are needed to fully 
compensate one Sm. 
Finally, we need to address the issue of Bi2Se3 doping by Eu. 
The incorporation of Eu is expected to be more difficult than Cr, 
given that the calculated minimum formation energy for Eu is 0.54 
eV, which is significantly higher than that of Cr (about -0.25 eV)17. 
This, as we discussed earlier, can be understood in terms of the 
formation of competitive secondary phases and the energy position 
of the f bands. With the help of codoping, the +2 valence of Eu 
may be retained, yet a lower formation energy may also be 
achieved. In particular, the formation energy of Eu may be lowered 
by 0.02-0.30 eV when codoped with group IV cations, and may be 
lowered by 0.78-0.95 eV when codoped with group VII anions (see 
SI). This is due to the charge transfer from the donor's p states to 
Eu f states, which stabilizes the total energy of the doped system. 
Also, the formation energy of Eu generally can be lowered more 
when codoped with anions. A more significant reduction in the 
formation energy for the anion donors is because they have shorter 
distances to Eu, which is on the cation-Bi site. Thus, the anion 
donors can form a stronger binding with Eu due to Coulomb 
attraction, which is the strongest for F. After all, Eu is still slightly 
smaller than Bi. Hence, a compressive stress on the host can be 
beneficial for its incorporation. In this regard, F has the smallest 
atomic radius and is expected to bring in the largest local 
compression effect on the host to enhance Eu incorporation33. 
 In summary, our study reveals several 4f TMs as the 
promising magnetic dopants for long-range stable FM orders in 
Bi2Se3. In startle contrast to widely-used 3d TM impurities, the 
magnetic moments of the 4f dopants are high, while their 
interstitial populations are low. The FM for these impurities is 
unveiled as originated from the exchange coupling between the 
high-lying partially-occupied/unoccupied impurity bands and the 
low-lying fully occupied bands. Codoping of magnetic and 
non-magnetic impurities was also proposed as a means to tune the 
Fermi level position into the band gap and to reduce the formation 
energy of Eu inside Bi2Se3.
