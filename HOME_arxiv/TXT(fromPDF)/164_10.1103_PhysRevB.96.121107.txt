We report magnetotransport study on type-II Weyl semimetal WP2 single crystals. Magnetore-
sistance (MR) exhibits a nonsaturating Hn ﬁeld dependence (14,300% at 2 K and 9 T) whereas
systematic violation of Kohler’s rule was observed. Quantum oscillations reveal a complex multi-
band electronic structure. The cyclotron eﬀective mass close to the mass of free electron me was
observed in quantum oscillations along b-axis, while reduced eﬀective mass of about 0.5me was ob-
served in a-axis quantum oscillations, suggesting Fermi surface anisotropy. Temperature dependence
of the resistivity shows a large upturn that cannot be explained by the multi-band magnetoresis-
tance of conventional metals. Even though crystal structure of WP2 is not layered as in transition
metal dichalcogenides, quantum oscillations suggest partial two-dimensional character.

INTRODUCTION
Weyl fermions originate from Dirac states by break-
ing either time-reversal symmetry or space-inversion
symmetry.1–12 In addition to type-I3,6,10 Weyl points
with a close point-like Fermi surface, novel type-II4,11
Weyl fermions appear at the boundaries between elec-
tron and hole pockets violating Lorentz invariance. This
results in an open Fermi surface and anisotropic chiral
anomaly. Most of the reported type-II Weyl semimet-
als exhibit characteristic extraodinary magnetoresistance
(XMR), observed for example in materials that crystal-
lize in C2/m space group of OsGe2-type structure, such
as NbSb2, TaAs2, and NbAs2.13,14
WP2 crystallizes the nonsymmorphic space group
Cmc21(36), which favors new topological phases with
Dirac states.15–18 Indeed, WP2 was recently predicted
to be a type-II Weyl semimetal with four pairs of type-II
Weyl points and long topological Fermi arcs.19 In this
work, we have successfully grown single crystals of WP2,
and have investigated its magnetotransport properties.
Magnetoresistance (MR = [ρ(B) - ρ(0)]/ρ(0)×100%) ex-
hibits a nonsaturating ∼H1.8 ﬁeld dependence up to
14,300% at 2 K and 9 T. WP2 shows a systematic vi-
olation of Kohler’s rule and large magnetic ﬁeld-induced
nonmetallic resistivity that cannot be explained by or-
bital magnetoresistance of multiband metals. Fermi sur-
face studies of of WP2 by quantum oscillations reveal
complex electronic structure. The T −H phase diagram
is consistent with the universal phase diagram for ex-
traordinary magnetoresistance (XMR) materials,20 how-
ever the Weyl points in WP2 have little inﬂuence on the
eﬀective mass and mobility of the Fermi surfaces detected
by quantum oscillations.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Single crystals of WP2 were grown by chemical va-
por transport method using I2 as transport agent. First,
WP2 polycrystals were obtained by annealing stoichio-
metric W and P powder at 500 ◦C for 24 h, and then
750 ◦C for 48 h.
WP2 polycrystals were mixed with
I2 (15 mg/ml), and then sealed in an evacuated quartz
tube. Single crystals were grown in a temperature gra-
dient 1180 ◦C (source) to 1050 ◦C (sink) for a month.
Shiny needle-like single crystal with typical size 1.5 mm
× 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm were obtained. X-ray diﬀraction
(XRD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku
Miniﬂex powder diﬀractometer.
The element analysis
was performed using an energy-dispersive x-ray spec-
troscopy (EDX) in a JEOL LSM 6500 scanning electron
microscope. Heat capacity and magnetotransport mea-
surement up to 9 T were conducted in a Quantum Design
PPMS-9. Magnetotransport measurement at high mag-
netic ﬁelds up to 18 T were conducted at the National
High Magnetic Field Labortory (NHMFL) in Tallahas-
see.
Resistivity was measured using a standard four-
probe conﬁguration.
Hall resistivity was measured by
the four-terminal technique by switching the polarity of
the magnetic ﬁeld to eliminate the contribution of ρxx
due to the misalignment of the voltage contacts.2

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Figure 1(a) shows the powder X-ray diﬀraction pat-
tern of WP2. The data can be ﬁtted quite well by the
space group Cmc21 with lattice parameter a = 0.3164(2)
nm, b = 1.184(2) nm, and c = 0.4980(2) nm, consistent
with previous report.15 The average atomic ratio deter-
mined by the EDX is W: P = 1: 2. Figure 1(b) shows
the temperature dependence of resistivity in WP2 in dif-
ferent ﬁelds. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the
absence of magnetic ﬁeld is ρ(300K)/ρ(2K) = 279 with
ρ(2K) = 0.19 µΩcm, indicating small defect scattering
in the crystal. The metallic resistivity in H = 0 can be
described by the Bloch-Gr¨uneisen (BG) model:21

546(5) K. As shown in Fig. 1(b), with the application
of the magnetic ﬁeld, the ρ(T) shows a large upturn
which saturates below ∼15 K. Similar resistivity be-
haviour was observed recently in XMR materials such
as WTe2, TaAs, LaSb, PtSn4, ZrSiSe, Ta3S2, but also
in graphite, bismuth, and MgB2.22–31 Heat capacity of
WP2, shown in Fig. 1(c), is best described at low tem-
peratures with a C(T )/T = γ + βT 2 + δT 4 where γ =
1.50(5) mJ mol−1 K−1, β = 0.0324(5) mJ mol−1 K−2
and δ = 3.0(2) × 10−5 mJ mol−1 K−4 [Fig. 1(d)].32 The
Debye temperature ΘD = 564(±11) K is obtained from
ΘD = (12π4NR/5β)1/3 where N is the atomic number
in the chemical formula and R is the gas constant.
Based on the ﬁeld dependence of ∂ρ/∂T [Fig. 1(e)] we
plot the temperature-ﬁeld (T −H) phase diagram in Fig.
1(f), where Tm and Ti are taken as the sign change point
and minimum in ∂ρ/∂T . The phase diagram is consistent
with extreme magnetoresistance materials.20
Figure 2(a) shows the ﬁeld dependence of transverse
magnetoresistance MR = [ρ(B) - ρ(0)]/ρ(0)×100% at
various temperatures with B//b.
MR exhibits a non-
saturating ∼H1.8 dependence and reaches 14,300% at 2
K and 9 T. It decreases quickly with increasing tempera-
ture, and becomes negligibly small above 100 K. The MR
of WP2 is about one order of magnitude smaller than
in WTe2 and LaSb, but comparable even larger than
those in LaBi, Ta3S2, and TaIrTe4.22–25,33 The MR of
solids only responds to the extremal cross section of the
Fermi surface along the ﬁeld direction.
Thus, angular

should be proportional to |cos(θ)|.34 As shown in Fig.
2(b), MR in diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds show two fold sym-
metry which can be ﬁtted well with |cos(θ)|, indicating a
2D Fermi surface.
Field induced nonmetallic resistivity and XMR in
topological materials has been discussed lately in the lit-
erature; however its origin was ascribed to diﬀerent mech-
anisms. In WTe2 it was suggested that the band struc-
ture of a compensated semimetal with perfect electron-
hole symmetry is important whereas in LaBi and LaSb
the proposed mechanism involves a combination of com-
pensated electron-hole pockets and particular orbital tex-
ture on the electron pocket.20,35–38 There are also ev-
idences for exotic and multiple surface Dirac states in
other materials.
MR in PtSn4 has been considered
within the model of orbital MR in the long mean-free
path metals with single dominant scattering time.28 How-
ever, Dirac node arcs are also found in PtSn4 and Zr-
SiSe(Te), suggesting that XMR could be connected with
suppressed backscattering of Dirac states.39,40
Semiclassical transport theory based on the Boltzmann
equation predicts Kohler’s rule ∆ρ/ρ(0) = F[H/ρ(0)] to
hold if there is a single type of charge carrier and scat-
tering time in a metal.41 Violation of Kohler’s rule is
common in XMR materials, such as LaBi, TaAs, TaAs2,
NbAs2, NbSb2.13,14,23,42 As shown in Fig.2(c), MR in
WP2 systematically deviates from Kohler’s rule above
10 K. The ﬁeld dependence of MR at diﬀerent tempera-
ture can be well ﬁtted with MR = A × Hn, n is 1.8 at 2
K. The exponent n systematically decreases to 1.5 with
increasing temperature, as shown in Fig.2(d). The tem-
perature evolutions of A and n are similar to temperature
dependence of MR(9T).

A common violation of Kohler’s rule in metals is multi-
band electronic transport i.e. existence of multiple scat-
tering times. WP2 was predicted to be a type-II Weyl
semimetal; therefore there is a possibility that high mo-
bility bands with Dirac states contribute to small residual
resistivity in zero magnetic ﬁeld and strong magnetore-
sistance. In the two-band model MR is:43
MR =
neµenhµh(µe+µh)2(µ0H)2
(µenh+µhne)2+(µhµe)2(µ0H)2(nh−ne)2
For the compensated semimetal, where ne ≃nh, we
obtain MR = µeµh(µ0H)2. Since MR = A × Hn (n =
1.5-1.8) [Fig. 2(c)] compensated two band model can-
not completely explain the MR. Next, we discuss elec-
tronic transport in WP2 from the perspective of two-band
model when ne ̸= nh.4
Figure 3(a) shows the ﬁeld dependence of Hall resistiv-
ity ρxy at diﬀerent temperatures. Clear quantum oscilla-
tion were observed at low temperatures. The frequencies
and eﬀective mass derived from ρxy are consistent with
that of ρxx, and we discuss this below. The ρxy can be
ﬁtted by two band model:
ρxy
µ0H = RH = 1
e
(µ2
hnh−µ2
ene)+(µhµe)2(µ0H)2(nh−ne)
(µenh+µhne)2+(µhµe)2(µ0H)2(nh−ne)2
Where ne (nh) and µe (µh) denote the carrier con-
centrations and mobilities of electron and hole, respec-
tively. We ﬁnd that ρxy can be well ﬁtted by the two-
band model. The obtained ne (nh) and µe (µh) by ﬁt-
ting are shown in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively. WP2
shows relatively high carrier density and the dominant
carrier is electron-like. The mobility is similar to other
Dirac materials such as AMnBi2 (A = Sr,Ca), LaBi and
doped WTe2.23,44–46 The large carrier density indicates
that WP2 is diﬀerent from a compensated semimetal.
We calculate the ρ (T, B) using carrier concentrations ne
(nh) and mobilities µe (µh) obtained by two band model
ﬁtting of ρxy, as shown in in Fig.3(d). A similar temper-
ature dependence between calculated and measured MR
argues in favor of the validity of multicarrier electronic
transport [Fig.
3(d)].
However, in contrast to LaBi,
the ρ (T, B) from two-band orbital magnetoresistance is
several orders of magnitude smaller than the measured
ρ (T, B). When considering the multi-band behavior fur-
ther ﬁts of ρxy using three-band model47 reproduced ρxy
equally well. Moreover, nearly identical MR is obtained.
Therefore, in either case multiband MR is much smaller
than experiment results. This suggests possible contribu-
tion beyond the conventional orbital magnetoresistance
that ampliﬁes MR.
MR for H//b, and cantilver for H//a at diﬀerent tem-
peratures up to 18 T are shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b).
MR shows non-saturating Hn up to 18 T, consistent with
result in Fig. 2. Clear oscillations were observed above 10
T. The oscillatory components are plotted as a function
of 1/B in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d). Both Fig. 4(c) and 4(d)
exhibit beat patterns, indicating that multiple frequen-
cies contribute to oscillations. The fast Fourier transform
(FFT) spectra of the oscillatory components are shown
in Fig. 4(e) and 4(f). Four frequencies are observed in
Fig. 4(e): 1384 T, 1799 T, 3183 T, and 3806 T. There
are several peaks around Fα = 1384 T, suggesting con-
tribution of several extrema. According the calculated
Fermi surface of WP2,19,48 Fα = 1384 T, and Fβ = 1799
T can be ascribed to hole pockets, and Fγ = 3183 T, and
Fη = 3806 T are from electron pockets.
From the Onsager relation, F = (Φ0/2π2)AF , where
Φ0 is the ﬂux quantum and AF is the orthogonal cross-
sectional area of the Fermi surface, the Fermi surface
is estimated to be 13 nm−2, 17 nm−2, 30 nm−2, and 36
nm−2, corresponding to 5%, 7%, 12%, and 14% of the to-
tal area of the Brillouin zone in the ac plane. Assuming
the circular cross section of Fermi surface AF = πk2
F , the
band splitting induced by spin-orbital coupling can be

estimated to be kγ - kη = 0.03 ˚A−1, which is larger than
that in MoP, and about half of that in giant Rashba eﬀect
material BiTeI.49,50 Strong spin-orbital coupling in WP2
indicates that spin texture, which could forbid backscat-
tering, might play an important role in large magnetore-
sistance, similar to that in WTe2.51 For dHvA oscillation
along a axis, the Fermi surfaces from three frequencies
1217 T, 2949 T, and 3417 T are 12 nm−2, 28 nm−2, and
32 nm−2, corresponding to 18%, 42%, and 48% of the
Brillouin zone.
In
order
to
obtain
the
cyclotron
mass
for
the
main frequencies, the FFT amplitude A versus tem-5
perature was ﬁtted using Lifshitz-Kosevich formula,34
A∼[αm∗(T/B)/sinh(α m∗T/B)] where α = 2π2kB/eℏ≈
14.69 T/K, m∗= m/me is the cyclotron mass ratio (me
is the mass of free electron). As shown in Fig. 4(e) and
4(f), the cyclotron mass along b axis is close to the mass
of free electron me, while cyclotron mass along a axis
is reduced to about 0.5me, which can be attributed to
anisotropy of the Fermi surface. We estimate the Din-
gle temperatures from the FFT frequency with highest
FFT peaks to be 2.4 K and 4.7 K for H//b and H//a, re-
spectively. The corresponding scattering times are 5.0 ×
10−13 s and 2.6 × 10−13 s. Then, the mobility estimated
by µq = eτq/mc is 880 cm2V−1s−1 and 458 cm2V−1s−1,
comparable to Fig. 3(c). The eﬀective mass and mobil-
ity suggest that the Fermi surfaces detected by quantum
oscillation are not under signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the due
the the Weyl points which are located below the Fermi
level.19
Angle dependence of SdH in bc plane, and dHvA in ab
plane provides further insight into the shape of the Fermi
surface. The FFT spectra of the SdH is presented in Fig.
5 (a), and dHvA in Fig. 5(b). For the SdH measurement,
four main peaks are observed, the FFT peaks increases
with the angle tilt from zero, and disappear above 60o.
Solid lines in Fig.5(c) are ﬁtted using 2D Fermi surface
[F(0)/cos(θ)]. Hence low angle quantum oscillations re-
veal quasi-2D character at low angles below 50o. When
the ﬁeld is rotated in the ab plane, with the ﬁeld titled
from a axis, the frequency decreases with the angle, indi-
cating the enlongated Fermi surface in the bc plane. The
angle dependence of quantum oscillations agree well with
the calculated Fermi surface.19,48 The calculated Fermi
surfaces of WP2 consist of spaghetti-like hole Fermi sur-
faces and bow-tie-like electron Fermi surfaces, while the
presence of strong spin-orbit coupling leads to splitting
of Fermi surfaces.19,48 The spaghetti-like hole Fermi sur-
face extends along b axis, bends along a axis, while it is
ﬂat along c axis, consistent with the quasi-2D enlonged
α and β bands in bc plane. When magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied in small angles around b axis, SdH oscillations of
γ and η bands are from the orbits across whole electron
pockets in ac plane, quasi-2D behavior of γ and η bands
can be then attributed to relatively ﬂat wall of electron
pockets. Moreover, the appearance in pair of both the
hole and electron Fermi surfaces with almost same angle
dependence might be the result of band splitting eﬀect
which is induced by strong spin orbit coupling.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, magnetotransport studies of WP2 con-
ﬁrm the presence of multiple bands.19 The large increase
of resistivity in magnetic ﬁeld cannot be explained by
the multiband orbital magnetoresistance but the eﬀec-
tive mass and mobility detected by quantum oscilllations
are not under signiﬁcant inﬂuence of Weyl points. Strong
spin-orbit coupling eﬀect was observed in dHvA whereas
the temperature and angle dependence of dHvA measure-
ments reveal anisotropic multiband characteristics and
are in agreement with calculations. Even though crystal
structure in WP2 is not layered as in transition metal
dichalcogenides, Fermi surfaces do show partial quasi-2D
character.

Note added. During the review of this paper, a related
study on WP2 was reported by R. Sch¨onemann et al.,52
though the magnitude of magnetoresistance and RRR of
the crystal is somewhat diﬀerent, the Fermi surface and
main conclusion is consistent with ours.
