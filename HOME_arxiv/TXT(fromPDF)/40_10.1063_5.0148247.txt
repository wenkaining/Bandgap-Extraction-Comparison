Abstract 
The diffusion of small molecular penetrants through polymeric materials represents an important 
fundamental problem, relevant to the design of materials for applications such as coatings and 
membranes. Polymer networks hold promise in these applications, because dramatic differences 
in molecular diffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this paper, we 
use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked network polymers have in 
governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By considering the local, activated alpha relaxation 
time of the penetrant and its long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative 
importance of activated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale versus entropic mesh 
confinement on penetrant diffusion.  We vary several parameters, such as the crosslinking density, 
temperature, and penetrant size, to show that crosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion 
through modification of the matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially 
coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is very sensitive to the 
local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding matrix, and we also show that penetrant 
transport is affected by dynamic heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high 
temperatures and for large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak does the2 
effect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion more broadly 
empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh confinement-based transport.  
Introduction 
The diffusive transport of molecular species through polymers is an important fundamental 
problem, with the motion of small ‘penetrants’ being integral to the design of polymer materials 
for a variety of applications. For example, barrier coatings,1–3 drug delivery vehicles,4,5 and self-
healing microcapsules1,2,6 may be engineered to impede the transport of penetrants, while 
membranes are often designed to selectively separate or filter specific small penetrants (e.g. gas,7–
10 water,11–13 or organic molecules14,15). Membrane separations represent an especially important 
materials design challenge,7,15 due to significant interest in finding promising alternatives to 
distillation for chemical separations. One strategy is to impose control over pore size in materials 
such as zeolites,16 metal organic frameworks,17,18 and covalent organic frameworks;19 however, 
these materials have issues with mechanical properties and scalability.16–19 If the molecular 
penetrants are especially small, such as in gas separations, then glassy amorphous polymers can 
be another option for membranes.8–10 These materials are more mechanically robust, but despite 
important insights from atomistic simulations and phenomenological models,20–23 they are limited 
to small gas molecules and do not have the same size-selectivity as more precise matrix 
structures.8–10  
Highly-crosslinked networks have recently emerged as a promising option for the selective 
transport of small molecules,24–26 exploiting the sensitivity of penetrant diffusion to the near-𝑇𝑔 
coupling between the structural relaxation of the dense molecular mesh and activated hopping 
processes. This is motivated by experimental support for the premise that, despite significant 
molecular disorder, dense polymer networks can discern small changes in penentrant size and3 
interactions.25 Design of crosslinked networks for selective transport requires an understanding of 
how the molecular-scale dynamics of penetrant and matrix relaxation contribute to large-scale 
diffusive motion. Aspects of this problem have been studied in the literature. For example, there 
has been extensive work on studying particle transport through polymer solutions or high-
temperature networks,27–33 which is understood to be governed by a confinement parameter 𝐶=
𝑑/𝑎𝑥 that relates the penetrant size 𝑑 to the size of the network mesh 𝑎𝑥. This parameter quantifies 
the extent to which the surrounding polymer matrix sterically ‘traps’ the particle, such that the 
particle diffusion is an activated process where the network strands must entropically stretch to 
allow the particle to hop out of its location within the mesh.27 Several expressions for the diffusion 
constant have been considered in the literature, such as the expression proposed by Cai, et al.:27 
 
𝐷𝑝∼𝑑2
𝜏𝐶−1 exp(−𝑏𝐶2) = 𝑑2
𝜏𝑋 
(1) 
This relates the diffusion constant 𝐷𝑝 to the confinement parameter 𝐶, a length scale characterized 
by the penetrant size 𝑑, a time scale 𝜏 that Cai, et al. identify as the Rouse time of the network 
strand, and a constant 𝑏 of order unity.27 While there are other candidate models,30 these still 
exhibit a general form given in the second equivalence of Equation 1 as the product of two factors; 
a quantity proportional to the elementary particle diffusion 𝑑2 𝜏
⁄  and a factor 𝑋 dictated by the 
network mesh and related to 𝐶 (in the case above, 𝑋= exp(−𝑏𝐶2) /𝐶). Simulations of large 
penetrants in rubbery networks are consistent with this physical picture;28,29,34 however, the choice 
of 𝜏 can become non-trivial as temperature is lowered for polymer melts and/or when the glass 
transition is approached.35 For example, in uncrosslinked systems activated transport of penetrants 
becomes dominated by molecular caging and correlated matrix elasticity effects near the glass 
transition.35–384 
 
For tight and supercooled near-𝑇𝑔 networks, the physical relationship in Equation 1 is 
complicated by recent experimental, simulation, and theoretical investigations by the authors and 
collaborators demonstrating that the structural relaxation in polymer networks is strongly 
dependent on the extent of crosslinking, manifesting as a monotonic increase in the material 𝑇𝑔 
with crosslink density.39 In this case, the time scale 𝜏 in Equation 1 is expected to depend on 
molecular penetrant caging, which itself will be sensitive to the confinement parameter 𝐶 due to 
its relationship with the crosslink density of the polymer network. Crosslinks could thus impact 
penetrant motion both by affecting the structural relaxation of the surrounding network as well as 
providing a confining mesh that obstructs penetrant motion. Our recent work demonstrated using 
a combination of theory, experiment, and simulation that there exists a degeneracy of 
interpretations for crosslink effects on penetrant transport between these two mechanisms, noting 
the need to further clarify the molecular origin of this observation.40 
In this article, we use computer simulation to study the diffusion and structural relaxation 
of penetrants in dense, highly-crosslinked polymer networks in the computationally accessible 
weakly-supercooled regime. Simulation will allow us to separate out the different ways that 
crosslinks contribute to penetrant diffusion, by quantifying both the overall diffusion constant 𝐷𝑝 
and the characteristic time scale of penetrant hopping 𝜏 in Equation 1, which we identify with a 
penetrant alpha relaxation time 𝜏𝛼,𝑝 determined from an appropriate time correlation function as 
discussed below. By relating particle hopping events to long-time diffusive motion, we can study 
how these properties are affected by both crosslinking fraction and temperature. We determine that 
(1) supercooled networks exhibit strong coupling between the network segmental relaxation and 
penetrant hopping, with sensitivity to the crosslinking-dependent 𝑇𝑔, (2) increasing temperature 
can lead to slower diffusion at a given 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 due to the dependence of 𝑇𝑔 on crosslink density, but5 
this is mostly attributed to a non-trivial 𝑇 dependence of how local polymer relaxations couple to 
penetrant motion, (3) the coupling between penetrant motion and polymer relaxation processes is 
dependent on penetrant size 𝑑, and (4) penetrant hopping is correlated with long-time diffusion at 
several values of 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 near 𝑇= 𝑇𝑔, but the mesh confinement only becomes apparent at high 𝑇 
and for large penetrants. This all leads to the overall insight that, under typical conditions for 
polymer networks and molecular penetrants, crosslinking primarily affects penetrant transport by 
changing the effective 𝑇𝑔 and segmental relaxation time of the surrounding matrix and only 
secondarily through mesh confinement. Serendipitously, this still manifests in a similar 
relationship between the diffusion constant 𝐷𝑝 and 𝐶 that is consistent with the form in Equation 
1.27,30 These molecular-level insights into penetrant diffusion and hopping clarify the fundamental 
mechanisms governing penetrant transport and help identify ways in which both temperature and 
network architecture can be used to engineer selectivity into a promising class of membrane 
materials.  
We also briefly discuss at a high level how the theoretical results in our compansion paper41 
qualitatively compare to our present simulations. The goal is not to quantitatively use simulation 
to test the theory, especially since the polymer and penetrant models, and range of temperatures 
explored, are not the same. Rather, the present work and the theoretical companion paper are meant 
to be complementary with regards to addressing the scientific problems of interest. 
Simulation Methods 
We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to model the diffusion of 
spherical penetrants in crosslinked polymer networks,42 using well-established methods for 
studying polymers near the glass transition.43–46 Our system is initially composed of 𝑁c = 20 
linear chains with 𝑁m = 30 beads each with diameter 𝜎, modeled as standard semiflexible chains.6 
These beads are placed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions, 
along with 𝑁p spherical penetrants of diameter 𝑑̃. The number of penetrants 𝑁p depends on 𝑑̃, and 
is chosen so that the volume fraction of the penetrant 𝜙𝑝=
𝜋𝑑3𝑁𝑝
6𝑉 is kept below  𝜙𝑝= 0.01 to 
ensure that the addition of penetrants will not affect network dynamics and to prevent significant 
interactions between penetrant molecules.  
Standard dimensionless simulation quantities are employed,42,47 and denoted with tildes 
(e.g. 𝑇̃ = 𝑇/𝑇∗). Quantities are rendered dimensionless by several characteristic values: lengths 
are related to the bead diameter 𝜎, energies are related to the thermal energy at a reference 
temperature 𝑘𝐵𝑇∗, and times are related to a time scale 𝜏∗= √𝑚𝜎2/𝑘𝐵𝑇∗, where  𝑚 is the 
monomer mass. The characteristic temperature 𝑇∗ corresponds to 485K, which is determined 
from parametrization against experiments,39 using crosslinked poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) as a 
representative polymer that has been studied by our experimental collaborators (see details in ref. 
35). 
Our MD simulations consider standard potentials for coarse-grained bead-spring 
polymers,48 including a Lennard-Jones potential 𝑈̃LJ between all non-bonded beads, and both 
bonding 𝑈̃B and bending 𝑈̃𝜃 potentials to model each semiflexible bead-spring chain. The overall 
energy is composed of a sum of these contributions:

Here the total system energy is written in terms of independent pairwise contributions 𝑢̃B,α,𝑖, 𝑢̃𝜃,𝛼,𝑖, 
and 𝑢̃LJ,𝛼𝛽,𝑖𝑗. Bonded monomers interact through harmonic bonding potential:7 
 
𝑢̃B,𝑖𝑗= 𝑘̃

2Θ𝑖𝑗 
(3) 
A large spring constant 𝑘̃ = 2000 is adopted to enforce the equilibrium distance 𝑟̃𝑖𝑗= 1 between 
bonded beads 𝑖 and 𝑗. The factor Θ𝑖𝑗 determines the connectivity between monomer pairs, with 
Θ𝑖𝑗= 1 being connected and Θ𝑖𝑗= 0 being disconnected; these values depend on the specific 
network that is formed. A bending energy is similarly introduced to account for chain stiffness: 
 
𝑢̃𝜃,𝑖𝑗𝑘= 𝑘̃𝜃[1 −cos𝜃𝑖𝑗𝑘]Θ𝑖𝑗𝑘 
(4) 
Here, the bond angle is between three adjacent beads 𝑖, 𝑗, and 𝑘 whose connectivity is determined 
by a similar factor Θ𝑖𝑗𝑘 to the one used for the bonding potential. The bending constant 𝑘̃𝜃= 1.52 
is selected to reflect the experimental Kuhn length of PnBA.49–52 Further details of the 
parametrization are given in the literature.39 A Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is used to describe all 
non-bonded interactions between particles 𝑖 and 𝑗 on species 𝛼 and 𝛽: 
 
𝑢̃LJ,𝛼𝛽,𝑖𝑗= {4𝜖̃𝛼𝛽[(

Here, 𝛼, 𝛽∈{n, p}, denotes the species as either network (n) or penetrant (p), with n denoting the 
monomer bead in the network and p denotes the penetrant. In the overall summation, 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑛=
𝑁𝐶𝑁𝑚 is the total number of network beads and 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑝= 𝑁𝑝 is the total number of penetrant beads. 
The monomer size 𝑑̃n = 1 is always unity (i.e., 𝑑n = 𝜎) and the penetrant size 𝑑̃p ≡𝑑̃ is an 
important parameter for this study. In this study, we do not consider specific penetrant-polymer 
attractions, so we set 𝜖̃nn = 𝜖̃np = 𝜖̃pp = 1.8 
 
Figure 1. (a) Schematic illustrating the setup of our simulation. Monomer beads (orange) and 
crosslinker beads (blue) interact via bonding (𝑢̃B,𝑖𝑗) and angle (𝑢̃𝜃,𝑖𝑗𝑘) potentials, and can interact 
with each other and with the penetrant through Lennard-Jones potentials (𝑢̃LJ,𝑖𝑗). Monomer and 
crosslinker beads have a diameter 𝑑̃𝑛= 1 and the penetrant has a diameter 𝑑̃𝑝. Crosslinking occurs 
during an initial simulation step where ‘reactive’ beads (light blue) will form bonds with regular 
monomers within a cutoff distance 𝑅̃min. (b) Snapshot of a typical simulation, for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0 and 
𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠= 0.11.  
 
The system is first equilibrated at 𝑇̃ = 1, 𝑃̃ = 0, and then networks are prepared by 
crosslinking the linear chains with reactive beads randomly distributed along the chain.39,53,54 The 
total number of reactive beads is 𝑁r = 𝑓r𝑁m𝑁c, where 𝑓r is the fraction of reactive beads which 
tunes the crosslink density of networks. If the distance between a reactive bead and a free bead 
(orange beads in Figure 1) is within 𝑅̃min = 1.1, a new permanent bond will be formed given an 
assigned probability. Once a reactive bead forms a bond with a free bead, both the reactive bead 
and the free bead are labeled as crosslink beads (dark blue beads in Figure 1) and these two beads 
represent one crosslink ‘molecule’, in a way that reflects the specific chemistry used to synthesize 
PnBA networks,25 where the crosslinker molecular weight is roughly twice of the molecular weight 
of nBA. Crosslinking reactions were turned off once every reactive bead has formed a new bond 
with another free monomer (maximum number of possible bonds has been reached). In the end,9 
𝑁r reactive beads have reacted with the 𝑁r free beads and resulting in 2𝑁r crosslink beads 
associated with 𝑁r crosslink molecules. The crosslink density, 𝑓cross, of networks is defined as:39 
 
𝑓cross =
𝑛crosslink
𝑛crosslink + 𝑛monomer
=
𝑁r
𝑁m𝑁c −𝑁r
 
(6) 
Here, 𝑛crosslink  and 𝑛monomer   are the number of crosslink molecules and nBA monomers, 
respectively. Four values of crosslink fraction 𝑓cross are considered: 0.11, 0.25, 0.36, and 0.5.  
After crosslinking, the system is cooled to a target temperature at a cooling rate 𝛤̃ =
8.3 × 10−6 (corresponding to 𝛤= 1.25 × 109 K/s in experimental units) and further equilibrated 
at constant 𝑃̃ = 0. Another short NPT run was performed and the mean volume 𝑉 is measured. 
We then switch to a NVT ensemble by setting the system volume to the mean volume 𝑉 and 
equilibrate the system before final production run at NVT. All simulations are performed in 
LAMMPS55 with a standard Nosé-Hoover thermostat and extended ensemble barostat,42,56,57and 
all observables were averaged over five independent simulation trajectories. 
The polymer network is characterized by its mesh size (𝑎̃𝑥), Kuhn segment alpha relaxation 
time (𝜏̃𝛼,K), and glass transition temperature Tg. The mesh size of networks at different crosslink 
densities is defined as the averaged distance between two adjacent crosslink beads on the same 
chain, and is tabulated in Table S1. The value of 𝜏̃𝛼,K at each temperature and crosslink density 
was defined as the time where the temporal autocorrelation function of a Kuhn monomer vector, 
𝐶𝜆(𝑡̃) = 〈𝑃2(𝒓̃3(𝑡̃) ∙𝒓̃3(0))〉 decays to 𝐶𝜆(𝑡̃max) + (1 −𝐶𝜆(𝑡̃max)) 𝑒
⁄ , where 𝐶𝜆(𝑡̃max) represents 
the plateau value at the long-time limit 𝑡̃max.58–62 Here, 𝑃2 is the second Legendre polynomial and 
𝒓̃3 is a vector between two beads that are 3 bonds apart which reflects the choice of coarse-grained 
bead relate to Kuhn segment of PnBA. 𝑇g is then defined as when the Kuhn segment alpha 
relaxation time is 𝜏̃𝛼,K(𝑇̃g) = 105. More information can be found in our previous work.3910
We characterize the dynamics of the penetrant motion by its alpha relaxation time, 𝜏̃𝛼,p, 
and its diffusion coefficient 𝐷𝑝. To calculate 𝜏̃𝛼,p, we use the self-intermediate scattering function 
(ISF) of the penetrant, which is given by:59 
 
𝐹𝑠(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) = 1
𝑁𝑝
∑⟨exp [−𝑖𝒒̃ ∙(𝒓̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡̃) −𝒓̃𝑝𝑗(0))]⟩
𝑁𝑝
𝑗
 
(7) 
where 𝒓̃𝑝𝑗 is the position of the 𝑗th penetrant at time 𝑡̃, and |𝒒̃| is set to the position of the first peak 
of the static structure factor for the networks, corresponding to |𝒒̃| = 7.2. The value of 𝜏̃𝛼,p, is 
defined as the time required for 𝐹𝑠(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) to decay to either 1/𝑒 or 0.1 from its initial (𝑡̃ = 0) value 
of unity. We characterize the mean-squared displacement (MSD) as a function of time: MSD(𝑡̃) =

Results and Discussion 
Penetrant Hopping and Transport in Dense Networks 
We first characterize the diffusive motion of penetrants in polymer networks by studying 
the mean square displacement, ⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩, of both small (𝑑/𝜎= 1.0) and large (𝑑/𝜎= 2.0) 
penetrants. These two particle sizes are representative of experimental systems used in previous 
work by some of the authors;26 the network polymer PnBA is coarse-grained so that 𝜎= 0.573nm, 
and hence 𝑑𝜎
⁄
∼1 −2  spans the typical size of molecular penetrants.26 This choice also 
corresponds to the general length scale of the mesh size in the literature,25,64 which here ranges 
size from 𝑎̃𝑥∼1.3 −2.5 (see Table S1) such that the size ratio range spans 𝐶= 𝑑𝑎𝑥
⁄
= 0.4 −
1.5. The MSD versus time 𝑡̃ is plotted for both particle sizes in Figures 2a and 2b for 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0 
and 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0, respectively, varying both the crosslink density 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 and temperature. These11
plots show typical features characteristic of molecular diffusion. At short times, the particle 
exhibits ballistic motion such that the MSD scales as ⟨𝑟̃𝑝2(𝑡̃)⟩∼𝑡̃2; however, this regime gives 
way to a subdiffusive regime that we attribute to molecular caging by neighboring network 
monomers. At long times, the particle can overcome the kinetic constraints imposed by these 
cages, along with any constraints due to the network mesh, and undergo Fickian diffusion where 
⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩∼𝑡̃1. These general features of diffusive motion are observed for both penetrant sizes and 
all crosslink densities and temperatures, however the specifics of penetrant caging and diffusive 
motion will be affected by these parameters.  
The onset of the subdiffusive regime following the initial, ballistic penetrant motion 
provides insight into the time scales of caging, and large differences in the persistence of this 
regime are observed as 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠, 𝑇, and 𝑑/𝜎 are varied. To characterize this regime, we plot in 
Figure S1 the slope of the log⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩ versus log𝑡̃  curve on a log-log plot ( 𝛽=
𝑑log⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩𝑑log 𝑡̃
⁄
) as a function of time 𝑡̃. The minimum value of 𝛽 is an estimate for the time 
𝑡̃𝛽 at which the penetrant is maximally subdiffusive or caged, and the value of ⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃𝛽)⟩
1/2 
correspondingly quantifies a transient localization length. A representative quantity is indicated in 
Figures 2a and 2b with an open square, showing the caging onset for 𝑇= 300 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠= 0.11. 
We only indicate a single representative value for each particle size, because the displacement 
⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃𝛽)⟩
1/2 is only weakly dependent on temperature and crosslink densities, and is far smaller 
than the length scale of the penetrant diameter ( ⟨𝑟̃𝑝2(𝑡̃𝛽)⟩
1/2 ∼0.22  for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1  and 
⟨𝑟̃𝑝2(𝑡̃𝛽)⟩
1/2 ∼0.32 for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2). This insensitivity leads us to interpret this onset of caging as 
tied to the structural correlations of the surrounding melt beads.12
For both small (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1) and large (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2) penetrants, the value of 𝛽→1 at long times 
corresponds to Fickian behavior, however the time that it takes to reach this limit increases with 
decreasing temperature (Figure 2 and Figure S1). This is the expected result of having less thermal 
energy to overcome a dynamic caging barrier,24,65 especially as our simulations approach the 𝑇𝑔. 
Similarly, an increase of crosslink density 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 monotonically increases the length of this 
subdiffusive regime and the minimum value of 𝛽 concomitantly decreases (Figure S1) so that the 
MSD nearly exhibits a transient plateau. In principle, this is due to some combination of (1) an 
increase in the caging barrier because of the concomitant increase in the segmental relaxation time 
(cage lifetime) due to crosslinks39 and (2) the impact of mesh confinement impeding penetrant 
motion.27,28,30 In this paper, a major result will be to show that the first interpretation is the 
dominant determinant of penetrant mobility for the models studied, especially as 𝑇𝑔 is approached. 
This is apparent already by comparing the features in the MSD versus 𝑡̃ to the mesh size 𝑎̃𝑥, which 
are tabulated in Table S1 for several different values of 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 and indicated in Figures 2 and S1 
as open circles. This length scale is often only accessed in or near the Fickian regime, suggesting 
that any effect of the geometric mesh on the subdiffusive transport of the penetrant in these 
simulations is subtle and not readily apparent from the MSD versus 𝑡̃ plot alone. Despite this 
observation, it is apparent that both the temperature and crosslink density effects still depend on 
the penetrant size, with more pronounced changes in the subdiffusive regime for the larger (𝑑𝜎
⁄
=
2) penetrants than the smaller (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1) penetrants as 𝑇 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 are varied.13
 
Figure 2. Mean square displacement ⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩ versus time 𝑡̃ of a penetrant particle with sizes (a) 
𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0, for several values of 𝑇 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠. Open squares denote a 
representative location for the onset of caging or transient localization, defined as the minimum 
slope 𝛽 on this plot (see Figure S1) and chosen for 𝑇= 300K and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠= 0.11. The analogous 
point for other values of 𝑇 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 would be almost identical. The open circles denote the length 
scale of the polymer network mesh size, as described in Table S1. The long-time data Fickian 
region, where the slope of this plot 𝛽= 1, is used to determine the penetrant diffusion constant 
𝐷̃𝑝. 
 
The MSD provides a molecular measure of penetrant transport, with the long-time Fickian 
regime allowing determination of the macroscopic diffusion coefficient 𝐷̃𝑝 of the penetrant. 
However, this quantity (𝐷̃𝑝) is determined by, in principle, the cumulative effect of both local 
particle motions as well as any larger length-scale effects of the network mesh confinement on 
transport. To deconvolute these contributions, we also consider the time evolution of the self-ISF 
𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) in Figure 3. Here we select a value |𝒒̃| = 7.2 that is chosen to reflect the local structural 
cage of the polymer network and not the length scale of the network mesh. The curves shown in 
Figure 3 thus primarily account for the dynamics of local relaxation and hopping, and quantify 
the extent to which the penetrant remains within its original cage as a function of time. The first 
part of this decay is independent of temperature and crosslinking; this corresponds to the initial14
ballistic motion of the penetrant observed in Figure 2, and may include contributions from partial 
fast relaxations due to a distribution of network alpha times associated with dynamic 
heterogeneity.66 There are some subtle differences between the different penetrant sizes (𝑑𝜎
⁄
=
1.0 vs. 2.0) that we attribute to the different masses of the penetrants and is also apparent in Figure 
2.  
At longer times, the decay of 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃)  becomes strongly dependent on temperature, 
crosslinking, and penetrant size in a manner consistent with the diffusive motion in Figure 2. At 
high temperatures, the smaller penetrant (Figure 3a) exhibits a non-exponential, long time decay 
of 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) that we attribute to an activated, but relatively rapid, hopping process for penetrant 
relaxation. As crosslinking increases, this long-time decay extends further, and its non-exponential 
character becomes more pronounced. This trend is exacerbated by going to lower temperatures. 
We find there is a significant slowing down of penetrant motion even at intermediate times; this 
occurs around 𝑡̃ ∼1, which is roughly when the minimum in the apparent exponent 𝛽 occurs for 
the MSD curves (in Figure 2 and S1) and is consistent with the interpretation of this as a state of 
maximal transient penetrant caging. For larger penetrants (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0, Figure 3b) this slowing 
down leads to the near transient arrest of particle motion, again at 𝑡̃ ∼1, as evidenced by a plateau 
in 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) that only begins to relax at significantly longer times as the temperature is decreased or 
crosslinking fraction is increased. In both cases, we can attribute this arrest to the coupling of 
penetrant hopping to the slow segmental relaxation dynamics of the surrounding polymer 
segments, as 𝐹s(𝐪, 𝑡̃) is a local measure of relaxation that does not directly probe the length scales 
relevant for mesh confinement. We note the penetrant hopping should also be significantly affected 
by the crosslinking degree, although indirectly, since crosslinking has strong influence on the slow 
segmental relaxation dynamics of the surrounding polymer segments.3915
The trends seen in the intermediate scattering function plots in Figure 3 are largely 
consistent with those of the MSD plots in Figure 2, however we note several important differences 
that we will use to understand the mechanisms of penetrant motion in polymer networks. First, we 
note the similarity of the MSD versus time plots in Figure 2a for low temperatures and crosslink 
density (𝑇= 300K and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠= 0.11) and the high temperatures and crosslink density (𝑇=
339K and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠= 0.36); these curves almost overlap, and exhibit essentially the same diffusive 
properties. Yet, the shapes of these curves in Figure 3a for penetrant ISF are distinctly different, 
with the characteristics of local caging more apparent in the lower temperature curve. In addition, 
there is a distinct difference in the subdiffusive regimes seen in the MSD plots versus 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃), 
which are much more pronounced. This is contrast to normal glass-forming liquids, for which the 
same supercooling degree exhibits a weaker or shorter caging regime than for the MSD that probes 
diffusion compared to 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) which probes structural relaxation.66–73 These disparities between 
the MSD versus time and 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃) suggest that mesh confinement may contribute meaningfully to 
the transport of penetrants in tight networks, particularly for larger penetrants, and we seek to 
refine our physical understanding of this complicated interplay of local and long-time penetrant 
and network dynamics.16

the penetrant alpha time, with the criteria 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝) = 0.1 and 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′) = 1/𝑒, respectively. 
The former criteria (𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝) is more often used in this paper, because it includes the longer time tails 
observed in these functions that reflect a subpopulation of penetrants in long-lived cages. The latter 
criteria (𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′) may more closely relate to the average hopping time that is predicted in the theory 
developed in our companion paper,41 which does not account for dynamic heterogeneity and a 
distribution of penetrant hopping times.  
 
Comparing the Role of Particle Size, Temperature, and Crosslinking on the Hopping and Diffusive 
Processes in Dense Networks  
To quantify the relationship between local penetrant relaxation and diffusive motion, we 
extract the alpha time of the penetrant 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 from the ISF and the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 from the 
MSD. As described in the methods section, the diffusion constant is obtained from the long-time 
MSD curve via the expression 𝐷𝑝= lim

2(𝑡̃)〉. The alpha time of the penetrant 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 is set from 
the decay of 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝑡̃), and quantifies the time it takes to reach one of two possible criteria: 
𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝) = 0.1 and 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′) = 1/𝑒. While the specific criterion is arbitrary, these two 
criteria will be used to illustrate aspects of dynamic heterogeneity.66,73–75 The quantity 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 will 
account for the effect of the long-time part of the relaxation curve in Figure 3. As shown in the 
literature,66 the long-time decay of the relaxation function is typically associated with the 
relaxation of the slowest fraction of particles and hence carries information on strong dynamic 
heterogeneity effects. These long-time decays negligibly contribute to the value 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ defined at 
𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′) = 1/𝑒, which instead only weakly accounts for dynamic heterogeneity by considering 
the most generic particles. We consider 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ obtained here to be closer to the average hopping 
time predicted in the accompanying theoretical work,41 since the theoretical alpha times are 
computed via a mean-field (most probable time computed) approach and dynamic heterogeneity17
(in the sense of a distribution of hopping times of dynamic and/or structural origin) is not 
introduced, although it can be included.76,77 Differences between how 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 and 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ depend on 
𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 do depend on both 𝑇 and 𝑑/𝜎, and as we will show can be very small or substantial. We 
will primarily report 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, considering 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ only where the comparison is instructive. We can thus 
extract the key quantities in Equation 1 directly from molecular simulations, the long-time 
diffusion 𝐷̃𝑝 and a characteristic hopping or penetrant alpha relaxation time 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, and examine how 
they are related and affected by the state of the network and penetrant.  
We start by considering 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, which we indicated in Figure 3 and is typically between 
𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝= 101 −103  for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0  and 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝= 101 −104  for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0 . Our goal is not to 
determine any precise dependence on 𝑑𝜎
⁄ , but rather to explore the differences between relatively 
‘small’ and ‘large’ molecular penetrants in the context of experimental systems. We plot the 
inverse penetrant mean alpha times 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 or 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ as a function of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for several 
different temperatures 𝑇 and crosslink fractions 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 in Figure 4. We emphasize that the abscissa 
combines two parameters we consider in our model; the temperature 𝑇 is plotted in different colors 
in all panels of Figure 4a and b for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0 and 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0, respectively, and is directly set in 
our simulations. However, we note that 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 has multiple values for a given 𝑇 due to the 
dependence of 𝑇𝑔 on 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠.39 For the Figure 4a inset, we replot the data to show the corresponding 
plot of 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇, but grouping data at fixed 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 instead of fixed 𝑇.18

𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for several temperatures 𝑇 and penetrant sizes (a) 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0. In 
(a) there is a noticeable collapse to a single curve, which we illustrate more clearly in the inset by 
grouping the data with respect to 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠. This collapse is no longer observed in (b). We also plot 
the shorter-time criteria for the penetrant alpha time 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ versus 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 in (c) for /𝜎=
1.0 to demonstrate that the coupling of penetrant hopping to crosslink density is noticeably weaker 
when the long-time part of the intermediate scattering function is no longer included. The 
dimensionless slopes of these plots are calculated and included in Table 1.   
 
Figures 4a and b show that at a fixed 𝑇, the inverse penetrant alpha relaxation time 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 
behaves exponentially with 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠), exhibiting Arrhenius-like behavior for both penetrant sizes. 
As the temperature increases, the absolute value of the slope of this curve decreases, demonstrating 
stronger effects of glass physics at low temperatures in relation to crosslink-induced 𝑇𝑔 changes. 
This underscores the importance of the network segmental dynamics on penetrant diffusion, and 
can be quantified by a change in the dimensionless slope of log𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇. To highlight how 
the choice of criterion 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝) = 0.1 affects our results, we plot in Figure 4c how Figure 4a 
would be changed upon choosing the alternative criterion, 𝐹s(𝒒̃, 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′) = 1/𝑒. In this case, similar 
trends are observed (i.e. an increasing dimensionless slope with decreasing temperature), however 
the magnitudes of the dimensionless slopes are significantly smaller. We speculate that this is due 
to the neglect of longer time-scale processes that are apparent in the extended tails of the relaxation 
functions seen in Figure 3, meaning that the 1/e criterion does not fully capture important aspects19
of dynamic heterogeneity effects that are accounted for with the 0.1 criterion. For both criteria and 
penetrant sizes 𝑑/𝜎, the values for the slopes of log𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 are calculated and tabulated 
in Table 1 for different values of 𝑇. We note that for both penetrant sizes, these dimensionless 
slopes exhibit similar trends to the predictions from theory in both our companion theory paper 
and prior work,40,41 showing a modest decrease in the magnitude of the slope with increasing 
temperature for both 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 and 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′. However, the magnitudes of the slopes are significantly larger 
for 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 than the slopes for 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′, with the latter values in parenthesis in Table 1. We attribute this 
to the inclusion of the longer-time component of the ISF in 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, which indicate that penetrant 
hopping is influenced by dynamic heterogeneity near 𝑇𝑔 due to the slower relaxation of a 
significant fraction of particles.66 To contrast, the longer-time decays of the ISF negligibly affect 
𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′, leading to a weaker apparent coupling between the near-𝑇𝑔 dynamics of the network and the 
penetrant hopping.

The two different penetrant sizes in Figure 4a and 4b exhibit similar trends, including 
nearly the same overall decrease of relaxation rate by a little over two decades (over all values of 
𝑇 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠). This supports the robustness of our analysis and conclusions drawn. However, there 
are subtle but important differences. At a fixed value of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇  (i.e. at a fixed supercooling20
degree), we observe that the penetrant alpha time is roughly constant with decreasing temperature 
for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0. This lower temperature also corresponds to a lower value of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠) and hence 
a lower degree of crosslinking 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠. This means that the degree of effective supercooling as 
encoded in the ratio 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇  largely dictates penetrant hopping, with the absolute 
temperature 𝑇 playing a similar role in affecting transport as the effective 𝑇𝑔. In this case, several 
effects – changing 𝑇𝑔, absolute 𝑇, and crosslinking (𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠) – tend to compensate resulting in a near 
collapse of the 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 data. This is highlighted in the inset of Figure 4a, which is the 
same data as in the main frame but grouped by 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 instead of 𝑇, and more clearly shows how 
well this data collapses to a single curve. A similar collapse of 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 is also observed 
in the companion theory paper.41 Figure 4b shows that this balance no longer holds for larger 
penetrants 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0, with lower 𝑇 values exhibiting faster dynamics (i.e. higher 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝) at a 
given degree of supercooling 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 due to the corresponding decrease in the 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠. We 
suggest that, for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0, the importance of dynamic heterogeneity is less pronounced relative 
to that of 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0 penetrants due to a greater degree of self-averaging (in time and space) of the 
distribution of matrix relaxation times by a larger penetrant. Additionally, the effect of decreasing 
crosslinking dominates more than the effect of decreasing temperature, resulting in a higher value 
of 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝. This contrasts with Figure 4c, where 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ increases with temperature at a fixed 
𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇; here, dynamic heterogeneity becomes negligible, and the effects of crosslinking 
become even less pronounced than the absolute temperature.  
This same competition is apparent in the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝, which we plot in Figure 
5a and b for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0 and 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0 , respectively, and at the same conditions plotted in Figure 
4a and b. As discussed above, the diffusion constant is defined at longer time and length scales 
than the length scale of the crosslinking mesh size (see Figures 2 and S1). This quantity is21
influenced by dynamic heterogeneity effects at lower temperatures, where glassy dynamics 
becomes important, but is also affected by the presence of crosslinkers. We thus expect its behavior 
to be similar to 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 instead of 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ , as confirmed below.  Like 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, 𝐷̃𝑝 exhibits 
Arrhenius-like behavior as defined by a straight line on a log 𝐷̃𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 plot. The primary 
difference is in the relative magnitude change in 𝐷𝑝 at different degrees of supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇. 𝐷̃𝑝 
still exhibits a near-collapse for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0, however generally decreases more slowly than 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 
in Figure 4a.  
For the larger penetrant size 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0, the situation is more complicated. In this case, 
high temperatures 𝑇 in Figure 5b show a more dramatic decrease in 𝐷̃𝑝 with 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 than that of 
1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 in Figure 4b, but a similar decrease at lower temperatures. These effects are quantified by 
calculating the dimensionless slope of the −log𝐷̃𝑝 versus 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 relationship, which we include in 
Table 1 for both penetrant sizes. Here, the 𝐷̃𝑝 slopes are significantly smaller than the 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 
slopes for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0, but are similar or larger than the 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0. The latter behavior 
for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0 is qualitatively consistent with the results in our companion theory paper,41 which 
finds that the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 changes with supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 are similar to, or more 
pronounced than, the corresponding inverse 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝. For 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0, however, the theory predicts that 
the 𝐷̃𝑝 slopes are similar to the inverse 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 slopes, in contrast to the simulation observation that 
the 𝐷̃𝑝 slopes are much smaller. We attribute this disparity between simulation and theory to the 
larger importance of dynamic heterogeneity for smaller penetrants in our simulations,66 because 
the theory only makes predictions for a mean (in a Kramers first passage time sense) penetrant 
alpha time that is closer to the value of 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′. Indeed, for 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0 the relative slopes for 𝐷̃𝑝 and22
1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ calculated using this criterion (in parentheses in Table 1) are much more consistent with 
the theoretical predictions.41  
 
Figure 5. (a) Penetrant diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 as a function of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for several 
temperatures 𝑇 and penetrant sizes (a) 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0. These are the same 
conditions as in Figure 4a and b, and similarly there is a collapse in (a) that is no longer present 
in (b). The dimensionless slopes of these plots are calculated and included in Table 1.  
 
 
To contextualize the relationship between the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝, inverse penetrant 
alpha time 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝, temperature 𝑇, and particle size ratio 𝑑/𝜎, we plot both 𝐷̃𝑝 and 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 as a 
function of 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 in Figure 6 for two temperatures each. We have used a multiplier 𝐴 to align these 
data sets at the leftmost points, to compare how the effect of changing the crosslinking fraction 
𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 (and concomitantly the 𝑇𝑔) on 𝐷̃𝑝 versus 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝. For small particles (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0), the value 
of 𝐷̃𝑝 (solid symbols) exhibits a weaker decrease with the degree of supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 than 
1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 (open symbols) for both temperatures. We believe that this is again a dynamic 
heterogeneity effect, which may be related to the well-known breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein 
relation in one-component glass forming liquids,66–73 where the diffusion constant is understood 
to be dominated by the subpopulation of particles undergoing rapid transport and is thus less 
dependent on 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 than the particle hopping time that characterizes a relaxation process.66 To23
contrast, for larger particles (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0) the change in the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 tracks the change 
in 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 with increasing 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 at low temperatures (𝑇= 300K) and even decreases more than 
1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 with increasing 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 at higher temperatures (𝑇= 339K). This indicates that there is an 
additional mechanism slowing down diffusive penetrant motion at length scales longer than what 
is probed in the intermediate scattering function (the local penetrant cage corresponding to 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝), 
which we attribute to the effect of mesh confinement. A similar comparison between 𝐷̃𝑝 and 
1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ (not shown) for both sizes demonstrates that 𝐷̃𝑝 exhibits a stronger decrease with 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 
than 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′  for all temperatures studied. This does not relate to the normal Stokes-Einstein 
breakdown, because it only weakly accounts for dynamic heterogeneity, but does further suggest 
the importance of the mesh confinement effect on the diffusion constant. 
 
Figure 6. Comparison of the penetrant diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 and inverse penetrant alpha time 
1/𝜏̃𝛼,p as a function of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 at both high (339K) and a low (300K) temperatures for (a) 
𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0. Note that 1/𝜏̃𝛼,p is vertically shifted down by a factor (a) 𝐴=
3.89 × 10−2 and (b) 𝐴= 2.53 × 10−2 such that the leftmost point of alpha time 1/𝜏̃𝛼,p at a given 
temperature coincides with the corresponding 𝐷̃𝑝 data point for better comparison. In (a), this 
comparison shows that 𝐷̃𝑝 exhibits a weaker dependence than 1/𝜏̃𝛼,p with 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for all 
temperatures, while in (b) 𝐷̃𝑝 exhibits a stronger dependence than 1/𝜏̃𝛼,p at high temperatures.24
 
To isolate the role of mesh confinement, we refer to the form of Equation 1 that writes the 
diffusion constant as the product of 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 and a mesh confinement factor 𝑋. The form predicted 
for 𝑋 is model-dependent,27,28,30 but we can directly evaluate this quantity from simulation by 
taking the product 𝑋= 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝. We plot 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 in Figure 7 for both penetrant sizes as a function 
of  𝑇𝑔/𝑇 and 𝑇, in analogy with Figures 4 and 5. Figure 7a plots this product for small penetrants 
(𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0), and as expected from Figures 4a and 5a the data roughly collapses to a single curve 
that increases monotonically with the degree of supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇. This trend is expected for one-
component glass-forming liquids due to alpha process dynamic heterogeneity,66 so in this case the 
network primarily affects penetrant transport through the dependence of 𝑇𝑔 on 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠. Notably, this 
monotonic increase in 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ is no longer seen when the 1/e criterion is considered (see inset to 
Figure 7a), demonstrating that the longer time decay in the ISF should be responsible for the 
behavior in the main panel of Figure 7a. To contrast, Figure 7b plots the product 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 for larger 
penetrants (𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 2.0), and they exhibit a significant decrease with 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 for each of the higher 
temperatures 𝑇= 339 and 320K. For a constant temperature, the increase with 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 corresponds 
to an increase in both 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 and 𝐶. We can thus attribute this dependence to the effect of mesh 
confinement (and also the reduced importance of dynamic heterogeneity since larger particles tend 
to average over it per discussions above), as this decrease of 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝= 𝑋 with 𝐶 is predicted by 
both Cai, et al.27 and Dell and Schweizer.30 However, this trend is less noticeable for the lowest 
temperature 𝑇= 300 K, where within error 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 remains roughly constant (slightly 
nonmonotonic) because at lower temperatures the dynamic heterogeneity effect becomes more 
important. The expected increase in 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 for glassy melts due to dynamic heterogeneity appears25
to cancel out any mesh confinement effects, indicating that the local caging and mesh confinement 
both contribute to penetrant dynamics in this limit.   
 
Figure 7. The product 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,p as a function of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for several temperatures 𝑇 for (a) 
𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0 with the 0.1 ISF decay criterion. For (a) there is a collapse to an 
increasing curve that reflects the breakdown of Stokes-Einstein behavior typically observed in 
fragile glass forming liquids. The inset shows the same plot, but using the 1/e criterion. For (b) at 
high temperatures, each temperature exhibits a monotonic decrease in the product 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,p that we 
attribute to the effect of entropic mesh confinement. At low temperatures (𝑇= 300K) and 𝑑/𝜎=
2.0 , the increase due to dynamic heterogeneity appears to counteract the effect of mesh 
confinement, leading to a roughly constant value of 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,p.  
 
Network and Penetrant Dynamic Decoupling 
 
To quantify penetrant dynamics we determined both the rate of local hopping via 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 
and the long-time diffusion via 𝐷̃𝑝. Our results demonstrated that (1) both processes were primarily 
governed by local network segmental motion (i.e. glass physics) at low temperatures, yet (2) 
crosslinks nevertheless had a more pronounced effect on 𝐷̃𝑝 for larger penetrants (𝑑/𝜎= 2.0 
versus 𝑑𝜎
⁄
= 1.0 in Table 1) or for situations that dynamic heterogeneity is not important. To 
understand these two observations, we quantify the coupling between the penetrant alpha time 
𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′  and the network alpha relaxation time 𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾, where the latter is obtained from the26
autocorrelation function of the Kuhn monomer vector per our prior work as briefly described in 
the methods section.39 In this case, we use the short-time criterion 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′ due to its better consistency 
with both the theoretical predictions,41 the weaker effect of dynamic heterogeneity, and to match 
the 1/𝑒 criterion used in calculating 𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 previously.39 The ratio between these two properties 
𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 is plotted as a function of 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 in Figure 8 for both penetrant sizes and all temperatures 
𝑇 studied; this comparison has previously demonstrated to be useful in the self-consistent 
cooperative hopping (SCCH) theory of hard sphere mixtures and dilute penetrants in polymer 
melts,24,65,78 and quantifies the degree of ‘dynamic coupling/decoupling’. In these previous 
theoretical papers, the ratio 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 was studied as a function of ‘packing fraction’, which is 
qualitatively analogous to inverse temperature.65 The theory predicted that the ratio 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 (1) 
initially increases slightly as the temperature is lowered from high temperature, and then (2) 
sharply decreases in a penetrant size-dependent manner (stronger decrease for smaller penetrants) 
as temperature is further lowered towards the glassy state.  This indicates a strong decoupling 
between penetrant and matrix dynamics in the supercooled regime. 
 
In Figure 8, both penetrants show only a modest dependence of 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 on 𝑇𝑔/𝑇, 
spanning only roughly a decade in the simulation-accessible weakly supercooled regime. We do 
not observe the characteristic decrease in 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 theoretically predicted for the deeply 
supercooled regime, which is expected to be computationally inaccessible, though our trends are 
consistent with the weak changes in 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 predicted by the theory in the polymer alpha 
relaxation time range probed in our simulation.41 Importantly, the relative magnitude of these ratios 
is instructive. We find 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝′/𝜏̃𝛼,𝐾 for the 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0 penetrant is at least an order of magnitude 
larger than that for the 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0 penetrant, indicating that it is more strongly coupled to the27
surrounding matrix as generically expected and as predicted by SCCH theory.24,41,65,78 This helps 
explain our results for 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 and 𝐷̃𝑝 in the previous section; in those results, there was a stronger 
dependence of 𝐷̃𝑝 for the larger penetrants on 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 even at lower temperatures where mesh 
confinement is not dominant (see Table 1). We can now attribute this to the stronger matrix-
penetrant coupling for larger penetrants, rather than enhanced mesh confinement contribution. 
 
Figure 8. Degree of decoupling between penetrant and Kuhn segment alpha relaxation times 
quantified by the ratio 𝜏̃𝛼,p'/𝜏̃𝛼,K, as a function of 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 for several temperatures and both 
𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0. While the trends with 𝑇𝑔(𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠)/𝑇 are quite weak, the larger 
penetrant 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0  couples significantly more strongly to the segmental dynamics of the 
surrounding network, as evident in the order-of-magnitude larger value of 𝜏̃𝛼,p'/𝜏̃𝛼,K  when 
compared to the smaller penetrant 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0.    
 
Degeneracy of Mesh Size Effects Due to Confinement and Glassy Dynamics  
 
From a molecular viewpoint, we only see significant mesh confinement effects on 
penetrant diffusion in the limit of large particles and high temperatures, while for small molecules 
or low temperatures we find that crosslinking dominantly impacts penetrant diffusion primarily 
through its effect on the local segmental relaxation of the polymer matrix. However, even in this 
latter limit we can demonstrate results empirically consistent with aspects of Equation 1 if we plot28
our data versus the confinement ratio 𝐶 rather than the extent of supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇. We consider 
two candidate models for 𝑋, by plotting 𝐶𝐷̃𝑝 versus 𝐶2 in Figure 9a based on the predictions of 
Cai, et al.27 and 𝐷̃𝑝 versus 𝐶 in Figure 9b based on the predictions of Dell and Schweizer.30 
Despite already demonstrating that mesh confinement does not play a significant role for small 
penetrants, these plots exhibit remarkably good agreement with the functional forms predicted by 
both models as indicated by the nearly linear trends in these semi-log plots. However, there is a 
non-negligible change in slope in both plots of Figure 9 as the temperature 𝑇 is changed, which is 
not consistent with either entropic mesh confinement model.27,29,30 As per Equation 1, these 
models that only have a temperature dependence in the prefactor 1/𝜏𝛼,𝑝  (plotted also versus 𝐶 
from simulation in Figure S2) and not in the exponent of the entropic mesh confinement factor 𝑋. 
This key observation, which is also shown theoretically in the companion paper,41 allows the 
effects of crosslinking on the penetrant relaxation time to be distinguished from the effects of 
crosslinking due to mesh confinement, in the absence of simulation determination of 1/𝜏𝛼,𝑝, 
though this distinguishing feature may become weak as in the case of larger penetrants as is shown 
in the supporting information (𝑑/𝜎= 2.0, Figure S3).29
Figure 9. The penetrant diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 plotted with respect to the confinement ratio 𝐶 as 
suggested by the forms of various literature predictions for mesh confinement effects. (a) Cai, et 
al.23 predicts that 𝐷̃𝑝∝𝐶−1 exp(−𝐶2) and (b) Dell and Schweizer26 predict that 𝐷̃𝑝∝exp(−𝑏𝐶). 
Both ways of plotting this data appear linear, even though mesh confinement does not play a major 
role in penetrant transport for the 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0 case plotted here. The main indication that the 
simulations do not agree with the idea that entropic mesh confinement is dominant lie in the 
temperature-dependent slopes, which for mesh confinement should not change with temperature.  
Conclusion 
In this paper, we used simulation to understand the role of glassy segmental scale dynamics versus 
entropic mesh confinement on the diffusion and alpha relaxation of molecular penetrants in 
permanently crosslinked polymer networks. We consider a specific form for the diffusion constant, 
𝐷𝑝∼(𝑑2 𝜏𝛼,𝑝
⁄
)𝑋, that allows us to isolate the effect of network mesh confinement 𝑋 through 
calculating and studying both the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 and the penetrant hopping or alpha 
relaxation time 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝. Both quantities exhibit Arrhenius-like trends with the degree of effective 
supercooling 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 at a fixed temperature, due to the dependence of 𝑇𝑔 on the extent of 
crosslinking. This strong coupling between penetrant hopping and crosslinking-dependent glassy 
dynamics is consistent with theoretical predictions in the companion paper,41 but also exhibits 
significant breakdown in the Stokes-Einstein relationship if strong dynamic heterogeneity 
effects66,73–75 are apparent in the hopping dynamics of the smaller molecular penetrants as the 
system is supercooled to larger values of 𝑇𝑔/𝑇.66 For small penetrants, the effect of crosslinking 
on 𝑇𝑔 is demonstrated to dominate diffusive motion, with a collapse to a single dependence of both  
𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 and  𝐷̃𝑝 on 𝑇𝑔/𝑇. This collapse is no longer apparent for larger penetrants, where we show by 
plotting the product 𝐷̃𝑝𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 as a function of 𝑇𝑔/𝑇 that we see the signatures of mesh confinement. 
While we find that crosslinking affects molecular penetrant transport through both its effect on 𝑇𝑔 
and through mesh confinement, the former appears to be the dominant mechanism for our 
simulations and we expect it will also be the dominant for deeply supercooled experiments. We30
can also show, however, that the diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 still follows trends predicted in the 
literature for mesh confinement,27,28,30 due to a degeneracy of how crosslink fraction changes with 
𝑇𝑔 and mesh size as predicted by SCCH theory.41 This underscores the difficulty of drawing 
conclusions on transport mechanisms from diffusion data alone. 
The importance of activated glassy dynamics on the diffusive motion of small molecular 
penetrants in polymer networks suggests directions for future study, and ways in which the 
selective transport of these species could be engineered into polymer materials. In particular, we 
anticipate that the role of molecular shape and penetrant-matrix interactions may complicate the 
relations we show between entropic mesh confinement and segmental relaxation. For penetrants 
that are highly non-spherical, their size will now be related to two length-scales that may be more 
or less affected by entropic mesh confinement, and will possess anisotropic interactions with the 
surrounding matrix that may affect the penetrant alpha time. While related questions have been 
theoretical studied by some of the authors,24,26 simulation will provide further molecular insight 
into the role of these various transport effects. Finally, the important role of dynamic heterogeneity 
on penetrant hopping suggests that there are possibilities for tuning the selectivity of molecular 
transport in networks with dynamic or exchangeable bonds, which would introduce another 
competing timescale that has recently been shown experimentally to affect penetrant diffusion.79

Supporting Information Figures 
 
Figure S1. Representative plots of the effective exponent 𝛽 for the mean square displacement 
versus time ⟨𝑟̃𝑝
2(𝑡̃)⟩∼𝑡̃𝛽  of a penetrant particle with sizes (a) 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0, for 
the same values of 𝑇 and 𝑓𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 as shown in Figure 2. 𝛽 is the slope of Figure 2, and both plots 
show that penetrant diffusion reaches the Fickian diffusion limit of 𝛽= 1 in the long-time region. 
The open circles denote the length scale of the polymer network mesh size, as described in Table 
S1. Intermediate regions with more noise reflect the need to perform several distinct computational 
runs with different data output frequency.   
 
 
Figure S2. The inverse penetrant alpha time 1/𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝 plotted with respect to the confinement ratio 
𝐶 for penetrant particles with sizes (a) 𝑑/𝜎= 1.0  and (b) 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0. For both particle sizes, we 
find that they are consistent with the trend 𝜏̃𝛼,𝑝∝exp(−𝑏𝐶). This primarily reflects the local 
glassy dynamics and not mesh confinement effects, and so this trend contributes to the apparent 
degeneracy between the two mechanisms for crosslink effects on penetrant transport in networks.38

Figure S3. The penetrant diffusion constant 𝐷̃𝑝 plotted with respect to the confinement ratio 𝐶 as 
suggested by the forms of various literature predictions for mesh confinement effects. (a) Cai, et 
al.23 predicts that 𝐷̃𝑝∝𝐶−1 exp(−𝐶2) and (b) Dell and Schweizer26 predict that 𝐷̃𝑝∝exp(−𝑏𝐶). 
Both ways of plotting this data appear linear, even though mesh confinement does not play the 
sole role in penetrant transport for the 𝑑/𝜎= 2.0 case shown here.
