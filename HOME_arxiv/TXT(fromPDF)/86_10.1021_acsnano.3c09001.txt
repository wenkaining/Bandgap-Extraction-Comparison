We report temperature-dependent spectroscopy on the layered (n=4) two-dimensional (2D)
Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (BA)(MA)PbI. Helicity-resolved steady-state photoluminescence
(PL) reveals no optical degree of polarization.
Time-resolved PL shows a photocarrier lifetime
on the order of nanoseconds. From simultaneaously recorded time-resolved differential reflectivity
(TR∆R) and time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE), a photocarrier lifetime of a few nanoseconds
and a spin dephasing time on the order of picoseconds was found. This stark contrast in lifetimes
clearly explains the lack of spin polarization in steady-state PL. While we observe clear temperature-
dependent effects on the PL dynamics that can be related to structural dynamics, the spin dephasing
is nearly T-independent. Our results highlight that spin dephasing in 2D (BA)(MA)PbI occurs at
time scales faster than the exciton recombination time, which poses a bottleneck for applications
aimingto utilize this degree of freedom.

INTRODUCTION
The first perovskite, CaTiO3, was discovered in 1839
by Gustav Rose, fortuitously starting a debate lasting
over a hundred years about their general crystal struc-
ture [1, 2].
Since then, perovskites have been a topic
of intense research for a multitude of features, from
high temperature superconductivity [3–5], giant mag-
netoresistance [6], oxide fuel cells [7] to efficient solar
cells [8, 9].
Especially, they have been shown to host
exceptionally high quantum efficiency in terms of their
optoelectronic performance [10–12]. This combined with
the presence of spin-orbit interaction, particuarly strong
in lead-halide-based perovskites, and a resulting broken
spin degeneracy makes them highly appealing for spin-
optoelectronic devices [13–16]. However, an indisputable
challenge to their application is the (photo-)degradation
of perovskites resulting in a notably short device life-
time [17].
In recent years, layered two-dimensional (2D) per-
ovskites have emerged as a viable alternative as several
groups have reported an increase in lifetime of 2D per-
ovskites devices [18–20].
Being two-dimensional by
design, it is relatively straightforward to exploit quantum
confinement effects to tune their band gap by adjustment
of the layer number, making them perfectly suited for
multi-junction devices [21].
In that way the efficiency
limit of a single junction can be overcome [22, 23]. One
example of such a layered perovskite is butylamonium
methylamonium lead iodide, (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.
Its band gap can be tailored from 1.5 to 2.3 eV by re-
ducing the layer number from bulk to a stack of single
∗tobias.korn@uni-rostock.de
layers, thereby covering almost the whole visible spectral
range [17, 23, 24]. Being a relatively new system, fun-
damental properties of the layered perovskite materials
have not been fully explored, particularly in the direc-
tion of their spin and carrier dynamics [25], vital aspects
to be explored for practical applications. With a change
of dimensionality from 3D to 2D, there is a potential for
breaking inversion symmetry in the out-of-plane direc-
tion at the interfaces of layered perovskites, which leads
to Rashba-like spin orbit coupling that in turn impacts
spin dynamics [13, 26–28], motivating intense research.
In that perspective, through transient spectroscopy
the coupling of polaronic states and excitons [29], spin-
selective excitation [30], the reduced mass and binding
energies were studied [21, 25, 31]. Time- and helicity-
resolved photoluminescence (TRPL and HRPL) revealed
layer-number dependent orbit-orbit interaction [32] and
through various time-resolved pump-probe measurement
techniques Land´e factors were determined [33], carrier
thermalization [34] was observed and the formation of
spin domains driven by spin currents was measured [28].
However, basic parameters such as spin dephasing
times, and the dominant spin dephasing mechanisms for
excitons and resident carriers, are still under intense in-
vestigation and debate [27]. Even within the class of lead-
halide perovskites, reported exciton spin dephasing times
range from picoseconds up to nanoseconds [29, 32, 35, 36]
and are strongly influenced by material and experimental
parameters such as spacers, choice of cation, temperat-
ure, dimensionality and layer number, as Table I shows.
Thus, it is necessary to study the individual material con-
figuration, over a wide temperature range, ideally using
multiple spectroscopy techniques to determine the dy-
namics.
In this paper we use the combination of TRPL, HRPL,
time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE) and time-resolved

ing and photocarrier lifetimes in (BA)(MA)PbI with a
layer number of four (n=4) over a temperature range
from a few Kelvin to ambient conditions. Remarkably,
we find significant changes in the PL dynamics with
temperature, indicating a strong influence of exciton-
phonon interaction and hinting at a crystallographic
phase change around 140 K. By contrast, spin dephasing
occurs on significantly shorter, few-picosecond timescales
and only slightly decreases throughout the whole temper-
ature range. Consequently, steady-state HRPL shows no
discernible spin contrast.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Transmission and PL of layered (BA)(MA)PbI
In this work, we use few-layer (BA)(MA)PbI top and
bottom encapsulated in thin hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) layers, which serve to protect the perovskite from
deterioration in ambient conditions [38]. The left panel
of figure 1a shows an optical microscope image of a typ-
ical sample, where the (BA)(MA)PbI layer appears in
brown and the top and bottom hBN layers in light blue.
At first glance the perovskite exhibits the thickness of
a bulk crystal, but a spacer every few layers (for n=4
every fourth), separates the bulk, in out of plane dir-
ection, into individual 2D perovskite layers, giving the
crystal its distinctive layered character (sketched on the
right hand side of figure 1a).
The high resolution false-color maps in figure 1b-d
show a low-temperature (T=6 K) photoluminescence
(PL) measurement from the region marked by the black
square in panel 1a. The intensity(b), center position(c)
and full width at half maximum(d) are extracted from a
Gaussian fit around the exciton peak. While the intens-
ity map shows some variation, exciton center position and
full width at half maximum are extraordinarily uniform,
indicating high sample quality.
White-light transmission spectroscopy at 4 K, shown
in figure 1e, reveals a prominent transmission dip at ∼
1.9 eV, associated with the ground state exciton of the
n=4 (BA)(MA)PbI [18, 21, 39, 40]. The single particle
band gap of 2.08 eV, extracted by Blancon et al. from

the large exciton binding energy of ∼200 meV.
Due to spin-dependent selection rules for optical ex-
citation and recombination [37], it is possible to couple
pseudospin values with involved emitting states [32, 41].
The most simple experimental evidence for this are
helicity-resolved PL experiments where a circularly po-
larized laser is used for excitation and luminescence of a
chosen helicity is recorded using a retardation plate and
analyzer. The degree of polarization P can be defined as:

configurations with respect to excitation. Spectra recor-
ded at a nominal sample temperature of 6 K and excit-
ation energy of 2.33 eV, with co- and cross-circular con-
figurations are shown in figure 1f. For these traces, we
have combined four measurement configurations, i.e. the
co-circular helicities of excitation and detection (σ+/σ+
and σ−/σ−) and the cross-circular helicities (σ+/σ−and
σ−/σ+) to suppress any setup-related artifacts.
Evid-
ently, the PL emission does not portray any measurable
degree of polarization. In order to explain this loss of
polarization we turn to time-resolved spectroscopy.
Figure 2a shows a series of TRPL traces at various
temperatures from 6 to 260 K, obtained by exciting the
sample with a laser energy of 3.06 eV and a 50 ps pulse
train (repetition rate 10 MHz, average power 10 nW). The
PL from the sample is filtered through a long pass with
450 nm onset wavelength to suppress the excitation laser
and detected with an avalanche photodiode. The indi-
vidual traces are fitted with a bi-exponential function,
from which we extract the fit parameters for amplitude
(A1,2) and decay time (τ1,2), respectively (see Fig.2b).
At low temperatures, the dynamics is dominated by the
fast component of the decay (τ1 ∼0.35 ns), while the
slow component (τ2 ∼8 ns) only contributes a small
amplitude to the total signal.
As the temperature in-
creases, the relative contribution of the slow compon-
ent increases, while its lifetime decreases monotonously
up to 120 K. This behavior is consistent with previous
studies of exciton dynamics in layered perovskites [42],
where the fast component is associated with the radi-
ative lifetime of excitons within the light cone. As the
temperature increases, the growing phonon population
leads to an increased scattering rate of excitons out of
the light cone. These momentum-dark excitons created
by exciton-phonon scattering can either be scattered back
into the light cone or recombine via non-radiative decay
channels, and the combination of these processes con-
tributes to the slow component and the decrease of its
lifetime. In the temperature range from 6 K to 120 K,
the time-integrated PL intensity also decreases mono-
tonously (see Fig.2c) due to the increased probability
of excitons accessing non-radiative decay channels via
exciton-phonon scattering, consistent with previous stud-
ies [33, 43].
Remarkably, we observe a clear change
of the TRPL dynamics as the temperature increases to
140 K, as both fast and slow component lifetimes increase
significantly, accompanied by a small increase of time-
integrated PL intensity.
The drastic jump in lifetimes
coincides with the temperature range were a crystallo-
graphic phase change, from orthorombic to tetragonal,
is observed for 3D (MA)PbI [44–47]. Although steady-
state PL in our samples shows no drastic energy shift
in that temperature regime, our TRPL data suggests an
impact of such a phase change on exciton-phonon inter-
action and non-radiative decay channels. As the temper-
ature is increased further, the fast and slow component
amplitudes and time constants start to approach similar
values, and above 220 K, the PL decay becomes mono-
exponential with a lifetime of about 2 ns. Together with
the further decrease of time-integrated PL intensity, this
indicates that exciton-phonon scattering is so prominent
that hardly any recombination can occur before excitons
are scattered out of the light cone, and that the rate
for non-radiative decay becomes larger than the rate for
backscattering into the light cone.
Given our insight into the photoluminescence dynam-
ics from TRPL and the absence of polarization in steady-
state PL experiments, we can infer that spin dephasing
in our samples has to occur on timescales that are a small
fraction of the recombination times. To resolve these fast
dynamics, we turn to pump-probe experiments.
B.
Spin dephasing and photocarrier lifetimes
To gain insight into the photocarrier dynamics and
their spin dephasing mechanism at short timescales, we
use a two-color pump-probe spectroscopy setup with tem-
poral resolution of ∼700 fs [48].
We use a circularly
polarized pump pulse (either σ−or σ+), to induce a
spin polarization of certain helicity into the system [49].
The out-of-equilibrium carrier population and spin po-
larization can be simultaneously detected by recording
the total differential reflectivity (≡TR∆R) and ellipti-
city through polarization-resolved differential reflectivity
(≡TRKE) signals, as depicted in figure 3a.
Depend-
ing on the induced spin polarization, the TRKE signal
flips its sign, as shown in figure 3b. Therefore, pure spin4

dynamics can be separated out from spurious, non-spin-
dependent signals by subtracting TRKE traces for op-
posite excitation helicity i.e. TRKE(σ−) - TRKE(σ+).
In the following discussion we refer the subtracted TRKE
signal as TRKE signal, if not explicitly stated otherwise.
To find suitable parameters for further measurements,
different probe and pump laser configurations were
tested. At a sample temperature of 6 K and fixed pump
energy of 2.17 eV, the probe energy was varied from 1.8 to
2.1 eV, as shown in figure 3c. This pump energy is above
the calculated band gap energy of 2.08 eV. The signal
amplitude maximum is close to the X0 resonance, which
is expected for a Kerr ellipticity resonance curve [48, 50].
The slight red shift can be explained through the pump
laser induced carrier densities and a resulting band-gap
renormalization [51]. For all following TRKE measure-
ments a probe laser energy of 1.89 eV is used. Having
found the optimal probe energy, we also test the influ-
ence of the pump energy.
Figure 3d shows exemplary
Kerr traces for pump energies of 2.08 eV (at the calcu-
lated band gap) and 2.17 eV (90 meV above the calcu-
lated band gap). While we observe a difference in max-
imum signal amplitude, which can be attributed to the
variation in absorption coefficient at the given energies,

there is no discernible change in the spin dynamics due
to the excess energy. This indicates that energy relax-
ation does not induce additional spin dephasing in that
energy range. We note that this observation is in contrast
to a previous study by Todd et al., where a pronounced
decrease in spin dephasing time was observed as excess
energy was increased [36]. For all following TRKE meas-
urements, the pump energy was kept fixed at 2.08 eV to
obtain the optimum signal-to-noise ratio.
We note that Kerr rotation and ellipticity measure spin
polarization (uncompensated spins per unit area), in con-
trast to HRPL, which measures the degree of spin polar-
ization (the percentage of uncompensated spins). Thus,
in TRKE spectroscopy, a decrease in the Kerr amplitude
can originate either from spin dephasing or from the loss
of the spin carriers themselves via recombination. This
makes it essential to know the photocarrier lifetime when
interpreting TRKE data.
In our setup, schematically
shown in figure 3a, this was distinctively realized in a way5
that TRKE and TR∆R were measured simultaneously
(see methods), ensuring identical measurement paramet-
ers and material properties as well as reducing the re-
quired measurement time by a factor of two.
This is
specifically important for sensitive materials such as per-
ovskites which suffer from photodegradation [20, 52, 53].
Figure 4a shows simultaneously measured TRKE
(solid) and TR∆R (dotted) traces at various temperat-
ures from 5.2 to 300 K. Within the first 50 ps, the TR∆R
signal and thus the carrier density remains nearly con-
stant, practically independent of temperature. On the
other hand, the TRKE signal decays completely.
We
thus conclude that the spin dephases within a few pico-
seconds while the population of photoexcited carriers re-
mains essentially constant on this short timescale. After
the change in x-axis scale the decay of the TR∆R signal,
on the order of nanoseconds and in qualitative agreement
with our TRPL photocarrier lifetime results, becomes ap-
parent. This strong and graphic contrast between spin
dephasing and photocarrier lifetime explains why no spin
polarization was observed in the steady-state PL meas-
urements (see figure 1f). The exciton spin polarization
is already lost before a substantial fraction of recombin-
ation occurs.
Fitting the individual TRKE and the TR∆R traces
with exponential fit functions the lifetimes τK,K1,K2 and
τ∆1,2 are extracted and plotted over temperature in fig-
ures 4b,c, respectively.
We first discuss the TRKE lifetimes in more detail.
From the experimental traces, we can see that at low
temperatures, the decay has two components requiring
a bi-exponential fit, but at temperatures of 200 K and
more, the traces can be well-described by a single ex-
ponential. We note that Giovanni et al. also observed
a bi-exponential decay in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films at
low temperatures with values comparable to our results,
and attributed the components to the electron and hole
spin dephasing [49].
However, many other works only
utilized single exponential decay times [32, 35, 36, 41].
Without the ability to reliably assign the components of
the decay to a specific carrier, e.g., by observing spin
precession and extracting the g factors [44, 54], and to
approximately capture the decay dynamics throughout
the whole temperature range of our study, we utilized
a mono-exponential fit with lifetimes denoted by τK in
Fig. 4b.
Clearly, we observe only a weak temperature depend-
ence of τK throughout the whole temperature range, with
a decrease from about 6 ps at liquid-helium temperat-
ure to about 4 ps at room temperature, with the most
of the decrease occurring at temperatures above 200 K.
Given the significant changes in exciton recombination
dynamics evidenced in TRPL, and the obvious changes
to the phonon population and exciton-phonon interac-
tion with rising temperature, this is rather remarkable.
To put this observation into perspective, we review the
potential spin dephasing processes discussed in previous
studies.
Mostly, either the Elliott-Yafet (EY) [55, 56]
or the Dyakonov-Perel (DP) [57] mechanisms have been
suggested to be the dominant spin dephasing mechan-
ism in layered perovoskites [35, 36, 49]. The main differ-
ence between both mechanisms is how momentum scat-
tering influences the dephasing: in the EY mechanism,
with each momentum scattering event, there is a finite
possibility for a spin flip, so that increased scattering
rates reduce the spin dephasing time. In the DP mech-
anism, dephasing occurs due to spin precession in an ef-
fective, momentum-dependent magnetic field, which may
result from Dresselhaus or Rashba-type spin-orbit inter-
action.
Momentum scattering leads to random fluctu-
ations of the orientation and magnitude of this effect-
ive field and causes dephasing of a spin ensemble.
In
the common motional narrowing regime, the product of
precession frequency ΩK averaged over the whole en-
semble and the momentum scattering time τ ∗is smal-
ler than unity (ΩKτ ∗< 1), and the spin dephasing time
τs is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering
time:
1
τs ∝Ω2
Kτ ∗, so that increased momentum scatter-
ing rates increase the spin dephasing time.
Addition-
ally, excitonic spin dephasing in perovskites has been at-
tributed to the exchange Coulomb interaction between
electron and hole [29] based on a mechanism developed
by Maille, de Andrada e Silva and Sham (MSS) [58].
Here, the electron-hole exchange effectively acts like a
fluctuating in-plane magnetic field whose magnitude and
direction depend linearly on the exciton center-of-mass
momentum K. In the motional narrowing regime, the
MSS mechanism shows a behavior analogous to the DP
mechanism.
Naturally, these different mechanisms will yield a dif-
ferent temperature dependence: as the temperature in-
creases, the momentum scattering time decreases due to
the growing phonon population. Additionally, in the case
of the EY mechanism, the spin mixing introduced by
spin-orbit interaction increases with increasing energy,
so that the probability for a spin flip during a scatter-
ing event also increases, leading to a monotonous de-
crease of spin dephasing time with increasing temper-
ature. By contrast, in case of the DP and MSS mechan-
isms, the decreasing momentum scattering time should
increase spin dephasing time with temperature. Addi-
tionally, however, an increase in energy and center-of-
mass momentum will also increase the effective field and
corresponding precession frequency ΩK, partially com-
pensating the decreasing momentum scattering time and
potentially leading to a complex, non-monotonous tem-
perature dependence of the spin dephasing time. With
these qualitatively different temperature dependencies,
our observations point towards the EY mechanism as be-
ing dominant in our samples. Given the few-ps absolute
values of the spin dephasing time observed in our study,
it is likely that a significant fraction of the exciton spin
dephasing occurs before they reach thermal equilibrium
with the lattice, especially at low temperatures, so that
the increasing phonon population only impacts the mo-
mentum scattering rate at intermediate temperatures.6
Next, we discuss the differential reflectivity results.
Both τ∆1 and τ∆2, extracted from the TR∆R data, re-
main rather stable over the whole temperature range, in
contrast to the TRPL lifetimes. This discrepancy can be
expected, as the TRPL dynamics strongly depend on ex-
citon center-of-mass momentum, while TR∆R probes the
individual occupation of conduction and valence bands at
the probe energy and is thus rather insensitive to the
temperature-dependent exciton-phonon scattering pro-
cesses discussed above. However, both TRPL and TR∆R
lifetimes are of the same order of magnitude and far ex-
ceed the observed spin dephasing times.
It is interesting to contrast the dynamics observed in
our perovskite samples with those in other 2D systems.
Here, two well-studied, yet very different examples are
semiconductor quantum wells based on direct gap semi-
conductors like GaAs and monolayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs).
For excitons in GaAs-based quantum wells (QWs),
spin dephasing is driven by the MSS mechanism.
At
liquid-helium temperatures, exciton spin dephasing times
in GaAs-based QWs are typically a few tens of pico-
seconds [59], while exciton lifetimes are on the order of
about 200 ps, so that a finite circular polarization degree
can be observed in steady-state PL. Due to the low ex-
citon binding energies in GaAs QWs, the spin dynamics
is dominated by free charge carriers above liquid-nitrogen
temperatures [60]. In that temperature range, holes have
picosecond spin dephasing times, while electron spin de-
phasing is driven by the D’Yakonov-Perel mechanism
due to electron spin precession in Rashba and Dressel-
haus spin-orbit fields combined with momentum scatter-
ing. Electron spin dephasing times in QWs strongly de-
pend on well width, crystal growth direction and carrier
density [61], and can exceed 100 ns in modulation-doped
quantum wells.
By contrast, in monolayer TMDCs, the exciton bind-
ing energies are on the order of 500 meV [62, 63], so
that excitons are stable well beyond room temperature.
The peculiar band structure coupling spin and valley de-
grees of freedom [64] should suppress spin dephasing, and
first steady-state helicity-resolved PL measurements re-
vealed high PL circular polarization degrees [65]. How-
ever, exciton lifetimes in monolayers are on the order
of picoseconds at low temperatures [66, 67], and the
first helicity-resolved TRPL studies showed that exciton
spin dephasing rivals exciton recombination [68].
The
main mechanism driving spin dephasing is attributed
to long-range Coulomb exchange interaction [69], ana-
logous to the MSS mechanism.
With increasing tem-
perature [70], the steady-state PL circular polarization
degree decreases, as the exciton lifetime increases due
to excitons being scattered out of the light cone while
the spin dephasing rate increases due to occupation of
higher-momentum exciton states.
For resident carri-
ers in TMDC monolayers, however, spin dephasing is
strongly suppressed due to spin-valley coupling, so that
spin dephasing times of more than 100 ns for electrons
and about 10 µs for holes could be observed at low tem-
peratures [71, 72].
While in these two examples of 2D systems, exciton
lifetimes and spin dephasing times are comparable, al-
beit on different timescales, so that a finite PL polariz-
ation degree is observable in steady-state measurements
and spin polarization can potentially be transferred from
excitons to resident carriers, the combination of long ex-
citon lifetimes and short exciton spin dephasing times in
our samples negates either possibility. However we note
that this is not generally the case for perovskites, as spin
dynamics of resident carriers could be observed in both,
2D [33] and 3D [44] perovskite systems.

Conclusion
In
summary,
we
have
studied
spin
dephasing
and photocarrier dynamics in the layered perovskite
(BA)(MA)PbI using several optical micro-spectroscopy
techniques that allow us to address an individual sample
encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride layers. We
observe significant changes of the photoluminescence dy-
namics throughout the studied temperature range from
6 to 300 K, which also include hints at a crystallo-
graphic phase transition at intermediate temperatures.
Both, photoluminescence lifetimes and photocarrier life-
times measured by differential reflectivity are in the
nanosecond range.
By contrast, spin dephasing times
throughout the investigated temperature range are on the
order of a few picoseconds, and the spin dynamics do not
change drastically with temperature. Consequently, in
steady-state, helicity-resolved photoluminescence meas-
urements, we observe no spin polarization due to the
large disparity of photocarrier lifetimes and spin deph-
asing times. Our study motivates further systematic in-
vestigations of spin dephasing in layered perovskites to
determine the dominant dephasing mechanism and its
dependence on material parameters.

METHODS
A.
Sample fabrication
The
RPP
(Ruddlesden-Popper
perovskite)
(BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1
with
the
perovskite
layer
thickness of n=4 was synthetized and purified following
previously reported methods [23, 73]. The RPPs studied
here are mechanically exfoliated and stacked using
the dry viscoelastic transfer method [74] in between
hBN onto a Si/SiO2 substrate.
For the transmission
measurement the hBN encapsulated RPP is stacked on
top of an single-mode optical fiber core [21].7
B.
Optical measurements
All optical measurements were performed in a flow
cryostat with a temperature variability from 4 to 300 K.
Inherent to this cooling technique, the sample was kept
under vacuum for the whole measurement time and thus
protected from environmental degradation by oxygen and
water.
For the steady-state PL measurements the sample was
excited with a 2.33 eV continuous-wave diode-pumped
solid-state laser using a power of 10 nW, focused to a
diffraction limited spot size of about 1 µm. The sample
was cooled to a temperature of 6 K. The PL light emit-
ted by the sample is collected using the same object-
ive, filtered by a 560 nm (2.21 eV) long pass and ana-
lyzed with a combination of a spectrometer and a charge-
coupled-device. To obtain the PL map of the sample (fig-
ure 1b) the cryostat, with the sample inside, was moved
in relation to the fixed laser spot through a computer-
controlled xy stage. The polarization-resolved measure-
ments were achieved by placing a linear polarizer and
an achromatic quarter-wave plate (λ/4) in the excita-
tion and the detection beam path. The laser intrinsically
emits linearly polarized light and both linear polarizers
were set parallel to this orientation throughout the meas-
urements. For the co-polarized configuration the fast axis
of both λ/4 was set to an angle of either 45° or -45°, while
for contra-polarization one was set to 45° and the other
to -45° or inverted. The angle was measured between the
fast axis of the λ/4 and the orientation of the linear po-
larizers. For the transmission data white light from a Xe
lamp was coupled into the single mode fiber, which had
the sample on the other side (compare sample fabrica-
tion). The varied white light signal was then collimated
and reflected via a multimode fiber into a spectrograph.
The whole setup was inside a helium exchange dip stick,
which was inside a He dewar. The time-resolved PL was
measured with a 3.06 eV pulsed diode laser, a 10 MHz
repetition rate and an excitation power of 10 nW. The
temporal pulse width of the used laser in that power re-
gime is around 50 ps, so the instrument response function
is mostly defined by the detection. Here, the fundamental
laser wavelength is filtered out by a 450 nm (2.72 eV) long
pass, while the PL signal is measured though a commer-
cial single photon avalanche diode using time-correlated
single photon counting electronics.
In our TRKE-TR∆R setup two separately energetic-
ally tunable pulsed lasers (Toptica: femtoFiberPro) were
used, one for the pump and the other for the probe
laser beam.
Each system emits with a pulse repeti-
tion rate of 80 MHz (pulse repetition period of 12.5 ns),
a spectral width of 6 meV, a pulse duration of about
210 fs and a tunable energy range from 480 to 700 nm
(1.77-2.58 eV). Probe and pump pulses were electron-
ically time-synchronized and amplitude-modulated with
different chopping frequencies, adding up to a sum mod-
ulation frequency of 922 Hz.
A mechanical delay line
changed the path length of both beams and so the time
offset of both pulses.
Here the pump and probe path
were shortened and elongated, respectively, yielding a
maximum measurement time interval of 4 ns. Through
an achromatic λ/4 plate, the pump beam was circularly
polarized to either left- or right-handed chirality. Both
beams are set to a laser power of 20 µW and are focused
with an 20x objective onto the sample, yielding a spot
size of 3 µm and excitation power density of 7 W/cm2.
After reflection the pump beam was filtered out by a
band pass while the polarization and signal amplitude of
the probe beam were measured. The polarization of the
probe beam was analyzed for its ellipticity by a combin-
ation of a λ/4, a Wollaston prism and two photodiodes
(ThorLabs PDB210A Si Photodetector) [48, 50].
The
difference signal of the two diodes was fed into a lock-
in amplifier, yielding the TRKE signal. The sum signal
of the diodes was obtained using an external adder and
fed into a second lock-in amplifier, yielding the TR∆R
signal. Both lock-in amplifiers were fed the same refer-
ence frequency given by the modulation sum-frequency
(922 Hz). The setup is schematically shown in figure 3a.
With this approach it was possible to measure the TRKE
and TR∆R at the same time, cutting the needed meas-
urement time in half, compared to, as commonly per-
formed, subsequent measurements. In detail, the TRKE
setup is described elsewhere [48].
