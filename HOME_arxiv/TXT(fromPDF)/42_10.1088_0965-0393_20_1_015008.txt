Abstract.
Theory is presented for the distributions of local process intensity and
local average pore dimensions in random ﬁbrous materials. For complete partitioning
of the network into contiguous square zones, the variance of local process intensity
is shown to be proportional to the mean process intensity and inversely proportional
to the zone size.
The coeﬃcient of variation of local average pore area is shown
to be approximately double that of the local average pore diameter with both
properties being inversely proportional to the square root of zone size and mean process
intensity.
The results have relevance to heterogenous near-planar ﬁbrous materials
including paper, nonwoven textiles, nanoﬁbrous composites and electrospun polymer
ﬁbre networks.

1. Introduction
The global average pore size of thin, i.e. near-planar, heterogeneous ﬁbrous materials
and its distribution have been widely studied using statistical geometry and simulation.
Typically the context of these studies has been materials with widespread application
in society and industry such as paper [1, 2], nonwoven textiles [3], and ﬁbrous ﬁlter
media [4, 5]. Interest in the structural characteristics of ﬁbrous materials has increased
in recent years as researchers seek to develop materials for future applications such
as carbon nanotube ‘buckypaper’ [6, 7], nanoﬁbrous composites [8, 9] and electrospun
ﬁbrous networks for application as scaﬀolds in tissue engineering [10, 11].
In a seminal paper, Miles [12] provides several properties of the polygons generated
by the stochastic division of a plane by a Poisson process of straight lines with inﬁnite
length. A graphical representation of such a process is given in Figure 1a. The process
intensity is characterized by the expected line length per unit area, ¯τ. The following
results of Miles are utilized in the present study:
• The expected area of polygons is
¯a = π
¯τ 2 .
(1)
• The distribution of diameters of the largest circle inscribed within
polygons is exponential with mean
¯d = 1
¯τ
(2)
• ¯a and ¯d are independent of the width of lines, for any probability density
of line widths.
Miles showed also that the expected number of sides per polygon is 4 and that the
fraction of triangles is P(3) = (2 −π2
6 ) ≈0.355; Tanner [13] obtained the fraction of
quadrilaterals, P(4) ≈0.381. The fractions of polygons with more than 4 sides are not
known analytically, but have been obtained by Monte Carlo methods [14, 15]. We note
that very similar results were obtained by Piekaar and Clarenburg [4] from simulations
of networks of ﬁbres with ﬁnite length. Crain and Miles [14] observed the probability of
n-sided polygons was well approximated by the Poisson variable (n −3) with mean
(¯n −3) = 1.
This result was used by Dodson and Sampson [16] to approximate
the probability density functions for polygon areas and perimeters, assuming regular
polygons. The coeﬃcient of variation of polygon area was close to 2 and that of polygon
perimeter was
√
3/2; despite the assumption of regularity, these are close to the analytic
results of Miles [12].
Now, each intersection between lines represents one of the vertices of four polygons
and for a Poisson process of inﬁnite lines, Miles [12] gives the expected number of
intersections per unit area as ¯τ 2/π, i.e. 1/¯a. For the case of networks lines with ﬁnite
length and constant width (Figure 1b), the expected number of intersections per unit
area was derived by Kallmes and Corte [17] for inﬁnite networks; in practical contexts,
this can be considered satisﬁed of samples are large relative to the dimensions of voids.Spatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

Recently it has been shown [18] that Kallmes and Corte’s expression for ﬁnite lines is
the same as that of Miles for inﬁnite lines. Further, Berhan et al. [19] showed the same
dependency by considering the probability of intersection of segments of ﬁnite length
curved ﬁbres (e.g. Figure 1c); validity was conﬁrmed via simulation studies for networks
of ﬁbres with sinusoidal curvature with diﬀering sinusoidal frequency. Accordingly, we
may be conﬁdent that theory describing a planar Poisson process of inﬁnite length lines
provides an appropriate reference to probe the void structure of networks of ﬁnite and
curved ﬁbres, greatly simplifying the analysis.
Statistical geometric models for the polygon area and pore diameter distribution
suggest that these are described by gamma distributions [20–22] and this has been
conﬁrmed through simulation [5] and by measurements on paper [23, 24], nonwoven
textiles [25] and electrospun polymer nanoﬁbre networks [26]. Whereas these models
and measurements characterize the global average pore dimensions and its distribution,
preliminary inspection of Figure 1 reveals signiﬁcant local diﬀerences in pore dimensions
corresponding to the underlying variability in process intensity. Quantiﬁcation of local
variability in pore dimensions is the focus of this study.
The variance of local process intensity, and hence that of local mass density
was derived for a planar Poisson process of rectangles by Dodson [27] and has
since been widely employed as the standard reference in quantifying variability in
paper [28].
Relationships between network uniformity and fracture behaviour have
been demonstrated for this material [29, 30]. Similarly, ﬂow and ﬁltration eﬃciency in
ﬁbrous ﬁlters exhibit variability between regions [31, 32]. In a theoretical treatment,
Chatterjee [33] considered the local average elastic modulus of nanoﬁbrous composites
and demonstrated a strong sensitivity to the pore size of the constituent ﬁbre network.
Holzmeister et al. varied local pore size in electrospun polymer scaﬀolds for tissue
engineering by generating networks of ﬁbres with bimodal distributions of diameter
and remarked that the tendency of cells to proliferate on these scaﬀolds was inﬂuenced
by local void dimensions [34].
Here we consider the distribution of local process intensity for a Poisson processSpatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

of inﬁnite lines. From this we obtain approximate probability density functions for the
distribution of local averages of pore area and pore diameter in planar stochastic ﬁbrous
materials.
2. Variance of local process intensity
We seek the variance of local process intensity for a planar Poisson line process of mean
intensity, ¯τ, partitioned into contiguous square zones of side, x. We denote the local
process intensity within such zones, eτ.
Before proceeding, it is helpful to obtain estimates of the likely range of ¯τ
encountered in real materials. If the expected mass per unit area, or ‘areal density’, of a
ﬁbre network is, ¯β (kg m−2), and the linear density of the constituent ﬁbres is δ (kg m−1),
then the expected process intensity, ¯τ = ¯β/δ. For materials such as paper and nonwoven
textiles, with mass per unit area between 20 and 100 g m−2 we expect ¯τ to be of
order 102 mm−1; for electrospun networks of polymer ﬁbres with mass per unit area
around 10 g m−2 and ﬁbre diameter around 1 µm we expect ¯τ to be of order 103 mm−1.

The expected total length of lines in a square zone of side x is
¯L = ¯τ x2 .
(4)
We denote the length of secants in a square of side x, lx, with expected length, ¯lx = ¯l1 x.
It follows that the expected number of secants in a square of side x is
¯N =

Note also that σ2

containing e
N secants. Thus,
σ2
x(eτ) = σ2(eL1)

(9)
Now, eL1 is a random variable obtained as the sum of the lengths of eN independent
and identically distributed secants in a unit square, i.e. eL1 = P e
N
i=0 l1,i, where l1,i is a
continuous random variable with probability density given by Equation (3) and eN takes
integer values. The mean and variance of eL1 are given by [36]
¯L1

(10)
σ2(eL1) = ¯N σ2(l1) + l1

2.1. Distribution of local process intensity
From the Central Limit Theorem, we expect the distribution of local process intensity, eτ
to be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution if the expected number of secants
in a square zone of side x is suﬃciently large. For low intensity processes and at small x
we anticipate that the distribution of local process intensity will exhibit a positive skew
as a consequence of the underlying Poisson process for eN.
Derivation of the distribution of eτ has proved intractable, so here we estimate the
skewness of the distribution by considering a Poisson process of secants in a unit square.
The inﬂuence of changing ¯τ or x is therefore captured entirely by varying the expected
number of secants in the unit square, ¯N. From Equations (5) and (15), the mean andSpatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

To test the validity of Equation (18) and to probe the distribution of eτ further, a Monte-
Carlo simulation of random lines in a unit square was carried out using Mathematica [37].
The number of lines in a unit square was generated as a Poisson random variable with
mean ¯N.
For each random line, the code generated a pair of points drawn from a
standard uniform distribution to represent a coordinate through which the line passed.
This coordinate was associated with an angle drawn from a uniform distribution on
the interval [−π/2, π/2). The equation of the line was generated from the coordinate
and the angle; its points of intersection with the perimeter of the unit square were
calculated, allowing the length of the line to be computed. For each ¯N, 106 unit squares
containing N lines were simulated and the local process intensity computed as the total
length of the lines in each square. As a check, the distribution of 106 random lines
was compared with the probability density given by Equation (3); the mean agreed
within 0.003 % and the variance agreed within 0.11 %.Spatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

The skewness of the local process intensity, γ1(eτ), of the simulation data arising

Data labels represent the value of N input to the simulation and the broken line has

Histograms of the local process intensity arising from the simulations are plotted in

When ¯N is greater than about 50, the skewness is negligible and the Gaussian can be

2.2. Distribution of local average pore area
We proceed assuming the distribution of local process intensity to be Gaussian with
mean ¯τ and variance ¯τ/x (cf. Equation (16)), i.e.
g(eτ) =
r x
2 π ¯τ e−x (eτ−¯τ)2
2 ¯τ
.
(20)
We note that for ¯τ x > 20,
R 0
−∞g(eτ) deτ < 4 × 10−6; accordingly, truncation of the
distribution such that 0 ≤eτ < ∞is unnecessary for practical purposes.
From Equation (1), we expect the local average pore area to be
ea = π
eτ 2
.
(21)
Inevitably, when a network is partitioned into contiguous square zones, some polygons
intersect the perimeter of the zone. The expected number of polygons intersecting the
perimeter of a square zone of side x can be approximated as nperim = 4 x/ ¯d = 4 x ¯τ
and the expected number of polygons in the square is narea = x2/¯a = x2 ¯τ 2/π.
So, the expected fraction of polygons intersecting the perimeter of the square is
approximately nperim/narea = 4 π/(¯τ x).
When ¯τ = 100 mm−1 and x = 1 mm this
fraction is 0.125 and narea > 3000 so it is reasonable to assume that Equation (21)
provides a good measure of the local average polygon area.
The probability density of local average pore area is obtained by a simple variable
transform of Equation (20):

The probability density given by Equation (22) is plotted for a range of process
intensities, ¯τ and scales of inspection, x in Figure 4. As anticipated, the distribution
exhibits a positive skew and narrows with increasing ¯τ and x.
A consequence ofSpatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

neglecting skewness and using the approximation given by Equation (18) for the variance
of local average process intensity is that the expected local average pore area obtained as
¯a =

0 ˜a p(˜a) d˜a is slightly greater than π/¯τ 2 though for ¯τ ≥200 mm−1 and x ≥1 mm
the error is less than 2 %. The variance of local average pore area, is given by

(23)
It has not been possible to obtain a closed form solution to this integral though an
analytic estimate can be obtained through consideration of Equations (5) and (21).
From Equation (5) we expect the local average process intensity to be

Now, e
N is a Poisson variable and since P( eN = 0) > 0, σ2
x(1/ eN2) is undeﬁned.
Typically, we expect ¯N to be suﬃciently large that P( eN = 0) is negligible such that
0 < 1/ eN ≤1. A convenient approximation to the discrete Poisson probability function
is the probability density of a Gamma distributed continuous random variable with

We observe that the inﬂuence of zone size and process intensity is coupled such that the

Equation (23) is plotted against mean process intensity in Figure 5. The solid lines
represent the approximation given by Equation (32).
We note that Schweers and
L¨oﬄer [31] report a coeﬃcient of variation of local ﬂow velocity through a porous
nonwoven ﬁlter of 0.3 at the 0.5 mm scale, consistent with the values of CV (˜a) plotted
in Figure 5.
2.3. Distribution of local average pore diameter
Although the voids generated by random ﬁber processes are irregular convex polygons,
it is often convenient to characterize their dimensions by an equivalent diameter, rather
than by area. A good candidate for such a measure is the equivalent diameter determined
from the hydraulic radius and deﬁned as the ratio of the area of a polygon to its
perimeter. Despite the established utility of this measure, to calculate it for our system
we would require knowledge of the joint probability density of polygon perimeter and
area, which is unknown. Two alternative measures have been employed previously: the
diameter of the largest circle that can be inscribed within a polygon [5, 12] and the
diameter of a circle with the same area as a polygon [1, 20]. The expected diameterSpatial variability of ﬁbrous materials

of inscribed circles is given by Equation (2), and from Equation (1) it follows that
the expected diameter of circles with the same area as a polygons is ¯deq = 2/¯τ. So,
in both cases we see that the expected pore diameter is inversely proportional to the
process intensity ¯τ, and we expect this dependency to hold for the local averages such
that ˜d = ˜deq/2 = 1/eτ. Accordingly, we proceed to derive the probability density for the
local averages of diameters of inscribed circles and note that this can be readily scaled
to give the probability density of equivalent diameters; for convenience, we will term
the diameter of an inscribed circle the ‘pore diameter’.
The probability density of local average pore diameter is obtained by a variable

that of the local average pore diameter, so again depends only on the dimensionless
product ¯τ x. The coeﬃcient of variation of local average pore diameter as calculated
via numerical integration to obtain the moments of Equation (34) is plotted against
mean process intensity in Figure 7. The solid lines represent the approximation given
by Equation (41).
In the introduction, we noted that the coeﬃcients of variation of polygon perimeter
and diameter were
√
3/2 and approximately 2, respectively, and thus are independent of
process intensity. To a ﬁrst approximation we expect the ‘diameter’ of convex polygons
to be proportional to their perimeter, such that the coeﬃcient of variation of diameters is
constant also‡. Here we have seen that the coeﬃcients of variation of the local averages
of pore diameter and pore area are not constant, and both exhibit the same strong
dependence on the mean process intensity and the scale of inspection.

3. Conclusions
Established theory for the global average polygon dimensions arising from planar Poisson
line processes has been extended to give the distributions of local average polygon
dimensions.
Assuming that the number of lines passing through contiguous square
regions of the network has a Poisson distribution, the variance of local average process
intensity has been shown to be proportional to the mean process intensity and inversely
proportional to the side of the square regions. Through an approximation, the skewness
of the distribution has been shown to be inversely proportional to the square root of the
expected number of lines passing through each region; this result has been conﬁrmed
by Monte Carlo simulation.
For typical values of process intensity observed in heterogeneous ﬁbrous materials,
the skewness of the distribution of local process intensity rapidly approaches zero and
the distribution can be assumed to be Gaussian.
On this basis, the distribution of
local average polygon area and that of local average pore diameter have been derived,
along with approximate expressions for their coeﬃcients of variation. We ﬁnd that the
coeﬃcient of variation of pore diameter is inversely proportional to the square root of
the product of process intensity and zone size; the coeﬃcient of variation of pore area
is double that of pore diameter.
