Abstract 
 
 
The drying step of dense refractory castables containing hydraulic binders is a critical process, which 
usually requires using slow heating rates due to the high explosion trend of such materials during their first 
thermal treatment. Thus, this work investigated the performance of alternative additives to induce faster and 
safer drying of self-flowing high-alumina refractory castables bonded with calcium aluminate cement (CAC) 
or hydratable alumina (HA). The following materials were analyzed for this purpose: polymeric fibers, a 
permeability enhancing compound (RefPac MIPORE 20) and an organic additive (aluminum salt of 2-
hydroxypropanoic acid). The drying behavior and explosion resistance of the cured samples were evaluated 
when subjecting the prepared castables to heating rates of 2, 5 or 20°C/min and the obtained data were then 
correlated to the potential of the drying agents to improve the permeability and mechanical strength level of 
the refractories at different temperatures. The collected results attested that the selected additives were more 
efficient in optimizing the drying behavior of the CAC-bonded compositions, whereas the HA-containing 
castables performed better when the aluminum-based salt was blended with a small amount of CAC (0.5 wt.%), 
which changed the binders hydration reaction sequence and optimized the permeability level of the resulting 
microstructure. Consequently, some of the designed compositions evaluated in this work showed improved 
drying behavior and no explosion was observed even during the tests carried out under a high heating rate 
(20°C/min).

1. Introduction 
 
The growing demand for advanced refractory castables in recent decades has been motivated by the 
requirements of industrial processes operating at high temperatures, such as iron and steelmaking, cement and 
glasses production, petrochemical, and others, which has helped to develop new technologies and innovations 
in the design of high-performance ceramic systems.   
Although the continuous progress of refractory castables has focused on finding alternatives to reduce 
the use of hydraulic binders in formulations, calcium aluminate cement (CAC) is still the most used one in a 
large number of commercial products due to its ability to provide higher green mechanical strength, presenting 
a suitable setting time (around 6-24h) and chemical resistance to a variety of corrosive environments [1-3]. 
Hydratable alumina (HA) is another binder usually applied in castable compositions, as it helps to design 
products with high refractoriness, without the drawbacks (i.e., generation of phases with low melting point) 
associated with the presence of CaO, derived from CAC, in formulations containing alumina and silica [4-6]. 
During HA hydration, a thick layer of amorphous gel is initially generated on the alumina’s surface and it may 
be partially crystallized at higher temperatures or over a longer time, into boehmite [Al2O3.(1-2)H2O)] and 
bayerite (Al2O3.3H2O). Besides that, the gel phase is able to fill in the pores and defects of the microstructure 
[3,7], reducing the refractory’s permeability and, consequently, its explosion resistance during the drying step. 
As a consequence of the low permeability of dense castables bonded with hydraulic binders, spallings 
or even explosions could take place during the first heating treatment of these ceramics, depending on the 
selected heating schedule. Such behavior is related to the steam pressure derived from the free-water release 
and decomposition of hydrated phases at temperatures above 100°C, as the entrapment of the gas phase in the 
resulting microstructure during heating may easily lead to pressure levels that exceed the green mechanical 
strength of the ceramic. Thus, in order to avoid this undesired condition, the drying schedule of dense refractory 
castables are usually based on various dwell steps at intermediate temperatures in the 100-600°C range, which 
leads to very conservative heating procedures. 
Aiming to optimize the energy efficiency and to reduce the cost associated with this first thermal 
treatment of the refractories, various attempts have been carried out in order to adjust the permeability of such 
materials and provide easier and safer vapor release. Some alternatives proposed in the literature are using3 
 
additives that may act generating permeable channels in the consolidated microstructure, favoring the 
percolation of the pressurized fluids during the first heating step of these materials. Among the proposed 
additives, using polymeric fibers with a low melting point and decomposition temperature is the most common 
and well-known solution presented in the literature [8-10]. For instance, polyethylene [11] and polypropylene 
fibers are likely drying agents for castables due to their low melting point (100-120°C and > 150°C, 
respectively). 
Additionally, a new sort of additive for enhancing the drying ability of CAC-bonded castables has been 
reported in the literature, called RefPac Mipore 20 (MP) [12,13]. This product acts by modifying the cement 
hydration reaction sequence, giving rise to gel-like phases that decompose mainly around 100-150°C, inducing 
the formation of a more permeable microstructure that allows the steam release from the inner region up to the 
material’s surface, during the initial stages of the heating process [14]. The role of this additive in castables 
containing other hydraulic binders is still not well described, although Luz et al. [15] evaluated the 
incorporation of MP into vibratable high-alumina HA-bonded refractories. 
Aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid [Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3] is also an interesting anti-explosion 
agent, which can increase the number of permeable paths in magnesia-based refractory products [16-18]. 
However, the acting mechanism of this compound is not clearly reported and there is a lack of studies using 
this additive in compositions containing hydraulic binders. 
 
Based on these aspects, this work investigates: (i) the influence of two novel commercial drying agents 
commercially available [polyethylene fibers (Emsil-Dry) and the active compound called RefPac MiPore 20] 
in the drying performance of self-flowing high-alumina refractory castables (containing calcium aluminate 
cement or hydratable alumina as binders); and (ii) the feasibility of incorporating aluminum salt 2-
hydroxypropanoic acid [Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3] into hydratable alumina-bonded castables, as an alternative 
route to obtain more permeable microstructures, which could be less prone to undergo explosion under faster 
heating schedules. 
 
2. Experimental procedure 
 
2.1 Raw materials selection and designed compositions 
High-alumina refractory castables were designed based on the Andreasen’s particle4 
 
packing model [19,20], as described in Eq. 1, and considering the distribution coefficient (q) equal to 0.21, in 
order to obtain self-flowing compositions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where CPFT is the cumulative percentage of particles finer than D; q is the distribution coefficient; D is the 
particle size; and DL is the largest particle size. 
The selected raw materials for the studied formulations consisted of tabular alumina (D £ 6 mm, Almatis, 
Germany), calcined and reactive aluminas (CL370 and CT3000SG, respectively, supplied by Almatis, 
Germany), as indicated in Table 1. Calcium aluminate cement (CAC, Secar 71, Imerys Aluminates, France) 
or hydratable alumina (HA, Alphabond 300, Almatis, Germany) were the binders evaluated in this work. In 
order to improve the drying ability of the castables, 0.1 wt.% of polyethylene fibers with length < 6 mm (Emsil 
Dry, Elkem, Norway) or 2.5 wt.% of the active compound Refpac Mipore 20 (MP, Imerys Aluminate, France) 
were incorporated into the CAC-bonded compositions. The latter is a powdered additive (d50 ~10-20 μm), 
comprised by organic compounds mixed with mineral phases containing Al2O3 (39-43 wt.%), CaO (12-15 
wt.%) and MgO (16-20 wt.%) [12]. Previous investigations [13,14] reported that 2.5 wt.% of MP in replacing 
the CAC content is a suitable amount to provide improved flowability, green mechanical strength and high 
permeability for the castables. For this reason, the same content of MP was selected to be used in the designed 
compositions of this work.  
Table 2 presents the compositions prepared for the evaluation of the aluminum salt [AS, 
Al(CH3CHOHCOO)3, Quimibras Industrias Químicas S.A., Brazil] as a drying agent for high-alumina 
castables bonded with hydratable alumina (HA). According to some investigations presented in the literature 
[16-18], 0.3-0.5 wt.% of AS may be sufficient to modify the permeability of MgO-bonded castable 
compositions. Hence, it was decided to analyze the addition of 0.3 or 0.6 wt.% of this organic compound to 
the designed alumina-based systems. 
During the mixing step of the refractories, distinct water contents were incorporated into the mixes 
(Table 1 and 2), as well as 0.2 wt% of a polymeric dispersant (Castament® FS60, BASF, Germany). The only 
exception was related to the compositions containing RefPac MiPore 20, as this drying agent already contains 
dispersant compounds among its components [13].

2.2 Refractory castables’ processing and characterization 
 
The compositions with and without additives were prepared in a planetary rheometer [21] and the mixing 
procedure consisted of dry and wet homogenization stages. After that, the curing behavior and setting time of 
the fresh castables’ mixes were characterized by measuring the propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves 
(Ultrasonic Measuring Test System IP-8, Germany) in the compositions as a function of time at room6 
 
temperature (~22°C). The prepared castables were also molded as: (i) cylinders (50 x 50 mm2) for the explosion 
and drying tests; (ii) discs (d = 75 mm, h = 26 mm) for the permeability measurements; and (iii) bars (150 x 
25 x 25 mm3) for the 3-point bending tests and apparent porosity characterization. 
The samples’ curing was carried out at 30°C for 24h or 36h and the CAC-containing compositions were 
kept in closed plastic bags containing a beaker with water in order to maintain a humid environment. After 
that, the castables were demolded and dried at 110°C for 24h and some of the specimens were calcined in the 
200-400°C range, using a heating rate of 1°C/min and dwell time of 5h at the selected temperature.  
The drying behavior and explosion resistance of cured samples was carried out in a device that 
simultaneously measured the thermogravimetric profiles and the samples’ temperature [22], when applying 
heating rates of 2, 5 and 20°C/min up to 600°C. On the other hand, permeability tests were conducted at room 
temperature [23] using samples obtained after drying at 110°C/ for 24h and calcining at 200, 300 and 450°C 
for 5h. The Darcian (k1) and non-Darcian (k2) permeability constants were calculated by fitting the 
(𝑃!" −𝑃#") (2𝑃#𝐿
⁄
) values as a function of the percolating fluid velocity (vs) to a polynomial function, as 
described by the Forchheimer equation [24].

where Pe and Ps are, respectively, the inlet and outlet pressures of the air-flow; L is the samples’ thickness, µ 
(1.8 x 10-5 Pa.s) is the air viscosity and ρ (1.08 kg/m3) is its density at room temperature. 
Additionally, cold modulus of rupture (3 point-bending tests, ASTM C133-97) and apparent porosity 
(ASTM C830-00) of the compositions containing polymeric fibers or Refpac Mipore 20 (Table 1) were 
determined after curing, drying and calcining (200, 300 and 400°C for 5h) these refractories. On the other 
hand, the formulations containing aluminum salt were subjected to the same experimental tests, but their 
properties were only evaluated after curing (30°C for 24 or 36h) and drying (110°C for 24) steps. A total of 
five samples for each composition and selected firing temperature were analyzed during these measurements.

3 Results and discussion 
 
3.1 - Effect of the polymeric fibers (ED) and active compound (MP) in the castables’ properties 
 
The curing behavior and setting time of the prepared castables were analyzed by recording the ultrasonic 
wave propagation velocity results as a function of time at 22°C for 24h. As shown in Fig. 1a, the reference 
composition containing cement (5CAC) presented a great increase in the measured velocity between 5 to 13 
hours, whereas the hardening process of the one bonded with hydratable alumina (5HA, Fig. 1b) began after 3 
hours, nevertheless presenting lower velocity values in the evaluated period of time.

(CAC) or (b) hydratable alumina (HA). ED = polymeric fibers and MP = Refpac Mipore 20. The samples were 
maintained at 22°C for 24h. 
 
This performance may be related to the differences in the hydration process of the tested hydraulic 
binders. For instance, CAC hydration usually gives rise to hydrated compounds (i.e., CAH10, C2AH8, C3AH6 
and/or AH3, where C = CaO, A = Al2O3 and H = H2O) and the likelihood of which one of them will be 
precipitated in the refractory microstructure is associated with the curing time and temperature conditions, as 
well as the water content used during the mixing stage and the humidity level available in the curing 
environment [12]. In order to favor the precipitation of the most stable hydrates (crystalline C3AH6 and AH3), 
curing temperatures above 35°C are suggested, which should result in refractories with improved green 
mechanical strength [2]. As the ultrasonic measurements were carried out at room temperature (22°C), other

metastable hydrated compounds (such as CAH10, C2AH8 and gel-like AH3) may also be generated in the 
designed compositions, and the precipitation of these compounds is responsible for the setting and hardening 
behavior of the CAC-bonded castables (Fig. 1a).    
On the other hand, the hydration of hydratable alumina is based on the generation of gel-like hydrated 
phases, which can crystallize and mainly result in the formation of Al2O3.3H2O and Al2O3.(1-2)H2O. Such 
transformations usually lead to microstructures with limited permeability level and lower green mechanical 
strength than the ones derived from CAC hydration process [7]. As confirmed in Fig. 1b, indeed HA-bonded 
castables presented lower velocity results than the compositions containing CAC, which can be related to the 
development of samples’ with lower elastic modulus for the former formulations.  
The incorporation of the polymeric fibers (ED) into the designed compositions did not induce significant 
changes in the curing behavior of the castables, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the presence of the MP additive 
modified the hydration reaction sequence of the binders [12-15], which affected the setting time of the 
castables, speeding up their hardening. 
A more cohesive microstructure is associated to higher mechanical strength and lower permeability 
level, and both aspects have important roles on the drying behavior of ceramic linings. For instance, the HA-
bonded refractories presented lower flexural strength (Fig. 2b) than the ones with CAC (Fig. 2a), which 
indicates that such materials are more prone to fail or explode, as they will be able to withstand limited steam 
pressure levels during heating. Moreover, higher water content was added to the hydratable alumina-containing 
compositions (Table 1), increasing the refractories’ pressurization likelihood.  
The mechanical strength of the analyzed castables increased when drying the samples at 110°C or firing 
them at different temperatures in the range of 200-400°C (Fig. 2), most likely due to the crystallization of the 
gel-like hydrates and formation of interconnected crystalline hydrated phases in the microstructure at higher 
temperatures, favoring binding among the adjacent coarse and fine components of the composition [3, 6]. 
Although the release of free-water and the decomposition of the hydrated compound may induce the samples’ 
porosity increase, the binding effect enhanced the overall cold flexural strength values of the designed 
refractories.9 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 – Cold flexural strength of the evaluated castables obtained after curing (30°C/24h), drying 
(110°C/24h) and firing (200-400 °C/5h). 
 
Regarding the additive-containing refractories, adding fibers to 5CAC-ED and 5HA-ED did not affect 
the mechanical strength of the samples to a major extent (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the permeability enhancing 
compound (MP) led to the decrease in the castables’ modulus of rupture in all tested conditions, when 
compared to the reference materials (5CAC or 5HA). Such behavior has already been reported in previous 
studies [12-15], and it was related to the interaction of this additive with the binders, which changes the 
hydration reaction sequence and the precipitated phases in the resulting microstructure. 
Despite this side effect, MP is very effective in increasing the permeability level of the 2.5CAC-MP and 
2.5HA-MP compositions, favoring the development of high k1 and k2 (permeability constants) values even for 
the materials just dried at 110°C for 24h or calcined up to 400°C for 5h (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the reference 
refractories (5CAC or 5HA) presented very low permeability in all evaluated conditions, which prevented the 
measurements of k1 and k2 for the 5HA samples after drying at 110°C and firing at 200°C for 5h, when using 
the chosen permeameter equipment [24]. Hence, in such cases (110°C and 200°C), the permeability constant 
values for 5HA were lower than the ones obtained for the same composition when fired at 300°C for 5h (k1 = 
8.98 x 10-18 m2 and k2 = 4.70 x 10-18 m). 
In general, the incorporation of the polymeric fibers to 5CAC-ED and 5HA-ED compositions only 
provided a slight increase of the overall permeability constants, maintaining the measured values in the same 
order of magnitude as the reference materials (5CAC and 5HA, Fig. 3).

Considering that both green mechanical strength and permeability are important parameters that play a 
role in the drying behavior of dense castables, the following step consisted of evaluating the drying 
performance and explosion resistance of the cured samples (30°C/24h) during their first thermal treatment. 
According to Fig. 4a and 4b, no explosion was observed when heating the castables with a 2°C/min rate and 
the main mass loss took place from 30-120°C for 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP compositions, whereas the 
additive-free and the fiber-containing materials presented more complex profiles with mass changes observed 
mainly in the following temperature ranges: 30-250°C, 250-350°C and 350-500°C (Fig. 4b). As the evaluated 
specimens were only cured before testing, the high mass loss identified at the beginning of the TG tests (30-

120°C) should be associated to the free-water release and decomposition of gel-like phases. On the other hand, 
polymeric fibers and crystalline hydrate decomposition (i.e., C2AH8, C3AH6, AH3) was mainly detected above 
250°C [12-15]. Due to the higher water demand during the preparation of HA-bonded materials, such samples 
showed increased mass loss when compared to the CAC-based refractories (Fig. 4a). 
When increasing the applied heating rates (5 and 20°C/min) during the TG measurements, 5HA, 5HA-
ED and 5CAC castables underwent explosion around 200-300°C (Fig. 4c – 4f), as a result of the reduced 
permeability and high steam pressure generated inside the microstructures. The ED incorporation into the 
CAC-bonded composition (5CAC-ED) did not induce major changes in the cold flexural strength (Fig. 2a) and 
permeability constants (Fig. 3a and 3c) of this material when compared to 5CAC. Nevertheless, the effect of 
the fibers in this system was already enough to inhibit the samples’ explosion. The same performance was not 
achieved for the 5HA-ED composition, which can be explained by both the lower mechanical strength and 
permeability level of these samples (Fig. 2b, Fig. 3b and 3d). As the 5HA-ED explosion took place at 257°C 
and the fibers’ thermal decomposition should mainly occur above 320°C (Fig. 5) [15], the selected additive 
was not able to act in its full potential during the TG tests carried out with high heating rates, resulting in a 
microstructure with a limited number of permeable paths for the water vapor release that, as a consequence, 
favored the pressurization of the samples. Hence, the polymeric additive must not only melt at low 
temperatures, but also decompose to generate suitable permeable channels. 
 The effect of MP addition to 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP was characterized by a significant mass loss 
in the 100-150°C temperature range (Fig. 4a, 4c and 4e), which can be related to the free-water release and 
decomposition of the gel-like phase derived from the interaction of MP with the binders [12]. These 
transformations were responsible for increasing the overall permeability of the samples (Fig. 3) and providing 
better and safer conditions for drying the MP-containing castables. Despite the influence of MP in decreasing 
the flexural strength of the cured 2.5CAC-MP and 2.5HA-MP samples (Fig. 2), its role in improving the 
number of permeable paths in the microstructure at the beginning of the heating process (even at 110°C, Fig. 
4) is of major importance to inhibit the castables’ pressurization.12

3.2 – Effect of the aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid in adjusting the drying behavior of HA-
bonded castables 
 
Knowing that 5HA castable is more susceptible to explosion during heating (Fig. 4), due to its reduced 
permeability and mechanical strength (Fig. 2 and 3), another route (instead of adding ED or MP) should be 
required to optimize the microstructure of this refractory. Thus, it was decided to study an additional agent to 
improve the drying behavior of castables containing hydratable alumina.  
 Fig. 6 indicates that the incorporation of aluminum salt 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (AS) modified the 
hydration behavior of the used binder, delaying the setting time (velocity increase was shifted to longer times) 
and reducing the measured velocity values. This behavior is associated with the action of AS, as initially its 
dissolution should take place in the liquid medium (Eq. 3), changing the overall pH of the refractory system. 
For instance, after the mixing step, the following pH results were obtained for castables 5HA, 5HA-0.6AS and 
5HA-0.6AS-0.5CAC: 9.44, 8.23 and 8.76, respectively.

Figure 6 – Curing behavior of the HA-bonded refractory castables obtained via ultrasonic measurements at 
22°C for 24h.  
 
The pH decrease usually affects ρ-alumina hydration, changing the overall content of the crystalline 
(bohemite and bayerite) and amorphous hydrates (gel-like phase) formed in the resulting microstructure [26]. 
X-ray diffraction of the cured castables’ matrix (results not shown here) pointed out that no crystalline 
compounds were detected in the AS-containing samples, indicating that this additive affected the hydration 
path of the prepared castables. Besides that, it was not possible to demold the cast samples of these 
compositions due to their low mechanical strength after curing at 30°C/24h. Hence, a longer curing period 
(~36h) was required to allow a suitable handling of the 5HA-0.3AS and 5HA-0.6AS specimens. In order to 
overcome this issue, additional compositions containing AS + 0.5 wt.% of CAC (5HA-0.3AS-0.5CAC and 
5HA-0.6AS-0.5CAC) were processed and the collected results highlighted that an improved curing behavior 
(Fig. 6) and green mechanical strength (Fig. 7a) could be obtained for these castables after a curing time of 
24h. 
The CAC addition to the AS-containing compositions may firstly induce the generation of a complex 
compound due to the interaction of the Ca2+ ions with the aqueous species resulting from AS dissolution (Eq. 
4). Additionally, the dissociation of this complex phase should also favor Al(OH)3 precipitation (Eq. 5) in the 
resulting mixture, leading to the castable’s stiffening in a proper period of time [1].

Figure 7 – Cold flexural strength (a) and apparent porosity (b) for the HA-bonded castables after curing (30°C 
for 24h or 36h) and drying (110°C for 24h). 
 
Cold flexural strength and apparent porosity increase could be observed for the prepared compositions 
after the drying step at 110°C/24h (Fig. 7a). Despite the low mechanical strength of the AS-containing 
compositions for the tested conditions, their greater porosity levels might be a positive aspect to prevent 
thermal crack propagation during a first heating cycle and it could be related to the shrinkage and/or cracking 
of the gel-like phase generated in the refractories’ microstructure [12]. Moreover, when analyzing the 
permeability constants measured for the dried (110°C) and calcined samples (200-400°C) of the HA-bonded 
materials, it was observed that AS effectively enhanced k1 and k2 values of the prepared castables, when 
compared to the results obtained for the reference composition (Tables 3 and 4).

In order to evaluate the explosion resistance of the AS-containing castables, thermogravimetric tests of 
cured samples were carried out up to 600°C using the same heating rates shown in Section 3.1 (2, 5 and 
20°C/min). Considering that pseudo-bohemite, bayerite and bohemite decomposition occur in the range of 
100-180°C, ~300°C and 450-550°C, respectively [4,6], the main advantage of adding AS to HA-bonded 
refractories is the likelihood of shifting the most intense mass loss step to earlier temperatures (below 200°C), 
as indicated in Fig. 8. This performance is related to free-water release and the decomposition of the gel-like 
complex phase derived from the AS presence in the mix that induced the generation of microstructures with 
higher porosity and permeable paths (Fig. 7b and Tables 3 and 4), which can prevent the steam pressurization 
during heating.  
As reported in the literature [25], the interaction of CaO (derived from CAC addition to 5HA-0.3AS-
0.5CAC and 5HA-0.6AS-0.5CAC) with the selected aluminum salt during the mixing and curing stages might 
also give rise to CaC6H10O6.5H2O, which can decompose approximately at 130°C. This transformation and the 
withdrawal of free-water may explain the more intense DTG peak of the CAC-containing formulations at 
temperatures close to 130-150°C (Fig. 8b).17 
 
No explosion was observed when conducting the thermogravimetric analyses of the cured castables’ 
samples with a 2°C/min heating rate (Fig. 8a and 8b), which can be related to the longer time available for the 
withdrawal of the water added to the mixes during their processing steps. However, as expected, a faster drying 
rate (5°C/min or 20°C/min) induced the explosion of the reference refractory composition (Fig. 8c and 8e). 
The formulations containing AS and AS+CAC presented a better performance and higher explosion resistance 
due to the role of such drying additive in increasing the permeability of the resulting microstructure (Tables 3 
and 4). When applying a more severe heating condition (20°C/min), only the samples containing higher AS 
amount and 0.5 wt.% of CAC withstood the thermal and mechanical stresses associated to the drying step (Fig. 
8e), indicating that a proper balance between mechanical strength and permeability level of the microstructure 
could be achieved. Therefore, the selected aluminum salt enabled a large amount of water vapor to be safely 
released at the initial evaporation stage (100-150°C) of the drying process [9,12], mainly due to the generation 
of a higher number of permeable paths.  
 
4. Conclusions 
 
 
This work investigated the role of novel commercial drying agents (polyethylene fibers = ED, enhancing 
a permeability active compound called Refpac Mipore 20 = MP and aluminum salt 2-hydroxipropanoic acid = 
AS) in dense high-alumina refractory systems containing calcium aluminate cement and hydratable alumina 
as binders. According to the obtained results, ED was an effective additive to induce a suitable optimization 
of the CAC-bonded compositions’ permeability, preventing their explosion during heating. However, the same 
positive effect was not achieved when adding these fibers to formulations containing hydratable alumina.  
MP was an interesting and versatile alternative route to adjust the castables’ microstructure, as its 
addition to both evaluated systems (formulations bonded with calcium aluminate cement or hydratable 
alumina) resulted in permeable structures that allowed faster water vapor release in the 100-150°C range. Such 
behavior was associated with its effect in modifying the hydration reaction sequence of the binders, giving rise 
to a gel-like phase, instead of crystalline ones, which can undergo decomposition at lower temperatures. Hence, 
MP was able to provide safer and faster drying procedures for dense castables. The only negative aspect of 
using this active compound in the designed compositions is the observed decay of the samples’ green 
mechanical strength when compared to the additive-free one.18 
 
In the case of using aluminum salt 2-hydroxipropanoic acid in the designed HA-bonded compositions, 
the action of this additive was similar to the one induced by MP, as it induced changes in the binder hydration 
reactions. Consequently, the curing behavior and setting time of the AS-containing compositions were delayed 
and a drop of the green mechanical strength values was observed. Nevertheless, these negative aspects could 
be minimized when adding 0.5 wt.% of CAC to HA-bonded with AS additive, which resulted in samples with 
major mass loss at relatively low temperatures (< 200°C) during heating and suitable mechanical strength and 
permeability values. Castable 5AB-0.6AS-0.5CAC was the most promising compositions as it withstood even 
the most severe tested condition (heating rate = 20°C/min) without presenting explosion of the samples.19
