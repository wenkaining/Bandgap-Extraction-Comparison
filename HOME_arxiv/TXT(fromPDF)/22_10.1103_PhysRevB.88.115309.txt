Abstract 
Strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures is fundamental for the design of optoelectronic devices at the 
nanoscale. Here we explore a new strategy, where SiGe structures are laterally confined by the Si 
substrate, to obtain high tensile strain avoiding the use of external stressors, and thus improving the 
scalability. Spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations and ab initio- 2 - 
 
calculations are used to investigate the strain state of laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. 
Strain information is obtained by tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy with an unprecedented lateral 
resolution of ~ 30 nm. The nano-stripes exhibit a large tensile hydrostatic strain component, which is 
maximum at the center of the top free surface, and becomes very small at the edges. The maximum 
lattice deformation is larger than the typical values of thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers. This strain 
enhancement originates from a frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, resulting from the 
combination of the lateral confinement induced by the substrate side walls and the plastic relaxation of 
the misfit strain in the (001) plane at the SiGe/Si interface. The effect of this tensile lattice deformation 
at the stripe surface is probed by work function mapping, performed with a spatial resolution better 
than 100 nm using X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy. The nano-stripes exhibit a positive work 
function shift with respect to a bulk SiGe alloy, quantitatively confirmed by electronic structure 
calculations of tensile strained configurations. The present results have a potential impact on the design 
of optoelectronic devices at a nanometer length scale. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The introduction of SiGe heterostructures into main-stream Si technology has been identified as a 
possible solution to overcome the physical limitations of Si by opening new degrees of freedom via 
band structure engineering.1,2 Much work has also been devoted to find the best deposition/fabrication 
strategy to apply tensile strain to pure Ge structures in order to reduce the energy difference, ∆   =
    
   −    
     = 140 meV, between the direct     
    and indirect     
      band-gaps,3,4,5 thus favoring 
population inversion and eventually lasing.6 A large tensile strain is necessary for enhanced gap 
shrinkage and, for the same lattice deformation, biaxial strain is more effective than uniaxial strain,7 
possibly due to the larger hydrostatic component which significantly affects the shift of the valence and 
conduction band states. According to recent k·p calculations,7 Ge grown along the [001] direction 
acquires a direct band gap (i.e. ∆   = 0) at around 1.7 % biaxial strain (hydrostatic strain,    ~ 0.73 %) 
or around 4.6 % uniaxial strain (   ~ 0.74 %). The direct gap condition is thus obtained when the 
biaxial and the uniaxial configurations reach nearly the same hydrostatic strain,7 suggesting that this is 
the dominant component for the band gap narrowing. 
Different strained configurations have been explored in the literature. A two-dimensional (2D) 
Ge thin film on Si has a thermally induced tensile biaxial strain of ~ 0.23 % (   ~ 0.1 %) leading to a 
reduction of the difference between the direct and indirect band gaps, ∆   , by ~ 20 meV.8 A higher- 3 - 
 
tensile deformation has been reached using external stressors. A silicon nitride layer has been used by 
de Kersauson et al.9 obtaining a tensile biaxial strain of ~ 0.4 % (   ~ 0.17 %) in 1 μm wide Ge wires, 
with an optical recombination at around 1690 nm (∆    reduced by 34.7 meV). Recently, Nam et 
al.10,11 used tungsten as material for the stressor layer to induce a biaxial tensile strain of 0.76 % (   ~ 
0.33 %) and 1.13 % (   ~ 0.49 %) in 200 μm wide Ge mesas showing light emission at 1710 nm (∆    
reduced by ~ 66 meV) and 1750 (∆    reduced by ~ 98 meV), respectively. The works reported at the 
Refs. 8, 9, 10, and 11 show a clear trend: an enhanced gap shrinkage towards the direct band gap 
condition can be obtained by increasing the hydrostatic strain component. However, high tensile strain 
with external stressors has been reached only using thick stressor layers (0.5-1 μm) and for basically 
large structures (> 1 μm). This reduces considerably the scalability and compromises the application of 
these methods to the design of optoelectronic devices at a nanometer length scale. 
In this paper, we use a strategy to obtain nanoscale structures with a high hydrostatic strain 
component, avoiding the use of external stressors and thus, in principle, ready to follow the continued 
downscaling of SiGe heterostructures to increase the performances of integrated circuits. We use 
epitaxial deposition of Ge on a pre-patterned Si surface with 150 nm wide trenches to create laterally 
confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes with a microscopic strain state able to maximize the hydrostatic 
strain component. Nanoscale resolved spectroscopic experiments, finite element method simulations 
and ab initio calculations have been used to map the strain field within the nano-stripes, with an 
unprecedented lateral resolution of ~ 30 nm. A large tensile hydrostatic strain (   ~ 0.53 %) is found, as 
the result of a frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, that is attributed to the geometrical 
constraints combined with the plastic relaxation of the misfit strain in the (001) plane. The measured 
strain is larger than the typical thermal strain in Ge thin films on Si(001) structures (   ~ 0.1 %) and it 
is reached without using external stressors. The effect of the lattice deformation at the stripe surface is 
probed by work function mapping with a spatial resolution better than 100 nm. The fitting of the work 
function results with electronic structure calculations of strained configurations, provides a quantitative 
confirmation of the high tensile strain created inside the stripe. The present results have a potential 
impact on the design of optoelectronic devices at a nanometer length scale for the achievement of band 
gap narrowing and, eventually, direct gap condition for lasing in SiGe technology.- 4 - 
 
 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
 
II.A Sample fabrication  
SiGe nano-stripes have been fabricated by low energy plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition 
(LEPECVD)12 of Ge on Si substrates patterned by electron-beam lithography (EBL).13 A n+type (As-
doped) Si(001) substrate was patterned with a series of trenches (depth ~ 110 nm, width ~ 150 nm, 
period ~ 1 μm) aligned along the [110] direction by means of EBL. Then, we epitaxially deposited 15 
nm of pure Ge by LEPECVD with a growth rate of 1.5 nm/s at a substrate temperature of 650 °C. 
Under these growth conditions, the migration length of Ge adatoms is much longer than the separation 
between the nano-stripes.14 This favors the gathering of Ge from the surrounding surface area into the 
trenches, which behave as material traps and represent preferential nucleation sites since a total elastic 
energy minimum is reached at their base.15 The whole process leads to the formation of laterally 
confined nano-stripes. Any SiGe epitaxial layer formed in between the structures was completely 
etched away by a gently mechanical polishing performed after the Ge growth. The nano-stripes exhibit 
a lateral width of ~ 150 nm and a thickness of ~ 110 ± 5 nm as determined by several cross-sectional 
SEM images after focused ion beam (FIB) processing (see Fig. 1). It is worth noting that the high 
growth rate (1.5 nm/s), the moderate substrate temperature (650 °C), and the very short deposition time 
(10 s) have been used in order to strongly reduce the Si incorporation from the substrate, leading to the 
formation of Ge-rich nanostructures.16 
 
II.B Tip Enhanced Raman Scattering (TERS) 
The TERS setup consists of a Horiba Jobin Yvon Labram HR800 Raman Spectrometer optically 
coupled in an oblique backscattering geometry (65° with respect to the sample normal) to a Park 
Systems XE-100 Scanning Tunnelling Microscope through a long-working-distance objective (50×, 
numerical aperture of 0.45). The opto-mechanical coupling is motorized along the x, y and z axes and 
allows for an accurate automated alignment of the exciting light spot with respect to the tip apex in 
near-field scattering (TERS) experiments. The excitation wavelength of 633 nm is provided by the 
built-in HeNe laser of the spectrometer. The polarization state of the incident radiation was set at p-
polarization (electric field parallel to the scattering plane) by using a half-wave plate inserted in- 5 - 
 
motorized rotating mount. STM tips were prepared by electrochemical etching from 0.25 mm diameter 
Au wire (Goodfellow) in a concentrated HCl/ethanol 1:1 mixture.17,18 Tips with final apex radius lower 
than 30 nm can be reproducibly fabricated using this technique.19 Tunneling experiments took place in 
air using a 1V tip-positive sample bias voltage and a 0.1 nA tunneling current. Before every 
measurement sequence, native silicon and germanium oxides on the sample surface have been removed 
by means of a diluted HF solution (10 % for 30 s at RT). 
 
II.C X-Ray PhotoElectron Emission Microscopy (X-PEEM) 
The XPEEM experiments were carried out at the TEMPO beamline of SOLEIL Synchrotron using a 
fully energy-filtered PEEM instrument (NanoESCA, Omicron Nanotechnology).20 This is composed of 
an electrostatic PEEM column together with an energy filter consisting of two hemispherical electron 
energy analyzers coupled by a transfer lens. Soft X-rays with 90 eV and 160 eV photon energy have 
been used for core-level and work function mapping. The sample was mounted such that the normal to 
the (001) surface was in the horizontal scattering plane containing the incoming wavevector. The light 
was incident at an angle of 23° with respect to the (001) plane, and horizontal linear polarization of the 
incident light was chosen in order to have a preferential sensitivity along the [001] out-of-plane 
direction. The NanoESCA spectro-microscope was operated with a contrast aperture of 70 μm, an 
extractor voltage of 15 kV, a pass energy of 100 eV, and an entrance analyzer aperture of 1 mm, giving 
a spectrometer resolution of 0.4 eV. A field of view (FoV) of 15 µm was used. All images were 
corrected for the inherent non-isochromaticity.21 Dark and flat field corrections for camera noise and 
detector inhomogeneities were also applied. A four stage preparation protocol for the cleaning of the 
sample surface was used: (i) chemical etching of the native silicon and germanium oxide by diluted HF 
(10 % for 30 s at RT); (ii) UV-ozone treatment by irradiation with D2 lamp under O2 flux (15 ÷ 20 min) 
for carbon removal;22,23 (iii) removal of silicon oxide layer (covering the surface after the UV 
treatment) by in-situ mild Ar+ sputtering (beam voltage ~ 500 V ÷ 1000 V, beam current ~ 1 µA), and 
(iv) thermal relaxation of residual sputtering damage by in situ annealing below the diffusion threshold 
temperature (~ 400 °C). Fig. 2(a) reports the monitoring of the surface contaminations during the 
different steps of the cleaning procedure on a Si test sample using Auger electron spectroscopy, while 
in Fig. 2(b) is shown the photoemission spectrum of the Ge 3d core level measured on the nano-stripes 
after the cleaning procedure. This indicates the absence of germanium-oxide contamination since no- 6 - 
 
chemical shifted structures appears at the low kinetic energy (defined by E-EF, the electron energy 
measured with respect to the sample Fermi level, EF) side of the spectrum. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
III.A Nanoscale strain mapping 
Strain information is obtained by Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS), allowing for Raman 
spectroscopic imaging with high spatial resolution at the surface of the sample.24,25 The approach 
presents unique advantages compared to other techniques, namely nanostructural investigation by 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM)26,27 and nanobeam X-ray diffraction (NXRD)13. Indeed, 
although diffraction by TEM has been shown to provide in specific cases detailed strain information 
down to the nanometer scale,26 it is also a destructive technique that would require invasive thinning of 
the samples down to a length scale comparable to the size of the structure of interest. This procedure 
would induce a significant elastic and possibly plastic relaxation that would make the reconstruction of 
the initial strain state difficult and uncertain.27 Conversely, although NXRD shares with TERS the non-
destructive character, it is limited to a lateral resolution of few hundred nm and is a bulk sensitive 
technique, unable to provide the surface information that is relevant for the optoelectronic application 
mentioned above. 
TERS exploits the local amplification of the electromagnetic field at the apex of a sharp gold tip, 
stabilized by feedback control of the tunneling current between the tip and the sample.28 This converts 
the incoming far-field radiation from a focalized laser beam into an enhanced near-field, spatially 
confined in a region whose extent is roughly of the order of the tip apex radius (20-30 nm, with an 
improvement of the incident intensity of more than an order of magnitude with respect to far field 
Raman investigations).26 The incident radiation is p-polarized (electric field parallel to the scattering 
plane) with the [110] crystallographic axis laying within the scattering plane, as schematically shown in 
Fig. 3(a), which maximizes both the TERS enhancement29 and the contrast between near-field and far-
field30. A region containing a single nano-stripe is selected by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) 
imaging of the surface (see Fig. 3(b)), and the TERS measurement is performed by scanning the tip 
over the chosen stripe. 
Fig. 3(c) shows the baseline-corrected TERS spectra measured with the tip in tunneling position 
on the nano-stripe, and on the Si substrate. The most intense peaks related to the far-field contribution- 7 - 
 
from the Si bulk (the Si-Si 1st order mode at 520.7 cm-1 and the Si-Si 2TA overtone at 300 cm-1) are 
almost unchanged for the two tip positions. Over the nano-stripe additional features appear in the 
spectrum: a doublet structure at 553-575 cm-1, and a well-resolved peak at 380 cm-1. These findings can 
be understood considering that the far-field radiation probes the same large scattering volume in the 
bulk Si even when the tip is on the small Ge stripe, whereas the locally enhanced near-field component 
probes only the nano-stripe (see the small light green hemispheres in the schematics in the inset of Fig. 
3(c)). The doublet structure at 553-575 cm-1 is attributed to the 2TO overtones at W and L, 
respectively, of the Ge-Ge Raman mode,31,32 while the 380 cm-1 peak is assigned to the 1st order 
component of the Si-Ge Raman mode31,33 of the nano-stripe due to long-range order lattice vibrations. 
Concerning this attribution for the 380 cm-1 peak, notice that the 2LA Ge-Ge overtone32 at 382 cm-1 is 
negligible. In fact both theory34 and experiments32,35 report that the Ge-Ge 2TO peaks are six times 
more intense than the Ge-Ge 2LA component. In our spectra the intensity of the peak at ~ 380 cm-1 is 
always greater by one order of magnitude than the 2TO Ge-Ge overtone. Moreover, as measured by 
photoelectron emission microscopy (see below), the stripes are rich in Ge and for high Ge content 
alloys the Si-Ge peak has been theoretically predicted and experimentally found in the range 380-390 
cm-1.16,36 
Figs. 3(d) and 3(e) show representative intensity profiles of the Ge-Ge 2TO and of the 1st order 
Si-Ge peaks as a function of the position across a single nano-stripe with lateral resolution ~ 30 nm. 
The enhancement due to the near-field contribution, and the main trend of the profiles, are reproducible 
within the experimental uncertainty and are consistent with the stripe width of 150 nm. The Si-Ge 
Raman peak monitored across the stripe moves from higher to lower frequencies as the tip is moved 
from the side toward the center of the stripe (see Fig. 3(f)).  
In heteroepitaxial SiGe structures the frequency of the Raman peaks is strongly dependent on 
strain and Ge content.31,33 The composition of the nano-stripes is obtained by X-ray photoelectron 
emission microscopy (XPEEM). The Ge concentration is measured by acquiring energy filtered 
photoelectrons image series of the Ge 3d (binding energy, EB ~ 29 eV) and Si 2p (EB ~ 99 eV) core 
levels, at the same kinetic energy of the emitted electrons (~ 61 eV for excitation with 90 eV and 160 
eV photon energy, respectively). These XPEEM measurements are recorded as three-dimensional (3D) 
data sets of the photoemission intensity  (  ,  ,  ) as a function of the kinetic energy, EK, and of the 
position, x and y, within the field of view. The main panels in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) represent the 
background subtracted core level images, showing the photoemitted intensity at the peak energy of the- 8 - 
 
Ge 3d and the Si 2p core levels, respectively. The insets show the spectra extracted from the 3D data 
set by averaging the photoemission signal at a given energy over a single nano-stripe. The spatial map 
of the Ge concentration in Fig. 4(c) is then obtained by fitting the local intensities of the Si 2p and Ge 
3d core-levels using a standard quantification model (see Appendix A for further details). The nano-
stripes are Ge-rich and exhibit an almost square concentration profile with an average Ge concentration 
   ≈91 ± 3%. This evaluation is strictly valid for the region at the center of the stripe with an 
extension of the order of the XPEEM spatial resolution (~ 100 nm), whereas variations of the 
concentration larger than the experimental uncertainty cannot be excluded towards the stripe walls 
boundary, as discussed later. 
The strain state of the nano-stripes can be now obtained by fitting the measured frequency31 of 
the Si-Ge Raman peak at 380 cm-1 with the expected strain-induced frequency shift for the employed 
TERS configuration, evaluated using the alloy composition obtained with XPEEM. The 1st order Si-Ge 
peak has been used in order to rule out possible non-linear effects present in the multi-phonon 
processes, that can conversely play a role in the 2nd order Ge-Ge spectral feature.  
In diamond-lattice crystals the first-order q = 0 optical phonon is triply degenerate with two 
transverse (TO1 and TO2) modes and one longitudinal (LO) mode. Symmetry breaking by the lattice 
distortion lifts the degeneracy resulting in frequency splitting and modification of the Raman 
polarizability tensors of the three modes37 (see Appendix C for a detailed description). In confocal 
backscattered far-field Raman spectroscopy only the longitudinal mode is excited.38 In the present near-
field TERS experiment, the Raman polarizability tensors are also modified by the presence of the tip 
leading to changes in the selection rules. Following the model by Ossikovski et al.39 we consider a “tip-
amplification tensor”, accounting for the interaction between the tip and the electromagnetic field, and 
determine the scattered intensities for the three phonon modes as a function of the angle,  , between 
the light direction and the tip axis: 
    =     ∝(  ) (2sin ϑ + cos ϑ)                       (1.a) 
   ∝  cos ϑ                                                              (1.b) 
where a and b are phenomenological tip-amplification factors (with a > b) related to the longitudinal 
and transverse tip polarizability, respectively. Considering  = 65° and a typical experimental value of 
  
⁄
≈5.5 for the employed tip,30 the ratio       
⁄
 is ≈10  , demonstrating that the TERS signal in 
the present backscattered oblique configuration is dominated by the two TO modes, which are not 
normally accessible in a standard confocal Raman experiment where the LO mode dominates. This- 9 - 
 
analysis shows that a TERS experiment can give access to new information otherwise prohibited by the 
selection rules. The same qualitative and quantitative results are obtained by calculating Raman 
selection rules in the framework of the electromagnetic theory of near-field Raman enhancement (see 
Appendix C). Since the transverse modes TO1 and TO2 are excited with the same probability and their 
splitting cannot be resolved, the strain-induced frequency shift of the first order q = 0 optical phonon 
peaks in the measured TERS spectra, ∆ , can be obtained by the average of the TO1 and TO2 mode 
frequencies (see Appendix C). This leads to the following expression: 
Δ ≈
 
   (   )[   (   ) +    (   )]                                          (2) 
which relates the Raman frequency shift ∆  and the hydrostatic strain component   =
 
 Tr{ } (where 
  is the strain tensor and Tr{… } is the trace operator) of the investigated structures. In the Eq. (2), 
  (… ) is the composition-dependent unstrained mode frequency,    (… ) and    (… ) are the 
composition-dependent phonon deformation potentials (PDP), and xGe is the Ge concentration in the 
stripe. 
Several authors40,41 reported that for xGe larger than 50%, the Si-Ge peak shifts to lower 
frequency values as the strain changes from compressive (negative) to tensile (positive). Thus the red 
shift of the Si-Ge peak, measured while moving from the edge to the center of the nano-stripe (see Fig. 
3(f)), is consistent with an increasing tensile distortion. The hydrostatic strain,   , within the stripe can 
thus be obtained from the Eq. 2 using the Si-Ge peak frequency trend determined by the TERS 
analysis. The parameters   
     ,    
      and    
      for the Si-Ge peak at 380 cm-1 are determined 
from the Ge concentration of the stripe, as measured by XPEEM, using their composition dependence 
reported in Ref. 41, where bulk-like values for the PDPs are calculated. As it will be discussed below, 
the use of bulk-PDPs leads to strain values which will be satisfactorily reproduced by the simulations 
of the strain field inside the stripe. Within the range of values that has been reported in literature for the 
set of the   ,     and     parameters, the relations provided by Ref. 41 result in the lowest and most 
conservative strain values. The two strain profiles in Fig. 5(a) represent the results from two line scan 
at different positions along the stripe axis. The profiles have similar shape and intensity. The local 
differences around 30 nm are attributed to morphological changes in the section of the stripe at the scan 
positions. 
 
III.B Size-dependent frustrated lattice deformation- 10 - 
 
The origin of the measured    profile across a single nano-stripe is now discussed. The application to 
the TERS data of the strain-induced frequency shift described by the Eq. (2) and based on the 
Ossikovski’s model, gives (see Fig. 5(a)) a tensile hydrostatic strain,   , that is maximum (~ 5.3×10-3) 
at the center of the stripe and almost vanishes at the edges. Far from the edges moving toward the stripe 
center, strain values are noticeably higher than the typical hydrostatic thermal strain in a 2D film (   ~ 
0.1%). A better understanding of the origin of such tensile deformation can be obtained by applying 
elasticity theory using finite element methods (FEM). An idealized geometry (see Fig. 5(b)) is 
considered for the simulations, where the stripe section is a perfect rectangle of width 150 nm (along 
the x direction) and height 110 nm (z-axis), corresponding to the experimental geometry. The exact 
shape of the stripe does not affect significantly the hydrostatic strain    at its surface, provided that the 
same aspect ratio and section is preserved (as measured in Fig. 1(b)). The robustness of this approach 
has been carefully verified by comparing the    values calculated by FEM over a representative set of 
different stripe sections, characterized by rounded, smooth or rough boundaries (see Appendix E). The 
size of the stripe in the third direction (y-axis) is considered infinite, allowing us to perform simpler 2D 
calculations.  
As the average Ge content is measured to be extremely high (xGe ~ 91%), the height of the stripe 
is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the critical thickness for misfit-dislocation insertion in a 
film with the corresponding Ge content.42 The simplest meaningful approach has been adopted to 
model the effect of the plastic relaxation. In the y direction, the strain is expected to relax in a film-like 
mode due to the infinite extension of the stripe. Thus in the simulations the initial     value was set 
equal to the thermal strain obtained in a film    = +0.0023    ,8 i.e. a full plastic relaxation of the 
epitaxial misfit has been assumed. The actual thermal-strain value influences the results only slightly, 
the main effect comes from the     strain relaxation arising from the geometrical constrictions along x, 
as described in the following. 
In order to tackle the strain relaxation along the x direction,  expected to significantly deviate 
from the film-like behavior,43 an ordered array of straight edge dislocations has been explicitly 
considered to extend in the y direction (thus, relaxing the strain along the x direction), and placed at the 
bottom interface between the stripe and the Si substrate (see the dislocation-induced strain field in the 
inset of Fig. 5(b)). The technique used to treat dislocations within FEM is described in Ref. 44. After 
verifying that the system energy is minimized by a number Nd of such dislocations (the energy curve as 
a function of Nd, not shown, presents a flat minimum, with values within the error for Nd equal to 14- 11 - 
 
and 15 in the present case), we computed the    strain component, displayed in Fig. 5(b). As the misfit 
in the x direction is partially removed plastically (the top free surface allowing for some extra elastic 
relaxation), the main stress to which the stripe reacts is along the z direction, due to the vertical walls 
boundary with the Si substrate, that tends to reduce the stripe lattice to the bulk Si one. The boundary 
region closer to the free surface is deformed more easily. As a result, the    strain map is strongly non-
homogenous, top portions becoming tensile-strained in order to allow for a better relaxation of the 
whole system. 
In order to compare FEM simulations and experiment, the expected TERS results have been 
simulated for the ideal stripe with a strain state as obtained from the theoretical calculations. The TERS 
simulation has taken into account the TERS probing volume by performing a weighted average of the 
   values over it. The probing volume has been quantified from the lateral resolution, experimentally 
determined (see Fig. 3(d-e)), and from the near-field penetration inside the stripe, as simulated by Full-
field 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations.45. The FDTD simulations have been made 
using the following parameters: the dielectric constants for SiGe and Au are derived from the 
literature;46,47 and a Gaussian beam was used to illuminate the tip, having the same wavelength and 
focusing parameters as in the experimental setup. The results of the FDTD simulation are presented in 
Fig. 6(a), that shows the intensity of total electric field in the xz plane after interaction with a gold tip 
having a radius of 20 nm and separated of 0.7 nm from the z = 0 plane (the (001) plane), while the Fig. 
6(b) shows the Raman signal (proportional to the fourth power of the electric field) in the Si0.1Ge0.9 
alloy together with the transversal and longitudinal profiles. The attenuation of the TERS signal shows 
a penetration depth of about 3.1 nm. 
The strain values obtained by the FEM simulations have been then weighted along the z-axis with 
the attenuation curve of the near-field inside the stripe, as calculated by FDTD simulations, and 
convoluted along x with a Gaussian function of 30 nm full-width at half-maximum, leading to the 
continuous curve displayed in Fig. 5(a). The comparison with experiments is fairly satisfactory, in the 
sense that high values of    are found (some 3 times higher than the maximum expectation for a flat 
film). However, there is a tendency of FEM simulations to underestimate the strain at the center of the 
stripe. The difference is most probably due to the simple approach used for treating plastic relaxation, 
while the oversimplified rectangular stripe shape assumed in the calculations to approximate the real, 
smoother profile mainly affects the strain at the stripe edges rather than at the center. The present 
simulation has thus to be considered only a first step in the comprehension of the complex network of- 12 - 
 
defects that is determining the final strain state, the full process of plastic relaxation in such a structure 
still needs to be clarified, possibly involving also dislocations running along the stripe walls. 
Nevertheless, the present FEM results show that    values (locally) larger than the film case are 
possible in nanoscale structure without using external stressors, and that the tensile strain has a 
different origin than the 2D geometry of a film and larger microscale structures (thickness dependent 
plastic, elastic and thermal relaxation processes), where it is strictly related to the local lateral 
constraints. 
 
III.C Strain-induced work function changes 
The tensile strain field inside the shallow volume of the stripe is responsible for a strong modification 
of the surface electronic band structure, in particular for the shift and splitting of the conduction and 
valence bands. Recent experiments48,49 and ab initio calculations50 pointed out that the modifications of 
the valence band induced by the strain are correlated with changes in the work function. These changes 
result from the modification of the surface electrostatic dipole,50,51 and from the shift of the Fermi level 
due to the band structure warping as the lattice is deformed.52 No evidences of quantum confinement 
effects on the electronic structure have been reported at the length scales investigated.53,54 Here we test 
these concepts by spatially mapping the work function of the nano-stripes and provide a further 
quantitative confirmation of the lattice deformation created at their surface. 
 The work function is measured by acquiring XPEEM image series at the photoemission 
threshold. The spectra as a function of the final state energy referred to the Fermi level, E–EF, are 
characterized by a sharp threshold depending on the local work function of the emitting region.55 Figs. 
7(a) and 7(b) represent the laterally resolved photoemitted intensity using secondary electrons at a 
kinetic energy of 4.6 eV and 4.9 eV, respectively, where contrast inversion between the nano-stripes 
and the surrounding Si bulk reflect different work function values. The work-function map in Fig. 7(c) 
is obtained from the experimental pixel-by-pixel threshold spectra least-squares fitted to the full 
secondary electron distribution model described by Henke et al.56 (see Appendix B). After correction 
for the Schottky effect taking into account the energy change of electrons extracted by an immersion 
lens (0.11 eV for an extraction voltage of 15 kV),57 we obtain Φsubstrate = 4.66 ± 0.02 eV at the Si 
substrate surface and Φstripe = 4.85 ± 0.03 eV inside the SiGe stripe surface. The value for the substrate 
is similar to that reported for n-type doped Si(001).58 The work function value of the SiGe stripe is 
larger than that of a bulk Si0.1Ge0.9 alloy (4.768 ± 0.015 eV)59 by ~ 80 meV.- 13 - 
 
The work function increase is consistent with a tensile deformation at the surface of the stripe. In 
fact, under a tensile strain the potential deformation theory60 predicts a significant decrease in the 
energy of the conduction band minima for both Γ and L valleys, and a slight increase of the valence 
band edge. This leads to a narrowing of the direct (in Γ) and indirect (in L) band gaps, and to a 
lowering of the Fermi level yielding a larger work function. A further contribution is the strain-induced 
modification of the surface electrostatic dipole, which is predicted to decrease the work function in case 
of tensile strain (i.e. to have an opposite sign with respect to the band structure-induced variation): 
under tensile deformation a lower electronic charge density is distributed outside the surface reducing 
the dipole strength and thus lowering the work function. However, our experimental findings of an 
increase of the nano-stripes work function compared to an unstrained bulk alloy, are consistent with 
and supported by recent ab initio calculations,50 showing that the magnitude of the Fermi level shift is 
greater than that of the surface dipole strength.  
To obtain a quantitative estimation of the tensile deformation present at the surface of the nano-
stripes from the experimental work-function shift, density functional theory (DFT) calculations under 
the local-density approximation (LDA) have been performed, computing the band structure and the 
surface electrostatic potential of a strained Ge(001) slab. The tensile deformation along the main 
symmetry directions has been applied by increasing the cell sides. Details of the calculations are 
reported in the Appendix D. For a tensile strain, a downward shift of both the Fermi level and the 
conduction band is found, together with a reduction of the surface electrostatic dipole, partly cancelling 
the effect of the conduction band lowering. Figs. 8(a)-(d) shows the calculated band structure of the 
Ge(001)b(2×1) surface for the unstrained case (panel (a)), and for a tensile strain of 1 % separately 
applied along the x-axis (panel (b)), y-axis (panel (c)) and the z-axis (panel (d)). The blue region in Fig. 
8(e) represent the calculated values of the work function shift, ΔΦ, as a function of the hydrostatic 
strain,   , considering the possible combinations for the non-zero components of the strain tensor (   , 
   , and    ) consistent with the values obtained by the FEM simulations:    = 0.0023     (film-like 
thermal strain due to full plastic relaxation along y), 0 <     < 0.02 (tensile strain due to the plastic 
relaxation along x and the compressive load along z), ‒0.006 <     < 0 (compressive strain introduced 
by the vertical walls along z, attempting to enforce the Si lattice parameter). By comparing the 
estimated work-function shift of ~ 80 meV with the calculated values, the hydrostatic strain at the stripe 
surface is estimated to range from ~ 0.4 % to 0.65 %, in substantial agreement with the value obtained 
from the TERS analysis (~ 0.53 %).- 14 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
In this paper we presented the nanoscale mapping of composition and strain at the surface of SiGe 
nano-stripes laterally confined in 150 nm wide Si trenches. Such stripes exhibit a high Ge concentration 
(~ 91 %), a positive shift of the work function (~ 80 meV), and a tensile strain which is maximum at 
the center (   ~ 0.53 %) and becomes very small at the edges. This strain behaviour is understood as 
the result of a frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction due to the constrained geometry, 
combined with the plastic relaxation of the misfit strain in the (001) plane, leading to a tensile 
deformation at the top of the stripe. The positive work-function shift is attributed to the warping of the 
surface electronic structure as induced by a tensile lattice deformation, providing a further quantitative 
confirmation of the strain state of the nano-stripes.  
Our results represent the experimental demonstration that a high hydrostatic tensile strain can be 
achieved in nanoscale structures without using external stressor layers. A future experimental 
investigation of their optical properties is envisaged in order to probe their actual applicability in SiGe 
laser technology. The task is particularly demanding because state-of-the-art far-field optical 
techniques, such as absorption, ellipsometry, or photoluminescence provide volume averaged 
information over the whole nanostructure volume, with very low sensitivity to the small strain volume 
at surface.  
The approach used in this work shows promising possibilities for the achievement of a band gap 
narrowing and, eventually, a direct gap condition for lasing, provided that a reduction of the Si 
incorporation is obtained and strategies for the quenching of defects formation are explored. Moreover, 
an enhancement of the strain is reasonably achievable through the exploration of different trench 
geometries. This makes the selective growth of Ge on a Si substrate patterned with seeding structures a 
technological pathway to Silicon compatible and scalable process for the design of optoelectronic 
devices at a nanometer length scale.

APPENDIX A: Ge CONCENTRATION MAPPING 
The Ge concentration within the nano-stripes has been measured by acquiring energy filtered image 
series around the Ge 3d (binding energy, EB ~ 29 eV) and Si 2p (EB ~ 99 eV) core levels using soft x-
ray excitation at 90 eV and 160 eV, respectively. The local Ge concentration can be obtained from the 
total intensities using the usual relation:61 
  = (     )   
where the subscript i stands for Si or Ge, 
0
J  is the photon flux, σ the photoemission cross-section, λ 
the inelastic mean free path (~ 0.5 nm in high Ge content SiGe alloy for photoelectrons at 60 eV),62 xi 
the elemental concentration and T the analyzer transmission. The choice of the photon energies means 
that the kinetic energy (and thus λ and T) are the same for both Si 2p and Ge 3d core levels. The Ge 
concentration can be thus readily obtained by: 
   =
   
  (ℎ )   (ℎ )
   
  (ℎ )   (ℎ ) +
   
  (ℎ )   (ℎ  )
 
where ℎ = 90 eV and ℎ  = 160 eV. Using Yeh and Lindau’s cross-sections63 and the known 
response of the x-ray monochromator at the TEMPO beamline, the spatial map of the Ge concentration, 
shown in Fig. 4(c), is obtained. This is actually the convolution between the real concentration map 
and a Gaussian function with a full width half maximum (FWHM) determined by the lateral resolution 
of the microscope. De-convolution of the experimentally measured concentration profile across a single 
150 nm wide stripe, using the combination of a Van Cittert method64 and a Lanczos filter65, allowed to 
estimate a spatial resolution for core level mapping of 96.7 ± 3.5 nm. The nano-stripes are rich in Ge 
and exhibit an almost square concentration profile with an average Ge concentration of 0.91 ± 0.026.- 16 - 
 
APPENDIX B: WORK FUNCTION MAPPING 
The work function, Φ = E0 – EF, where E0 is the vacuum level and EF is the Fermi level of the sample 
surface, has been measured by acquiring XPEEM image series at the photoemission threshold. Fig. 9 
shows the threshold spectra extracted from the Si bulk and from a single nano-stripe. The energy scale 
on the abscissa axis is represented by the final state energy, E, referred to the sample Fermi level, EF.  
If EK denotes the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons measured at the entrance of the imaging 
analyzer, then we can write that:  
E – EF = EK + ΦA, 
where ΦA is the work function of the analyzer. An electron having a binding energy EB with respect to 
EF, excited with photons of energy hν, will have a measured kinetic energy EK given by: 
EK = hν – EB – ΦA. 
At the photoemission threshold we have that hν – EB = Φ, where Φ is the sample work function. Thus, 
the threshold measured kinetic energy   
  is: 
  
 = Φ −Φ , 
and the correspondent final state energy referred to the Fermi level is: 
( −  ) =  Φ. 
The secondary electron energy distributions of Fig. 9 are thus characterized by a sharp threshold 
corresponding to the local work function Φ of the emitting region under consideration. The local work 
function map of the Si substrate and of the SiGe nano-stripes (shown in Fig. 7(c)) has been then 
obtained from the best least-square-fitting of the experimental pixel-by-pixel threshold spectra 
measured over the field of view to the full secondary electron distribution, S(E–EF), described by 
Henke et al.:56

where A is a scaling factor and B is a fitting parameter. The accuracy of Φ using this procedure has 
been estimated to be ± 20 meV.66  
The de-convolution of the experimentally measured work function profile across a single 150 
nm wide stripe from a Gaussian allowed to estimate the spatial resolution to be around 88 nm. The 
work function value measured for the SiGe stripes is Φstripe = 4.85 ± 0.03 eV, larger than the work 
function of a bulk Si0.1Ge0.9 alloy (4.768 ± 0.015 eV) obtained by the weighted sum of the intrinsic 
Si(001) (4.75 eV)58 and Ge(001) (4.77 eV)59.- 17 - 
 
We exclude work function changes due to oxidation of germanium67 on the SiGe nano-stripes 
since no chemical shifted structures appears at the low kinetic energy side in the Ge 3d spectrum (see 
Fig. 2). 
 
 
APPENDIX C: STRAIN DETERMINATION FROM TERS 
 
C.1 Strain-induced modification of Raman polarizability  
In SiGe structures heteroepitaxially grown on Si substrates the presence of strain due to the lattice 
deformation between the SiGe alloy and the Si bulk induces a shift of the Raman peaks.40 In diamond 
lattice crystals as Si and Ge the q = 0 Raman active optical phonon is triply degenerate and is 
composed by two transversal modes (TO1 and TO2) and one longitudinal mode (LO). The breaking of 
the cubic symmetry induced by the lattice distortion is able to lift the degeneracy resulting in a 
frequency splitting and in a modification of the Raman polarizability tensors,   , of the three modes37 
(where i = 1 (TO1), 2 (TO2), and 3 (LO)).    tensor have the following matrix representation in the 
crystal reference framework identified by the [100] (x’-axis), [010] (y’-axis) and [001] (z-axis) 
directions:

The detailed procedure to get the split mode frequencies and the strain-modified Raman polarizability 
tensors can be found in a number of references (see Ref 37 for a review). Here we give only a brief 
overview of it, sufficient for the purpose of the present work.  
Due to the stripe morphology and geometry we consider a diagonal representation of the stress 
tensor experienced by the SiGe material of the stripe within the stripe reference framework identified 
by the [110] (x-axis), [1-10] (y-axis) and [001] (z-axis) crystallographic directions:

The frequency splitting for the ith mode,   , is obtained by the eigenvalues    of the symmetric matrix 
 ,68 which couples the phonon deformation potentials with the strain components expressed within the 
crystal reference framework (x’:[100], y’:[010], z’:[001]):- 18 -

reference framework (x:[110], y:[1-10], z:[001]) needs to be consequently transformed according to:

The eigenvalues    (where i = 1 (TO1), 2 (TO2), and 3 (LO)) of the matrix   can be thus directly 
correlated to the components of the strain components    ,    , and    :

C.2 Raman selection rules in Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy  
The strain induced variation of the frequency of the q = 0 optical phonon can be obtained by the split 
mode frequencies of those modes that are actually excited within the given experimental geometry as 
determined by the Raman selection rules.68 In case of standard confocal far-field Raman spectroscopy 
in backscattered configuration only the longitudinal mode is excited.38 In case of a near-field TERS 
experiment, where a metal tip in tunneling contact with the sample surface is used as an optical 
antenna, the Raman polarizability tensors are modified by the presence of the tip leading to a 
modification of the selection rules. To address the problem we used two different approaches: the first 
is based on a simple phenomenological model, while the second follows the electromagnetic theory of 
near-field Raman enhancement in a two-dimensional geometry. It is worth noting that both approaches 
lead to the same qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating that in a TERS experiment in 
oblique backscattered configuration the signal essentially depends by the two transversal modes, which 
are preferentially excited (with the same probability) with respect to the longitudinal one. 
 
C.2.1 Simple model  
Ossikovski et al.39 have recently proposed a simple model based on the introduction of a “tip-
amplication tensor”,  , accounting for the interaction of the tip with the electromagnetic field and 
considering that the electric field component parallel to the tip axis is preferentially amplified- 20 - 
 
compared with that perpendicular to it. Assuming the tip axis along the z-axis, the tensor   has the 
following diagonal representation: 
 =  
 
0
0
0
 
0
0
0
 
  
where a and b are phenomenological tip-amplification factors (with a > b). They are physically related 
to the longitudinal and transversal tip’s polarizability, respectively, and quantitatively depend on the tip 
geometry and material dielectric constant. The “effective” Raman polarizability tensors in presence of 
the tip,   
∗∗, are thus obtained by the following relation:39 
  
∗∗=     
∗ , 
which represents the action of the tip on both the incident and the scattered fields.   
∗∗ are thus given by 
the following matrix expressions: 
  
∗∗= 1

The intensity    of the scattered radiation from the ith mode is given by the selection rule expression:68

where  
  =    
0
cos  
sin  
  
is the electric field of the incident electromagnetic radiation (far field) and   is the incidence angle of 
the light with respect to the z-axis. The scattered intensities for the three phonon modes are thus given 
by the following expressions: 
  =   ∝(  ) (2 sin ϑ + cos ϑ) 
  ∝  cos ϑ 
Considering  = 65° and a typical value of   
⁄
≈5.5,30 the ratio     
⁄  is ≈10   and thus the signal 
essentially depends by the two transversal modes, which are preferentially excited (with the same 
probability) with respect to the longitudinal one. 
 
C.2.2 Electromagnetic theory of field enhancement 
In this section the Raman selection rules are derived by developing an electromagnetic theory of the 
field enhancement following the formalism reported by Cancado et al..70 Fig. 10(a) shows the- 21 - 
 
experimental configuration and the coordinates used in the theoretical analysis. The electric field of the 
incident electromagnetic radiation,   , is amplified and localized by the tip. The total electric field is 
thus represented by the superposition of the incident laser field and of the localized field generated by 
the tip acting as an optical antenna. Nearby the tip the electric field resembles the field of an induced 
dipole located at the center of a small sphere of radius R: 
 (  ,  ) ≈  ( ,  ) +   
      ( ,   ;  )    ( )  ( ,  ) 
where    represents the free-space dyadic Green’s function in absence of a tip,      is the tip’s 
polarizability, and c is the vacuum speed of the light. In the following we can neglect the field    in the 
previous equation since the near field due to the tip is generally much stronger. The tip’s polarizability 
has the following matrix representation:

in the xyz stripe reference framework, where    is the field-enhancement factor and the transverse 
polarizability components correspond to the quasi-static polarizability of a small sphere. The free-space 
dyadic Green’s function is defined in the electromagnetic theory by the electric field generating by a 
radiating electric dipole.71 The near-field term can be written as: 
  ( ,   ;  ) =
    
4      − + 3  
    
where  =   
⁄  is the wavevector of the electromagnetic field in the free-space, I is the unit dyad,   is 
the absolute value of the vector  =  −   and    is the dyadic product of   with itself. Considering 
the coordinate system defined in Fig. 10(a) and the stripe geometry, the relative position vector   can 
be written in Cartesian coordinate as: 
 =   +   + (Δ +  ) , 
and thus the matrix components of the dyadic Green’s function can be evaluated:

where    is the shifted Raman frequency and   
∗ are the strain-modified Raman polarizability tensors

shifted frequency    is the field generated by the tip’s secondary sources induced by the Raman dipole 
distribution  (  ,   ). In approximation of leading dipole term, the scattered field is thus obtained as:

In case of tip enhanced scattering the polarizability of the metal tip is much stronger along its axis than 
in the transversal plane (  > ( −1) ( + 2)
⁄
), then the intensity of the longitudinal mode,   , is much 
lower than that of the two transversal modes,    and   . Moreover, in hypothesis that   ( ) ≈  (  ) 
and  ( ) ≈ (  ) since  ≈  , we obtain the same quantitative results as found from the simple 
phenomenological model considering that  ∝  ( ) and  ∝

C.2.3 Quantum mechanical approach 
The results obtained in the previous sections are also fully consistent with a quantum mechanical 
expression of the Raman selection rules. Breaking of the translational symmetry due to the presence of- 24 - 
 
the surface lowers the symmetry of the crystal from spherical to cylindrical, and thus only the 
projection of the angular momentum along the z-axis,   , is conserved during the photon-phonon 
scattering process:72

where        
 
,        
  
, and         are the    quantum numbers for the incident photon, the 
scattered photon, and the phonon, respectively. Since the metal tip, which represents the nearfield 
source, can be assimilated to an emitting electric dipole, both incident and scattered photons have null 
   quantum numbers:        
 
=        
  
= 0, and thus        = 0. This means that a strong 
coupling between the near-field radiation and the crystal lattice is allowed only for lattice vibrations 
with polarization along the z-axis and angular and linear momenta completely lying in the xy plane, i.e. 
only for transversal modes. 
 
C.3 Strain determination 
The frequency splitting for the ith mode,   , is related to the corresponding eigenvalue    of the   
matrix by the following expression: 
  
 =   
 +    
and thus 
Δ  = (  −  ) ≈  
2  
 
where    is the unstrained mode frequency. From the Raman selection rules in TERS case we derived 
that the q = 0 Raman optical phonon peaks in the measured TERS spectra are featured by a 
superposition of the only two lineshapes associated to the transversal modes TO1 and TO2. Since they 
are excited with the same probability, the strain induced frequency shift, ∆ =  −  , can be simply 
obtained by the average of the TO1 and TO2 mode frequency splittings:73,74 
Δ ≈Δ  + Δ

and then, using the strain dependent expression of    and    (see Section S.2.1): 
Δ ≈

 ( +  ) +       
This relation can be conveniently expressed as a function of the trace of the strain tensor     +

The phonon deformation potentials p and q can be then represented using adimensional quantity

Considering that    ≈    for high Ge content SiGe alloy38,41 (as in the case of the nano-stripes

to the following expression of the strain induced frequency shift:

APPENDIX D: DFT-LDA CALCULATIONS 
We addressed the structural and electronic properties of Ge(001) by means of the density-functional 
theory (DFT), using the plane-wave pseudopotential method and the local density approximation 
(LDA) for the exchange-correlation potential, whose accuracy have been demonstrated in a variety of 
systems.75,76 The well-known tendency of DFT-LDA to underestimate the gaps of semiconductors77 is 
not a significant issue for the present calculations, where we address mainly changes in band energies 
as a function of (small) strains. Disagreement with experimental determinations of the strain variation 
of the valence bandwidth were reported,78 but are probably less relevant for the positions of levels near 
the Fermi energy. We adopt a Perdew-Zunger LDA functional,79 a norm-conserving scalar-relativistic 
pseudopotential, and a 30 Ry (408 eV) cutoff for the plane-wave basis.  
The simulations are carried out in a standard supercell geometry. The conventional cell bulk 
lattice parameter is a = 561.6 pm, as obtained by a full relaxation of the bulk structure, slightly shorter 
than experiment. The supercell is 2×1 to accommodate the b(2×1) surface reconstruction.80 The k-point 
mesh involves 4×8 points, including Γ. The slab representing the surface consists of 10 fixed layers 
plus 3 surface layers on each side, where atoms are fully allowed to relax in all directions, until all- 26 - 
 
force components are smaller than 0.4 pN. All computed band energies are referred to the vacuum 
reference potential outside the solid. This reference potential is determined by averaging the Hartree 
potential over a vacuum region at the middle between two copies of the periodically repeated 2.15 nm-
thick Ge slab. A relatively thick (2.34 nm) vacuum region between periodic copies of the Ge slab 
makes the potential almost costant (within 0.01 meV) over a 1 nm -thick region there. Strain is applied 
by increasing the cell sides by 1%. The atomic positions of the surface layers relax in all strained 
geometries, which implies that the z-oriented strain affects mostly the bulk layers. While the 
calculations are carried out for intrinsic Ge, as the Ge stripes are immersed in a n+ Si host, the Fermi 
level is to be taken to be pinned at the lowest bulk conduction states. Accordingly, the most reliable 
estimate of the work function at all regimes of strain is the one obtained by the position of these bulk 
band states referred to the vacuum level. For a tensile strained Ge slab, we found a reduction of the 
surface electrostatic dipole at the surface, but at the same time a shift of both the Fermi level and the 
conduction band opposite to the surface dipole decrease. 
It is worth noting that DFT calculations have been performed considering a perfectly ordered 
surface. However, on a real surface local disorder and defects allow relaxation of the atomic density 
toward its ideal value. Thus, the surface dipole could be less sensitive to the strain than predicted by the 
calculations, leading to a higher work function shift. Moreover an additional surface barrier, not 
directly taken into account in the DFT calculations, is experienced by an electron escaping from the 
nano-stripe surface. This barrier is induced by a negative charge layer formed at the nano-stripe surface 
due to a redistribution of the space charge accumulating at the Si/SiGe interface as a consequence of 
the band bending following the thermal equilibrium condition at the heterojunction. Considering the 
given doping level and Si/Ge natural band offset we estimate that the order of magnitude of this barrier 
is around 10 meV, which is within the experimental uncertainty for the measured work function value. 
This suggests that both strain and space charge arguments are consistent with an increase of the work 
function for the nano-stripes with respect to the bulk case, as experimentally obtained by XPEEM, and 
that our DFT calculations are thus able to correctly describe the strain-induced electronic structure 
changes inside the stripe. 
 
APPENDIX E: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF FEM SIMULATIONS 
In this section we address whether the idealized shape of the interface between the SiGe stripe and the 
Si substrate, used in the theoretical FEM simulations and exploited to extract the strain tensor, could- 27 - 
 
significantly alter the results. This is particularly important in the present scenario where the relevance 
of our experimental work relies on its consistency with the Finite Element Modeling (FEM). Thus we 
have devoted some extra-simulations to further elucidate this point.  
The hydrostatic strain map reported in Fig. 5(b) is represented again in Fig. 11(a), on a strain 
scale convenient to perform the comparison that follows. Let us start from a simple observation: if we 
remove the whole dislocation net, we obtain the new map shown in Fig. 11(b). Obviously, the strain 
field close to the lower interface is very different as elastic relaxation only has little effect, so that in the 
absence of linear defects the misfit strain is basically maintained. However, the hydrostatic strain close 
to the upper free surface, i.e. the only one relevant for nanoelectronics tensor application and detected 
by TERS, is tensile exactly as in Fig. 11(a), and also rather close in value. We recall that one of the 
main points of the paper is to show that the present nano-structuring allows for a hydrostatic tensile 
strain significantly higher than the typical thermal one in flat films (of the order of 0.1%). In this 
respect, to get the main effect one does not need to explicitly consider dislocations. This allows us to 
investigate systematically the effect of the stripe shape and interface profile, as elastic calculations are 
much faster than the combined elastic-plastic simulations as the one reported in Fig. 11(a). So, in Figs. 
11(c)-(f) we considered different shapes and profiles: the structures shown in (c) and (d) are perhaps 
closer to the experimental one reported in Fig. 1, in (e) we are considering a fully rounded shape, while 
in (f) we report the results for the case of a wavy interface. In all shown simulations, the hydrostatic 
strain close to the upper free surface is clearly always of the same order, around 0.3%. Accordingly, we 
deduce that the main conclusions of our work depend very mildly on: 
a) 
the detailed dislocation distribution/density, etc. 
b) 
the actual details of the stripe shape and interface profile (obviously, for a given vertical-to-
horizontal aspect ratio). 
Thus our choice of an idealized rectangular shape seems to be well justified.- 28 -

stripes. Panel (b) Cross-section SEM image of a single nano-stripe after focused ion beam (FIB) processing. 
During FIB processing the ion beam hits the sample surface with an incidence angle of 52° with respect to the 
normal direction. In this condition the cross-section profile of the nano-stripe can be well distinguished by 
possible ion-induced artifacts due to the amorphization of the cross-section surface, which could appear only 
along the 52° tilted direction.- 29 -
