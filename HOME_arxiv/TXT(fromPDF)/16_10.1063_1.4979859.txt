Abstract 
In this paper strain transfer efficiencies from single crystalline piezoelectric lead 
magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) substrate to a GaAs semiconductor membrane bonded on 
top are investigated using state-of-the-art x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and finite-element-
method (FEM) simulations. Two different bonding techniques are studied, namely gold-thermo-
compression and polymer-based SU8 bonding.  Our results show a much higher strain-transfer for the 
“soft” SU8 bonding in comparison to the “hard” bonding via gold-thermo-compression. A comparison 
between the XRD results and FEM simulations allows to explain this unexpected result with the 
presence of complex interface structures between the different layers. 
1. Introduction 
Piezoelectric materials have gained importance in terms of reversibly transferring strain to other 
materials, especially semiconductors, for the purpose of tuning the electrical and optical properties 
(Shayegan et al., 2003; Seidl et al., 2006).  
The magnitude of strain induced in this way is directly proportional to the electric field applied across 
the piezoelectric material, making use of the converse piezoelectric effect (Kholkin et al., 2008). In 
the past several years, devices using this approach have been extensively studied to tune the optical 
emission spectra of direct band-gap semiconductors (Trotta et al., 2012; Huo et al., 2013; Zhang et 
al., 2013; Plumhof et al., 2013; Trotta et al., 2015; Martín-Sánchez et al., 2016; Seidl et al., 2006; 
Kremer et al., 2014). The design of these devices has become more and more refined, which finally 
allows the choice of the preferred orientation of the transferred strain (Trotta et al., 2015; Trotta et al., 
2016;  Martín-Sánchez et al., 2016). The techniques used to bond the semiconductor on the2 
 
piezoelectric substrate are mostly gold-thermo-compression or bonding mediated by a comparatively 
“soft” polymer. 
One of the major issues for an efficient strain transfer between the piezoelectric substrate and the 
semiconductor membrane seems to be the stiffness of the bonding interlayer which is mainly 
determined by the material’s Young’s modulus. In this regard, a good choice is to bond the membrane 
with a gold interlayer by gold-thermo-compression bonding (Kurman & Mita, 1992). However, 
relatively high mechanical pressures of about 10 MPa are usually required to ensure a good bonding 
quality. This is especially relevant when working with fragile substrates or complex device layouts 
where mechanical pressures in the order of only 1 kPa would be desirable (see (Trotta et al., 2015)). A 
convenient “soft” approach is based on polymer-based SU8 bonding with a relatively high Young 
modulus in the order of about 5 GPa when thermally treated at temperatures above 180 °C. In 
addition, the SU8 polymer is commonly used as a photoresist for many processes involving 
lithography and bonding (LaBianca & Gelorme, 1995; Cremers et al., 2001; Nallani et al., 2003; Yu 
et al., 2006).  
Here, we investigate the strain transfer capabilities of gold and SU8 bonding interlayers by x-ray 
diffraction measurements on 330-nm-thick GaAs membranes bonded on single crystalline PMN-PT 
piezo-actuators. The strain transfer is analyzed by simultaneously acquiring the XRD reciprocal space 
maps of the bonded semiconductor film and the underlying single crystalline PMN-PT for different 
electric fields applied to the PMN-PT substrate. The results presented in this work provide in-depth 
understanding of the assets and weaknesses of the gold-thermo-compression and SU8 bonding 
techniques for an optimized exploitation of hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices. 
 
2. Sample layout and fabrication  
The investigated devices are composed of a stack of three individual parts and share a common 
layout. The first layer is a gold-plated AlN chip carrier for electrically contacting the device, followed 
by the piezoelectric actuator consisting of a 225-µm-thick PMN-PT substrate and, as third layer, the 
330 nm thick GaAs membrane on top; cross-sections of the devices can be seen in Fig. 1(a) and (b), 
respectively.  
The piezoelectric material PMN-PT with the composition of [Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3]0.71-[PbTiO3]0.29 is 
used due to its high piezoelectric coupling coefficients, compared to other commonly used 
ferroelectrics, such as lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), and lead-zirconate-niobate (PZN) (Park & 
Shrout, 1997; Jiang et al., 2003). It also presents good piezoelectric response at  cryogenic 
temperatures which is very interesting for fundamental studies (Herklotz et al., 2010; Bukhari et al., 
2014). The single crystalline PMN-PT in general has a perovskite structure (Slodczyk & Colomban,3 
 
2010) and in the composition that was used, x-ray diffraction measurements showed that the material 
was in a monoclinic phase (Singh et al., 2006) with measured lattice constants of a = b = 5.68 ± 
0.01 Å and c = 4.03 ± 0.01Å. 
The first fabrication step is the metallization of the PMN-PT substrate on both sides by depositing a 
[Cr (10 nm) - Au (100 nm)] bi-layer for electrical contacting. The membrane is part of a multilayer 
structure [GaAs[001] substrate - Al0.7Ga0.3As(50nm) - GaAs (330nm) membrane], which is epitaxially 
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and then coated by thermal evaporation with the same [Cr 
(10 nm) - Au (100 nm)] bi-layer. This layer serves both as a bonding layer and for protection of the 
membrane during the processing. In addition, the metallization of the semiconductor layer increases 
the spectral emission efficiency by acting as a mirror, which is important for optical measurements. 
The next step is the bonding procedure, where the multi-layer structure containing the GaAs 
membrane is bonded on the PMN-PT substrate via gold-thermo-compression or SU8 bonding.  In the 
case of gold-thermo-compression bonding, the semiconductor layer and the piezoelectric substrate are 
pressed together with a pressure of ~10 MPa and is simultaneously heated up to 300 °C for 30 
minutes to enhance inter-diffusion of the gold layers and thus to form a uniform bonding layer 
between both parts. For the SU8 bonding, the semiconductor sample is coated with a 500 nm thick 
SU8 polymer by spin-coating and baked for 5 minutes at 90 °C to evaporate solvents present in as-
spinned SU8. Then, the semiconductor is pressed against the PMN-PT substrate by applying a 
comparatively small mechanical pressure of about 10 kPa while keeping a temperature of about 220 
°C for 15 minutes. This step is conducted above the glass-transition-temperature (Feng & Farris, 
2002) and hardens the SU8 for an efficient bonding. It should be mentioned that a void-free bonding 
layer is expected when using SU8, as all possible gaps between the gold-coated piezoelectric- and 
semiconductor-layers are filled during the bonding process, while the SU8 is still “liquid” before the 
final baking step.   
After bonding, the GaAs membrane is released from the grown multilayer structure onto the PMN-PT 
substrate by back-etching. This process consists of three steps: i) rough non-selective chemical 
etching of most of the GaAs substrate with H3PO4 : H2O2 (7:3); ii) removal of the remaining GaAs 
substrate down to the Al0.7Ga0.3As sacrificial layer by selective etching with citric acid: H2O2 (4:1); iii) 
etching of the Al0.7Ga0.3As layer by dipping in hydrofluoric acid (HF - 49%). More details on the 
device fabrication can be found in (Martín-Sánchez et al., 2016). 
Finally, the PMN-PT with the bonded GaAs membrane on top was glued with silver paint onto an 
AlN chip carrier (final sample see Fig. 1(c)). Cross sections of the differently bonded samples are 
shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b). To operate the piezoelectric device, it is necessary first to pole the 
piezoelectric substrate properly. This is done by applying a voltage on top of the substrate 
progressively in steps of 1 V up to a total voltage of 150 V. This leads to a ferroelectric ordering of4 
 
the polarization in the PMN-PT domains. After poling, the applied electric field can either be parallel 
to the net-polarization of the piezoelectric domains or it can point in the opposite direction (anti-
parallel).  Since the piezo actuator is processed in such a way that it is working in the longitudinal 
extension mode along the [001], respectively the z-direction, an electric field parallel to the net-
polarization results in an expansion perpendicular to the surface and an in-plane contraction. Applying 
the electric field in the opposite direction results in a contraction along the z-direction and an in-plane 
expansion, as long as the coercive field (~2 kV/cm for the used material) is not exceeded. To avoid 
such unintentional re-poling, all experiments were carried out in the first configuration with the 
electric field parallel to the polarization direction, i.e., inducing compressive in-plane strains. 
3. X-ray diffraction measurements 
XRD measurements were performed with a semi-commercial setup consisting of a rotating anode 
(Bruker AXS) in combination with XENOCS mirror optics to collimate the beam vertically and 
horizontally, followed by a Ge[220] channel-cut crystal monochromator. The sample was mounted on 
a 6-axis diffractometer (manufactured by Huber diffraction GmbH) with the possibility to apply high 
voltage to the sample during XRD measurements. All experiments were performed in co-planar 
scattering geometry with a high incidence and low exit angle to achieve a small beam footprint on the 
sample. The CuKα1 line was used with the corresponding wavelength of λ=1.5406Å. A final shaping 
of the beam was achieved by using adjustable slits, resulting in a beam size of 0.5×0.5 mm2.  
Reciprocal space maps (RSMs) around the [004] and [224] Bragg peaks of GaAs (on-top) and the 
[002] and [113] Bragg peaks of PMN-PT underneath were recorded using a position sensitive detector 
(Bruker VANTEC 1). Details on reciprocal space and XRD can be found in (Pietsch et al., 2004). All 
reflections were recorded without changing the geometry or moving the sample in the beam. This 
offered the advantage that a direct comparison of the strain induced in the PMN-PT and on the 
corresponding area on top, in the GaAs membrane, could be measured simultaneously. For each 
voltage (corresponding to a certain electric field applied across the piezo) RSMs of the GaAs and 
PMN-PT reflections were recorded. Then, the voltage was increased in a range between 0 V and 200 
V with a step size of 25 V. After each voltage ramp (e.g. 0 V-25 V @ 1 V/sec) there was a break of 
about 20 minutes, which was needed to limit drifting effects of the PMN-PT (Ivan et al., 2011) that 
could result in a blurring of the Bragg-peaks.  
To extract the lattice parameters and hence the strain in each material (GaAs or PMN-PT), the first 
step was a tilt correction applied to all RSMs by shifting the symmetric peak positions to the  = 2/2 
condition. For this purpose, the center-of-mass (COM) position (𝑄⃗ 𝐶𝑂𝑀) from the symmetric RSMs 
[004] and [002] was calculated, as described by the following equation: 
𝑄⃗ 𝐶𝑂𝑀=
1
𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡∑𝐼𝑖𝑄⃗ 𝑖
𝑖5 
 
𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡 is the total integrated intensity of the RSM, the vector 𝑄⃗ 𝑖 is one defined position in the RSM with 
the corresponding intensity 𝐼𝑖 and the index i counting all measured positions in the q-space. The 
angle between the calculated 𝑄⃗ 𝐶𝑂𝑀 position for the sym. RSMs and the crystalline direction (Q⃗⃗ || [001]) 
was used as a ω-offset. This calculated offset was also applied to the asymmetric [224] and [113] 
RSMs, respectively. After the tilt correction, a second COM calculation was performed for the 
asymmetric RSMs [224] and [113] to find the Q-in-plane component, which was finally used for 
evaluation of the in-plane lattice parameters and the corresponding in-plain strain values. Fig. 2 shows 
RSMs of GaAs and PMN-PT and the corresponding calculated 𝑄⃗ 𝐶𝑂𝑀 positions for different voltages 
applied. 
 Due to inhomogeneities in terms of pre-strains (see (Martín-Sánchez et al., 2016)) and tilts after 
bonding (which can be seen in the RSMs as peak-broadening, distortions or side maxima), using the 
COM calculation was necessary to reproducibly track the parts in the RSMs which are related to 
strain changes upon bias variations. This is especially true for the RSMs of the thin GaAs membrane 
on-top, where most of the inhomogeneities are induced during the bonding procedure. The peak-
broadening in the RSMs measured for PMN-PT is attributed to the presence of multiple domains with 
a small but finite angular orientation distribution (“mosaicity”) in the order of 0.2° within the 
illuminated area(see Fig. 2). Peak-width effects are the main contribution to the error of the measured 
strain component. Atomic force images (AFM) taken from the polished PMN-PT surface are 
discussed in detail in the next section and confirm the presence of these domains. 
4. Discussion of results and simulations 
Summarizing the results from the XRD measurements, in Fig. 3 the changes of the in-plane strain 
component for both bonding techniques and different electric fields applied can be seen. The strain 
changes in the bonded GaAs membrane are for both bonding techniques lower than the ones measured 
in the PMN-PT actuator which indicates that the strain transfer is not perfect, i.e., the ratio of the 
strain changes is smaller than 100%. By calculating a linear regression for each set of data-points, a 
characteristic slope (∆ε/F) can be obtained which makes it possible to quantify the strain transfer 
rates. The calculated slopes with their corresponding errors and the transfer efficiencies (strain 
induced in the PMN-PT actuator equals 100%) are given in Table 1. Interestingly, the sample bonded 
via the SU8 coating shows a much higher transfer efficiency (69%) than for gold thermo-compression 
bonding (25%) although the Young’s modulus of hardened SU8 (≈2-4GPa (Gao et al., 2010)) is about 
20 times lower than the modulus of a thin gold layer (≈60-70Gpa (Birleanu et al., 2016)). This seems 
counterintuitive in the first place, as one might think that a harder layer results in a higher strain 
transfer, while the opposite is observed here. The bonding efficiency is actually very sensitive to the 
interface properties which will be discussed below and just looking at the material parameters is not 
sufficient to understand and model the strain transfer correctly. We note that an almost complete6 
 
strain-transfer was previously reported for epoxy-glued samples in (Shayegan et al., 2003), although 
the reached strain levels were about an order of magnitude lower than those achieved here.                                              
FEM simulations for different materials used as bonding layers and various interface-structures were 
performed to allow a deeper understanding of the strain losses. The first step was to transfer the 
device to an idealized model by rebuilding each individual layer using the appropriate elastic material 
constants and preserving the original length scales of the device. The material parameters were taken 
for: PMN-PT from (Luo et al., 2008); the polymer SU8 from (Feng & Farris, 2002); the thin gold 
layers from (Birleanu et al., 2016) and the GaAs layer from (Levinshtein et al., 1996). All materials 
used were assumed to be linear-elastic. 
Interestingly, the choice of the material mediating the bonding process (gold or SU8), had no 
significant influence on the simulated strain transferred from the piezo to the semiconductor, 
assuming perfectly bonded interfaces. The strain transfer is always 100%. Even for much softer 
hypothetic bonding materials such as rubber-like silicone polymers (Lötters et al., 1997) (Young’s 
Moduli of about two orders of magnitude lower than the Modulus of SU8), no significant strain losses 
could be observed in the FEM simulations. This, on first sight counter-intuitive, behaviour can be 
understood considering the dimensions of the structure in terms of length scales. If the layer-thickness 
is much smaller than the lateral dimensions of the structure (which is the case here, since layer 
thicknesses are in the range of 10-7 m while lateral dimensions are about 10-3m) the elastic strain 
induced and transferred by the individual layers has no possibility to relax except at the edge regions 
of the structure. Hence, only at the edges (on length scales similar to the top layer thicknesses) 
significant strain losses are observed due to elastic relaxations, whereas in the sample center the strain 
is transferred without any losses from the piezo carrier to the semiconductor membrane, regardless of 
the materials used for bonding. Strain relaxation is thus relevant only close to structure edges (Zander 
et al., 2009) or for structures with high aspect ratio (Kremer et al., 2014). This is of course true only 
within the elastic limit, i.e., if no plastic relaxations or crack formations occur. For Au bonding, this 
should be the case for the material constants and strain ranges in the order of 0.1%. For SU8, we will 
discuss this limit below. 
In Fig. 4 simulations of the strain transfer efficiency (TE) for the in-plane strain component along the 
surface can be seen. The edge effect is clearly visible, whereas the bulk is strained uniformly. The 
strain transfer efficiency is quantified by color-coding the relative difference of a strain component 
(yy) in the GaAs and PMN-PT which is given by: 
 
TE = 
𝜀𝑦𝑦(𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)
𝜀𝑦𝑦(𝑃𝑀𝑁−𝑃𝑇)  
 yy(Simulation) is the simulated strain value and yy(PMN-PT) the strain induced in the PMN-PT 
substrate. For the maximum of 100% strain transfer, yy(Simulation) equals yy(PMN-PT).7 
 
  
In contrast to the simulations, the measured strain losses for the bulk are considerable and can be 
explained by a more complicated interface structure. For this purpose, AFM measurements of the 
PMN-PT surface before and after gold coating were performed and revealed a domain-like structure 
even though the PMN-PT is purchased as single crystalline material. This domain-like structure 
appears after the surface of the piezo material is polished to reduce the initial roughness and is also 
responsible for the mosaicity observed in XRD. The metallization of the piezo crystal does not bury or 
smoothen the observed domains, it conformably reproduces the PMN-PT surface texture on the 
surface of the 100-nm-thick gold layer, as shown in Fig. 5. The lateral size of a single domain is in the 
range of 1µm with a peak-to-valley height of about 4-6 nm. This could lead to void areas, when the 
two Au-coated surfaces are brought into contact during the bonding process, resulting in a bonding 
surface area significantly below 100%. SEM images of cross-sections through gold bonded devices 
fabricated in the same way can be found in (Trotta et al., 2012) and clearly confirm the presence of 
void areas where no bonding could be established. Thus, qualitative simulations on imperfect bonding 
interfaces were performed to explore the effect of strain losses due to void areas. In Fig. 6 simulations 
of a rough surface and its effect on the transfer efficiency can be seen. The rough surfaces have been 
qualitatively reproduced replacing the perfect bonding-layers by a regular pattern of truncated 
pyramids on both bonding faces. The top areas of the truncated pyramids from the gold-coated piezo 
and the mirrored ones from the gold-coated semiconductor are assumed to be in perfect contact, 
whereas the area between the truncated pyramids represents the voids. By changing the size of the top 
facets of the truncated pyramids, it is possible to continuously simulate a global bonding ratio 
between 100% (perfect bonding, whole area in contact) and 0% (no bonding established). The void 
parts or inhomogeneities introduced with the pyramid-like surface pattern creates “micro-edge” 
effects on every imperfect bonding domain and allows a partial relaxation of the induced strain. That 
is why the presence of defects or inhomogeneities is crucial for the relaxation of strain and hence to 
explain the losses in transferred strain. The effect of bonding inhomogeneities on the transferred strain 
can be seen in Fig.7, which reveals that the transfer efficiencies are directly correlated to the bonded 
area. 
Hence in the case of gold-bonding the losses in strain can be very well explained by a reduction of the 
effective bonding area due to the intrinsic domain structure of the piezo carrier and a possible 
additional roughness induced during gold deposition. The efficiency of strain transfer for a particular 
sample depends, however, on the particular details of the bonding surfaces and cannot easily be 
predicted quantitatively.  
For the SU8 bonded samples, the domain structure of the piezo substrate should not have any 
influence because the liquid SU8 could compensate the surface roughness by filling up all gaps, 
qualitatively explaining a higher strain transfer. However, also for SU8 bonding, the strain transfer is8 
 
significantly below 100%, i.e. also in this case, the bonding layer cannot be homogeneous and 
continuous.  Taking a closer look at the stress components in the bonding layer for measured values of 
strain induced in the piezo material, one can see that the elastic limit of the SU8 (65-100MPa 
(Spratley et al., 2007)) is exceeded at the sample edges or “defects” in the interface. We believe that 
any such defects or inhomogeneities must trigger plastic deformation or the formation of small cracks, 
i.e., lead to a certain degree of plastic relaxation. This most probably occurs already during the first 
poling of the device, which needs to be done after the high temperature bonding step where the Curie-
temperature TC ≈ 127° of PMN-PT (Herklotz et al., 2010) is exceeded. Afterwards, the partly 
plastically relaxed SU8 layer behaves elastically. I.e., during cycling the applied voltage several times 
over the full range the same strain state is reached for the same applied bias reproducibly. A direct 
confirmation of this assumption, e.g. by SEM inspection of cross-section specimen is difficult since 
the interfaces are hard to access while the devices are working. Further investigations are currently in 
progress. 
5. Conclusion 
X-ray diffraction measurements clearly show that the devices fabricated with SU8 as bonding layer 
show a superior efficiency in terms of strain transfer compared to the devices fabricated with gold-
thermo-compression. Considering the different material constants, the measurements seem to be 
counter-intuitive: a “softer” bonding layer leads to higher transferred strains. Furthermore it should be 
mentioned that the measured strain transfer rates of ≈ 70% for the devices with the “soft” SU8 
bonding layer are even higher than the transfer rates reported for semiconductor-layers epitaxially 
grown on PMN-PT substrates (17% (Bai et al., 2014); 40% (Heo et al., 2016)).  
Simulations on differently modelled bonding-layer-surfaces revealed that the interface structure is 
actually more important than the material parameters of the bonding layer. These imperfect interface 
structures can explain the measured losses in the transferred strain even if detailed quantitative 
simulations are not possible due to the interface complexity. Nevertheless, these simulations still 
allow a deeper understanding of processes involved during the bonding and reveal the reasons for 
losses in transferred strain.  
Each of the studied devices is, of course, individually fabricated and simplified simulation on these 
devices cannot fully predict their behaviour. Therefore, for determining the exact amount of strain 
transferred, direct strain measurements via independent methods such as x-ray diffraction are 
obligatory.9

FIG. 3. Changes of the in-plane strain component (ε‖) for the PMN-PT actuator and the GaAs 
membrane versus electric field, for gold bonding (a) and SU8 bonding (b). The areas marked in red 
represent the loss in strain. The error for the given strain values is around 0.02% and is mainly 
dominated by the finite peak widths in the RSMs due to mosaicity in the piezo actuator and the 
bonded GaAs.13 
 
FIG. 4. Simulations of the in-plane strain (εyy) transfer efficiency (TE) for the SU8 bonded device. It 
is clearly visible that the only losses in transferred strain from the PMN-PT piezo carrier to the GaAs 
membrane on-top are observed in the edge regions. The effect of strain loss is observed for all edges 
but only the strain component (εyy) along the y-axis is plotted which explains the asymmetry. For a 
perfectly bonded device, as shown, the observed losses along the edges are only a few tenth of a 
percent, see colour scale. The piezo actuator was set to a compressive strain of -0.1%, which was the 
maximum measured strain (at 200V applied bias).14

clearly seen. The inset shows a height profile along a 5µm line along the surface and allows an 
estimation of the valley-to-peak distances between the individual domains which is about 4-6 nm. 
    
FIG. 6. Simulations of the in-plane strain (εyy) transfer efficiency (TE) for a patterned bonding layer 
with an array of truncated pyramids mimicking a rough surface. In the simulation shown in the left 
panel, only 10% of the total area contributes to the bonding. The size of one bonding element in this 
simulation is about 1µm x 1µm, which is in the range of the measured domain-sizes; the total lateral 
model size was reduced due to limited computing power. The reduction of the lateral dimensions lead, 
as expected, to very prominent edge effects visible along the y-direction for the simulated strain 
component εyy. Nevertheless, also in the centre of the structures an overall reduction of the transferred 
in-plane strain can be observed.15 
 
FIG. 7. Average strain transfer obtained from a volume-integration in the GaAs layer over the region 
(12 µm x 12 µm) marked in the inset which is not affected by the edge effect. The plot is normalized 
to 100% strain transfer at 100% bonding area to further eliminate any remainder of edge relaxation 
effects. The plot confirms that a reduction of the bonding area due to domain-like bonding elements 
leads to substantial losses in transferred strain.
