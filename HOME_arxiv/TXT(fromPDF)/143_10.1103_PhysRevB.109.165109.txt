As one of the most intriguing states of matter, the chiral spin liquid (CSL) has attracted much
scientific interest while its existence and mechanism in crystalline strongly correlated systems remain
hotly debated. On the other hand, strong correlation driven emergent phenomena can be realized
in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers with a tremendously tunable large length scale
providing a new platform for the emergence of CSLs. We focus on a strongly correlated model
relevant to heterobilayer WSe2/MoSe2 and investigate the Mott insulating phase at half filling
under an out-of-plane magnetic field.
Considering both its orbital and spin Zeeman effects we
identify three conventionally ordered phases including a 120◦N´eel phase, a stripe phase, and an
up-up-down phase. For intermediate fields an emergent quantum spin liquid phase is identified with
partial spin polarization. We further characterize its topological nature as the ν = 1/2 Laughlin
CSL through the topological entanglement spectrum and quantized spin pumping under spin flux
insertion. In addition, we map out the quantum phase diagram for different twisted angles in an
experimentally accessible parameter regime.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Quantum spin liquids [1–4] (QSLs) are exotic states
of matter that feature non-trivial topology [5–7] and
fractionalized excitations [8].
The novel properties of
QSLs have attracted numerous studies for several decades
which provide potential ways to realize unconventional
superconductivity through doping QSLs [9–12], and en-
able topological quantum computation [13, 14]. Further-
more, it has been proposed that the behaviors of many
more exotic correlated electronic systems such as the
holon Wigner crystal and strange metal can be under-
stood from the perspective of doping QSLs [15–17]. How-
ever, candidate materials of QSLs are very rare partially
because of the lack of definite evidence to detect QSLs in
experiments.
As a promising example, the chiral spin liquid (CSL)
carries a quantized chiral edge current that realizes the
bosonic version of the fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE). As a result, CSL may be identified through the
quantized thermal Hall conductivity [18–20]. Upon dop-
ing, CSL can lead to topological superconductivity [21]
that supports Majorana edge excitations, responsible for
edge zero-biased peaks in experiments [22].
Recently,
such novel states have been found numerically on re-
alistic triangular lattice models such as the Hubbard
model [23, 24], and the extended Heisenberg model [25]
supplemented by three-spin chiral interactions [26–29]
or four-spin ring exchanges [30]. However, higher-order
terms that involve more spins are generally small in per-
turbation theory and cannot be tuned without consid-
ering the interplay among different effective spin inter-
∗jxzhu@lanl.gov
actions. Furthermore, the range of relative strength be-
tween nearest neighbor and further neighbor interactions
is not fully accessible for most candidate materials that
show spin-liquid like behaviors [31–38]. Thus, the numer-
ical identification for CSLs based on real material param-
eters remains inconclusive.
Recently, it has been proposed that twisted transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers can simulate Hub-
bard model physics with tunable interacting strengths
by different twisted angles [39–43].
In particular, the
WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayer has a single flat band that
can be isolated with hole doping, leading to an effective
Hubbard model with competing interactions on triangu-
lar moir´e superlattices [39]. Even more appealingly, ow-
ing to the significantly larger unit cell, an experimentally
accessible magnetic field can generate large magnetic flux
per unit cell to induce strong effective chiral interactions
that are impossible in conventional solid state crystalline
systems [27, 44–47]. However, considering the Zeeman
term the system energy can be reduced by flipping the
spins into a partially polarized state, which makes the
non-magnetic CSL, a robust quantum Hall state [28], an
excited state. Thus, whether the ground state can be a
CSL with a quantized Chern number in a finite magne-
tization state remains an open question.
Motivated by the possible field induced chiral spin
liquids in TMD moir´e systems, we study the emergent
phases of the half-filled Hubbard model in the pres-
ence of an applied out-of-plane magnetic field based
on
the
parameters
of
the
WSe2/MoSe2
moir´e
bi-
layer. Through large-scale density matrix renormaliza-
tion group (DMRG) simulations [48, 49] and consider-
ing both orbital and spin Zeeman effects of the mag-
netic field, we identify a CSL with partial spin polariza-
tion [50] at intermediate magnetic fields. In particular,
the topological nature of the CSL is identified as the ν =
arXiv:2306.03056v2  [cond-mat.str-el]  7 Apr 20242
1/2 FQHE through spin flux insertion simulations and a
topological entanglement spectrum. We also show that
the Chern number remains almost quantized in the pres-
ence of weak disorders. Applicable to the WSe2/MoSe2
heterobilayer setting, we map out the global quantum
phase diagram using experimentally tunable parameters
which are twisted angles and magnetic fields.
Besides
CSL, we identify stripe and up-up-down (UUD) phases
with finite magnetization at larger magnetic fields, as well
as a 120◦N´eel phase at smaller fields. Our results show
that the interplay between orbital and spin effects of the
applied magnetic field gives rise to a partially polarized-
CSL (PP-CSL), which is stabilized in an experimentally
accessible parameter regime. The robust Chern number
in finite magnetization and disorder is relevant to the
plateau of quantized thermal Hall conductance [18, 20]
and can be tested in TMD moir´e systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In
Sec. II, we introduce the effective spin model and numer-
ical methods used in this work. In Sec. III, we present
our main findings in the phase diagram including var-
ious magnetic phases and an emergent PP-CSL phase.
In Sec. IV, we further show numerical evidence of the
magnetic phases. In Sec. V, we elucidate the nature of
the PP-CSL from the entanglement spectrum and the
quantized spin pumping via spin flux insertion, which is
robust even under a weak disorder. We also discuss the
stripelike spin polarization in the CSL phase. In Sec. VI,
we give a summary and discussion.

MODELS AND METHODS
Considering a heterobilayer with similar lattice con-
stants like WSe2/MoSe2, the moir´e pattern can be
formed with a large moir´e lattice constant am and a small
twisted angle θm [40]. Following Ref. [39], the low-energy
bands can be approximated by a single-band Hubbard
model with only spin degeneracy, where the Hamiltonian
is given as

where we consider the nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping t1,
next-NN hopping t2, and the on-site Coulomb repulsion
U. An applied out-of-plane magnetic field affects both
the orbital as the vector potential ∇× A = B, and the
spin as the Zeeman effect hz = 1
2µBgsB, where µB is the
Bohr magneton and the spin g-factor gs ≈2.
At half filling of the moir´e bands U is much larger
than t1 [39], thus the charges are localized in the Mott
insulating state. The effective spin model can be derived
from the perturbation expansion of t/U [51] with effective
three-spin chiral interactions [45] from the magnetic flux.

the lattice constant of the triangular moir´e superlattice.
Other chiral interactions originating from ring geometries
beyond the minimal triangular can also slightly enhance
the chiral effect, which are not included here for simplic-
ity.
As a remarkable observation, the enlarged length
scale of am significantly amplifies the orbital effect of
magnetic fields, which in turn enhances chiral spin inter-
actions over that in regular solid state crystalline systems
by orders of magnitude.
We adopt the moir´e lattice constant am dependence
of t1, t2 and U from Ref. [39].
As such, the coupling
parameters in Eq. (2) are ultimately determined by am
and B; see more details in the Supplemental Material
(SM) [52].
We explore different phases by tuning am
between 5.5 and 7.5 nm, and B from 0 up to 17 T, as
explained later.

infinite DMRG methods [53] with U(1) spin symme-
try [54, 55]. In flux insertion simulations, a flux θF is
adiabatically inserted through the cylinder, as illustrated
in Fig. 1 (b). The system has an open boundary in the
ea or x direction and periodic boundary conditions in the
eb or y direction [Fig. 1 (a)], with the number of sites de-
noted as Lx and Ly, respectively. The total number of
sites is N = Lx×Ly. We use finite DMRG with relatively
large system sizes up to N = 360 to access more spin sec-
tors and obtain the B dependence of the magnetization.
Flux insertion simulations are carried out with infinite
DMRG with a smaller unit cell of 144 sites, because flux
insertion does not change the magnetization and the spin
pumping is more robust with infinite DMRG algorithm.
We mainly focus on the results on Ly = 6 cylinders and
the results show almost no finite size effect in the x di-
rection. We keep up to bond dimension M = 6000 to
obtain accurate results with numerical truncation error
ϵ ≲1 × 10−6; see more details in the SM [52].
III.
PHASE DIAGRAM
The ground states of the J1-J2-Jχ model have been ex-
plored without the Zeeman effect, which results in CSLs
with zero magnetization. Our numerical results are con-
sistent with previous work in the range of parameters
studied in Refs. [26, 27] with hz = 0; see more details in
SM [52].
By scanning over the parameter space of Eq. (2) we
establish a global quantum phase diagram spanned by
moir´e lattice constants and magnetic fields [Fig. 1 (c)].
We identify three conventional magnetic phases includ-
ing the 120◦N´eel phase, UUD phase, and stripe phase,

as well as a CSL phase.
The rich quantum phase di-
agram results from frustrations and competing interac-
tions, as the classical phase diagram only has N´eel and
UUD phases but no stripe phase. The stripe phase may
originate purely from the quantum model, where the PP-
CSL also exhibit stripelike polarizations; see more details
of the classical Monte Carlo results in SM [52]. In the
limit of B = 0 T the 120◦N´eel order dominates the
whole range of am, where the nearest-neighbor J1 takes
the leading order, and it smoothly expands to nonzero B
regimes. For a smaller value of am < 5.6 nm, the 120 N´eel
order becomes weak and the ground state might develop
into a spin liquid on wider cylinders [56, 57] which is be-
yond the scope of the current work. At larger B, we find
a stripe phase at small am and an UUD phase at larger
am before the spins become fully polarized. Both phases
exhibit a finite spin polarization in z-direction, which in-
creases as B increases.
In the intermediate B regime
at small am, a CSL with partial polarization emerges.
The topological nature of the CSL is identified as the ν
= 1/2 SU(2)1 Laughlin state through the flux insertion
simulations and the entanglement spectrum. The CSL
extends to smaller am, but we are mainly interested in
am > 5.5 nm, which corresponds to θm ≲3.5◦where
the moir´e band fillings are fully tunable by the electri-
cal gating [39]. The partially polarized stripe and UUD
phases also extend beyond B = 17 T in our model. How-
ever, the energy scale of Zeeman interactions may inter-
fere with other moir´e bands, which goes beyond the scope
of present work. This is especially true considering the
larger g-factor for excitons [58].

spin correlations [Fig. 2 (a)]. Tuning finite B into the
PP-CSL phase, the peaks disperse along the edge of the
Brillouin zone with similar intensities and there is no
distinctive peak [Fig. 2(b)]. By further increasing B into
the stripe phase moderate peaks become concentrated at
the M points [Fig. 2(c)], indicating stripe correlations.
For larger am in the UUD phase there are mild
peaks at the K points [Fig. 2 (d)].
The magnitude
of peaks decreases with increase of B which is consis-
tent with a classical state.

MUUD increases suddenly around B = 9 T at am = 7.2

phase.
The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows the ground state
energy as well as the entanglement entropy. The entan-
glement entropy exhibits a kink near the phase boundary
which is consistent with the first-order phase transition.
Meanwhile, we find smooth changes in energy and magne-
tization near the phase boundary; see SM [52]. The 120◦
N´eel order and the UUD order share the same symme-
try, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of phase
crossover.
Figure 3 (b) shows the structure factor peak at the K
points for various B. Fixing am = 5.6 nm, S(K) has a
sudden drop at B = 5 T, indicating the phase transition
to CSL. Equivalently it could be seen from the peak in
the first order derivative of S(K) in the inset of Fig. 3(b).
The phase transition could also be determined by the
characteristic entanglement spectrum, which is discussed
next.

CHIRAL SPIN LIQUIDS
The entanglement spectrum extracted from the ground
state provides an unbiased way to identify topological
states through the one-to-one correspondence to the gap-
less edge excitation spectrum [60]. In the PP-CSL regime
at am = 5.6 nm, B = 15 T, we find that the entangle-
ment spectrum shows quasidegenerate patterns with de-
creasing momentum on both Ly = 6 and 8, as shown in
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The quasidegenerate
eigenvalues form patterns of {1, 1, 2, 3, ...} in the lowest
two Sz sectors, which agrees with the tower of states of
the spinon sector [61, 62] by the SU(2)1 Wess-Zumino-
Witten theory of the ν = 1/2 Laughlin state.
Higher
degenerate levels are not found because of the limited
discrete momentum number in finite size lattices.
For
CSL, the spinon sector is found as the ground state in
the presence of magnetic fields, where the vacuum sector
has a higher energy.
Besides the entanglement spectrum, the spin flux in-
sertion simulation can also identify the topological na-
ture of the CSL [61, 63]. The spin flux θF is adiabati-
cally inserted through the cylinder which adds a phase
factor S+
i S−
j →ei θF
Ly (ry

j to the spin flip terms
in the y direction. We measure the pumped spin using
the reduced density matrix as Qs = P
α λαSz
α where λα
is the eigenvalue and Sz
α is the corresponding Sz of the
α eigenstate. Thus, the accumulated spin for different
θF is ∆Qs(θF ) = Qs(θF ) −Qs(0). As shown in Fig. 5
(a), the net spin pumping of ∆Qs(θF = 2π) ≈0.5 and
∆Qs(θF = 4π) ≈1 which corresponds to a spin Chern
number C = 0.5 [61], suggesting again the Laughlin type
CSL. This is similar to the 1/3 fractional Chern insulator
in the Haldane honeycomb lattice model [63]. Addition-
ally, we find a disorder-averaged ∆Qs(θF = 4π) ≈1 in
the presence of weak disorder W = 0.01 [Fig. 5 (b)] which
is defined as Hdisorder = P
i wiSz
i with |wi| < W being a
random effective onsite exchange field; see more details
in SM [52]. At larger disorder W > 0.03, it deviates from5
being quantized [64]. In the stripe and 120◦N´eel phases
the spin pumping becomes not quantized [65] but finite
due to a finite non-coplanar chiral order. Additionally,
the spin pumping for the classical UUD phase is almost
0. Thus, phase boundaries between the PP-CSL and the
stripe phase can be determined by the flux insertion as
well as the entanglement spectrum.
Previous studies [27] have found a finite spin gap of
the non-magnetic CSL without the Zeeman term.
We
also obtain the spin-1 gap as ∆s = E0(Stotal
z
= 1) −
E0(Stotal
z
= 0) in the non-magnetic CSL, which can be
used to determine the spin response to the Zeeman field
and partial polarization of the state in the thermody-
namic limit. The spin gap in the bulk is almost the same
for different Lx, showing little finite size effect. In the
thermodynamic limit, if the Zeeman energy of flipping
one spin is larger than the finite spin gap, the CSL is
partially polarized.
We find that the bulk spin gap is
smaller in the whole CSL regime, thus the CSL always
has partial spin polarization. For example, at am = 5.6
nm, B = 15 T a finite stripelike magnetization in the
z direction appears with
1
N
P
x,y(−1)xSz
x,y ≈0.027; see
SM [52] for more details on the magnetization. The CSL
with stripelike polarization and gapless spin excitation is
distinctly different from the gapped non-magnetic CSL
identified in the previous work [27]. Such a stripe has
also been found on the honeycomb [66] and square lattice
models [46] that coexist with CSL. However, in our re-
sults the stripelike spin polarization does not contribute
to the transverse spin correlations, and the correspond-
ing spin structure factor shows no distinctive peak in the
PP-CSL.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have explored magnetic field induced phases in
the TMD moir´e heterobilayer WSe2/MoSe2 by study-
ing a single-band Hubbard model that can be realized
for twisted angles θm ≲3.5 [39].
Through extensive
DMRG simulations on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders,
we map out the global quantum phase diagram spanned
by twisted angles and magnetic fields.
In particular,
we have identified a CSL with partial spin polarization
for intermediate magnetic fields, and showed its robust
Chern number under weak disorder. Furthermore, the
partially polarized CSL is surrounded by three magnetic
phases including the 120◦N´eel phase, UUD phase, and
stripe phase.
The moir´e superlattices with a tremen-
dously large unit cell reduce the required B to generate
strong enough chiral interactions for stabilizing the CSL.
The transition from CSL to stripe phase with further in-
creased B can be qualitatively compared to experiments
of field induced magnetic transitions of spin-liquid-like
phases [67]. For small to intermediate on-site Hubbard
repulsion U the electron charge degrees of freedom can-
not be neglected. Future studies may explore the field in-
duced phases directly on the Hubbard model, where the
CSL may be stabilized for an intermediate U even with-
out B [23, 24]. Besides half filling, other commensurate
fillings of moir´e bands also provide a platform to explore
CSL, where Wigner crystals are formed with charges lo-
calized in triangular and other types of superlattices [68–
72]. Finally, we note that our study might also be rel-
evant to a triangular-based spin- 1
2 metal-organic frame-
work, where the lattice constant can still be much larger
than that of typical crystalline solids.

Supplemental Material for “Magnetic field induced partially polarized chiral spin
liquid in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir´e system”
In the Supplemental Material, we provide more numerical results to support the conclusions we have discussed in
the main text. In Sec. I, we provide examples of the finite bond dimension scaling of the ground state energy as
well as entanglement entropy in the partially polarized-chiral spin lqiuid (PP-CSL) phase and show the numerical
convergence of Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) results. We also show the details of the disorder
averaged spin pumping in the presence of a weak disorder. In Sec. II, we show the magnetization of different phases in
real space. In Sec. III, we show various spin interactions as a function of the moir´e lattice constant am and magnetic
field B. In Sec. IV, we show the phase diagram without considering the Zeeman interactions and compare it with our
main results. In Sec. V, we implement the classical Monte Carlo methods and obtain the classical phase diagram of
the model to compare with our main results. In Sec. VI, we show the magnetization evolution with increasing B from
the 120◦N´eel phase to Up-up-down (UUD) phase. In Sec. VII, we show the evolution of the chiral order for various
B from the 120◦N´eel phase to PP-CSL phase.
I.
DMRG CONVERGENCE
The convergence of DMRG calculation can be examined by the finite bond dimension (M) extrapolation of the
ground state energy. We show the obtained ground-state energy per site E0 versus the inverse DMRG bond dimension
(1/M) for Ly = 6 from both finite DMRG and infinite DMRG results. For finite DMRG, in order to minimize the
boundary effect, we extract the energy using the middle 3/4 (which is Lx/8 < x ≤7Lx/8) of the lattices and calculate
the entanglement entropy using the left and right subsystems divided at Lx/2. We keep the bond dimensions up to
M = 6000. In Fig. S1 (a) and (b), we show the energies EMid
0
and entanglement entropy at am = 5.6 nm, B = 15 T
on Ly = 6 with finite and infinite DMRG results, as an example in the PP-CSL phase. The EMid
0
and entropy are
extrapolated by the second-order polynomials C(1/M) = C(0) + a/M + b/M 2, where C(0) is the extrapolated result
in the infinite M limit. The energies converge smoothly with bond dimension and the extrapolated energies are very
close to the lowest energies we obtain, indicating the good convergence of the results.
The spin flux insertion results in the PP-CSL show slight difference for different M. As shown in Fig. S2(a), the
spin pumping at smaller M = 1200 have large variations due to a finite magnetization and the pumping is less than
1 at θF = 4π. As M increases, the pumping becomes more uniform and the pumped spin is closer to the quantized
value of 1.
In the presence of a disorder, we perform an average over random disorder configurations to obtain the averaged spin
pumping. The results in the main text are calculated with M = 3000 and up to 30 disorder configuration averages.
To examine the numerical convergence we show the disorder averaged spin pumping ∆Qs(θF ) for various number of
random disorder configurations Nconfiguration at W = 0.01 in Fig. S3. For M = 2500 in Fig. S3(a) the ∆Qs(θF = 2π)
remains almost the same for Nconfiguration = 10 to 50, indicating the converged results for disorder average. Similarly
for M = 3000 in Fig. S3(b) the disorder averaged ∆Qs(θF ) is converged with Nconfiguration up to 30. During the
simulations for W = 0.01, we find that although for a small number of disorder configurations the spin pumping has
a sudden drop and becomes much larger than 1, most of the ∆Qs(θF = 2π) at given random disorder configurations
is close to 1. Comparing the results of M =2500, 3000, 3500 in Fig. S2(b) we find that using larger bond dimensions
can reduce the sudden drop of ∆Qs(θF ) and lead to the averaged spin pumping of closer to 1. On the other hand, for
W > 0.03 most of the ∆Qs(θF = 2π) at given random disorder configurations are much larger than 1, which shows
distinct difference from the W = 0.01 results.
II.
MAGNETIZATION IN REAL SPACE FOR DIFFERENT PHASES
We show the magnetization in real space with infinite DMRG for the stripe phase, the PP-CSL phase, the UUD
phase, and the 120◦N´eel phase in Fig. S4 (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. In the stripe phase there are small spin
polarization in z-direction which is stripe-like as shown in Fig. S4(a), consistent with the stripe spin-spin correlations
given in the main text. In the PP-CSL phase [Fig. S4(b)] the stripe-like spin polarization becomes much weaker, and
shows a positive spin polarization on every site. We also notice that the stripe changes direction in the PP-CSL phase.
In the UUD phase the z-component of the spin dominates and the spins in the three-sublattice component form ↑↑↓,
which indicates a classical spin alignment, as shown in Fig. S4(c). For the 120◦N´eel phase at small but finite B we
also find a very small spin polarization as shown in Fig. S4(d). The phase is consistent with the 120◦N´eel order at
B = 0 T where the spin-spin correlations are mainly in the xy plane.9

dependence on am, mainly because as am increases the magnetic flux increases but the interaction strength decreases
at the same time. Since the strength 2hz does not depend on am while J1 decreases as am increases, the Zeeman term
becomes more dominant at large am.
We also show the parameter dependence with fixing am = 5.6 nm. Figure S6 shows the same spin interaction
parameters as Fig. S5, where Jχ/J1 and 2hz/J1 increases as B increases, while J2/J1 remains the same.

PHASE DIAGRAM WITHOUT ZEEMAN INTERACTIONS
To connect with previous numerical studies of the chiral spin liquids on the triangle lattice with finite chiral
interactions, we obtain the phase diagram without considering the Zeeman term (hz = 0) based on the Ly = 6
system. The resulting J1-J2-Jχ model has spin SU(2) symmetry and P
i Sz
i = 0 in the ground state with no spin
polarization. As shown in Fig. S7, the 120◦N´eel phase is stabilized at small B, and CSL at large B. For even larger
B, a tetrahedral order is expected as the chiral interactions become dominant, leading to a magnetically ordered
state [26, 27]. Notice that the CSL phase has a larger regime compared to the phase diagram with the Zeeman term,
we believe that the spin Zeeman effect of the magnetic field favors the magnetically ordered state while the orbital
effect of the magnetic field promotes the CSLs.
V.
CLASSICAL PHASE DIAGRAM
To highlight the important quantum fluctuation and correlation effect, we obtain the classical phase diagram of
the same model using the classical Monte Carlo methods on the Ly × Lx = 12 × 12 system with periodic boundary
conditions on both x and y directions. We use the simulated annealing with exponentially decaying temperatures
down to 0.01 meV/kB to approximate the ground state. At each temperature we perform 8 × 105 sweeps utilizing the
SpinMC package.
As shown in Fig. S8, the classical phase diagram only has the 120◦N´eel phase stabilized at small B, and the Up-
up-down phase at large B. The chiral spin liquid is a quantum spin liquid that has no classic analog. In addition, the
stripe order can only be stabilized considering full quantum fluctuations because the CSL also emerges with the stripe
like magnetization. The classical 120◦N´eel phase contains all spins in one plane, which can be rotated freely with
the same energy. Using the spin structure factor we find prominent peaks at the K points suggesting the 120◦spin
correlations, as shown in Fig. S9. We further characterize the classical 120◦N´eel phase by the spin-spin correlations
Si · Sj = |Si||Sj|cos(θij) between neighboring bonds as shown in Fig. S10 (a). All bonds have negative correlations of
around −0.5, which corresponds to θij ≈120◦.11

FIG. S4. Magnetization for (a) the stripe phase, (b) the PP-CSL phase, (c) the UUD phase, and (d) the 120◦N´eel phase. The
blue solid circles represent positive spin values, and the red shaded circles represent negative spin values. The radius represents
the magnitude where the blue ones in (a), (c), (d) have ⟨Sz
i ⟩≈0.14, 0.41, 0.03, respectively. The larger blue circles in (b) has
⟨Sz
i ⟩≈0.01 where the radius is amplified by 10 to see the circle clearer.
On the other hand, the classical Up-up-down phase at large B has a different pattern of spin correlations as shown
in Fig. S10 (b). The correlations along the hexagon are positive indicating the “Up” spin, and the correlations between
them and the hexagonal center are negative, indicating the “Down” spin at the center. Interestingly, we find that
the two “Up” spins in the classical UUD phase has an angle around θij ≈30◦. The UUD phase can be further
confirmed by the < Sz
i > value (the magnetic field is also along z direction) as shown in Fig. S11, where the spins in
the three-sublattice component form ↑↑↓.
To characterize the phase transition between the 120◦N´eel phase and the Up-up-down phase, we obtain the energy
per site E0 and its first order derivative as a function of B. As shown in Fig. S12 (a), at am = 7.2 nm, E0 has a
sudden drop at B = 13.5, where its first order derivative shows minimum value, indicating a phase transition [see
Fig. S12 (b)]. Even though the chiral interactions cannot induce chiral spin liquid in the classical phase diagram,
it also plays an important role. Because without the chiral interactions dE0/dB decreases almost linearly over the
increase of B, which is as expected due to the Zeeman term.12

MAGNETIZATION FROM THE 120◦N´EEL PHASE TO THE UUD PHASE
The magnetization is obtained by using the middle half of the lattice to minimize the boundary effect. In order to
access more total spin sectors, we use the N = 60 × 6 lattice with finite DMRG methods. As shown in Fig. S13, the
magnetization is 0 in the limit of B = 0 T and it smoothly increases as B increases from the 120◦N´eel phase to the
UUD phase.14

CHIRAL ORDER FROM THE 120◦N´EEL PHASE TO THE CSL PHASE
The chiral order is studied on a finite N = 48×6 lattice, which is defined as < χ >= 1/(N −1)
P
{ijk}∈△/▽
Si·(Sj×Sk)
due to the open boundary. As shown in Fig. S14, the chiral order smoothly increases as B increases from the 120◦
N´eel phase to the CSL phase and it does not show a critical behavior near the phase transition point of around B = 5
T. We believe larger systems may be needed to see the critical behavior. The phase boundary between the 120◦N´eel
phase and the CSL phase is determined by the characteristic counting in the entanglement spectrum.16
