Abstract
Pyroelectric energy converter is a functional capacitor using pyroelectric material as the dielec-
tric layer. Utilizing the ﬁrst-order phase transformation of the material, the pyroelectric device can
generate adequate electricity within small temperature ﬂuctuations. However, most pyroelectric
capacitors are leaking during energy conversion. In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamics
of pyroelectric energy conversion with consideration of the electric leakage. Our thermodynamic
model is veriﬁed by experiments using three phase-transforming ferroelectric materials with diﬀer-
ent pyroelectric properties and leakage behaviors. We demonstrate that the impact of leakage for
electric generation is prominent, and sometimes may be confused with the actual power generation
by pyroelectricity. We discover an ideal material candidate, (Ba,Ca)(Ti,Zr,Ce)O3, which exhibits
large pyroelectric current and extremely low leakage current. The pyroelectric converter made of
this material generates 1.95µA/cm2 pyroelectric current density and 0.2 J/cm3 pyroelectric work
density even after 1389 thermodynamic conversion cycles.

INTRODUCTION
Energy harvesting from waste heat is an emerging research ﬁeld in sustainable energy
science [1]. The heat, particularly in low-grade regime (i. e. < 250◦C) is abundant in
nature from solar radiation and geothermal activities. Industries and human daily activi-
ties generate an immense amount of waste heat below 200◦C. Ferroelectric materials with
the temperature-dependent polarization attract increasing attention in recent years for elec-
tricity generation from 40◦C to 150◦C [2–5]. The mechanism of this energy conversion is
commonly characterized as the pyroelectric eﬀect. Many reported energy converters are
made of a capacitor with a dielectric layer whose pyroelectric property is designed for har-
vesting low-grade heat.
Most of them are thin-ﬁlm devices [4, 5] working under a bias
electric ﬁeld, provided by an external power. The electric energy generated by these devices
is usually confused with the applied bias electric ﬁeld. Without such a bias electric ﬁeld,
the performance of the energy conversion becomes rather marginal [2, 4].
When utilizing the ﬁrst-order phase transformation to pyroelectric energy conversion,
the converted electricity can be drastically magniﬁed due to the abrupt jump of polarization
caused by the structural change from ferroelectric to paraelectric phases. Without any ap-
plied bias ﬁeld, the generated pyroelectric current by a bulk phase-transforming capacitor,
i.e. 150 nA [6] is larger than the current generated by the state-of-art thin ﬁlm pyroelectric
converter, i.e. 40 nA [5] almost by a factor of four. Similar energy conversion device was
demonstrated using a single-crystal Barium Titanate [7], which generates 400 nA pyroelec-
tric current through only a 5K temperature diﬀerence covering its tetragonal (ferroelectric)
to cubic (paraelectric) phase transformation.
This has been by-far the largest reported
pyroelectric current purely converted from heat.
Removal of the bias electric ﬁeld re-deﬁnes the thermodynamic cycle for pyroelectric
energy conversion from small temperature ﬂuctuations.
Depending on the initial condi-
tion, a couple of new thermodynamic models were proposed to analyze the power output
for the power-source-free pyroelectric generators [6–8]. In our previous study for phase-
transforming pyroelectric energy conversion, the initial state of the thermodynamic system
is set as (PL, EL, TL) for temperature TL lower than transition temperature, the working
conjugate of polarization PL and electric ﬁeld EL > 0 at ferroelectric phase. The initial
polarization is achieved by an external DC voltage source.
For the bulk capacitor, the
2applied DC voltage is in the range of 30V - 50V [6, 7]. When the ferroelectric capacitor
is balanced with its charge reservoir, the external DC voltage source is removed and the
system is assumed to be electrically isolated. When the ferroelectric material undergoes a
phase transformation, the charges start ﬂowing. Therefore, this is a constant-current-output
energy conversion device. Ideally, the total charges in the isolated system preserve if the
phase-transforming dielectric layer is a perfect insulator. The charges leakage is unavoidable
and non-negligible especially at elevated temperature for the perovskite oxides [8–13]. Over
numerous energy conversion cycles, the performance of the device degrades signiﬁcantly,
which highly hinders the real applications of this new energy conversion technology. For the
thin-ﬁlm capacitors, the leakage current is a more critical problem for electricity generation
[10, 13, 14].
This paper theorizes the impact of leakage to the power-source-free energy conversion
system shown in Fig. 1(a). The charges leak inside the dielectric layer as the energy conver-
sion begins. Unlike the ideal insulation system, the electric ﬁeld of the phase-transforming
planar capacitor can not reach its initial value after each of the energy conversion cycles, as
illustrated in Fig. 1(b).

THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS
We consider the phase-transforming capacitor as the thermodynamic system. When the
system thermally ﬂuctuates about the phase-transformation temperature Tc, the charges Q
held by the capacitor accordingly fall and rise due to the alternation of capacitance caused
by the ﬁrst-order phase transformation between ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The
charge can be expressed as a function of the temperature of the phase-transforming capacitor,
T, and the voltage on the capacitor, V , i.e. Q = Q(V, T). During the cyclic thermodynamic
processes between the states (QL, VL, TL) and (QH, VH, TH) where TL < Tc < TH, all three
state variables (Q, V, T) change simultaneously without an application of a bias electric ﬁeld
[6]. Considering a planar capacitor, the voltage is proportional to the electric ﬁeld in the
capacitor. Let t = 0 mark the beginning of the ﬁrst thermodynamic cycle (cycle 1 in Fig.
1(b)), the electric ﬁeld in the capacitor is
E(0) = E0 = V0

where V0 is gained by connecting the whole electric circuit in Fig.1(a) to an external DC
source. Let t > 0 mark the energy conversion processes after the removal of external DC
source. Due to electric leakage, the stored charges Q(V, T) can not reach the initial state of
its previous thermodynamic cycle, as in Fig. 1 (b). In this case, the relative starting state
of the next cycle drifts down along the polarization curve. As a result, the thermodynamic
system is cycle-dependent. Let time tn label the starting state of the nth cycle,
E(tn+1) < E(tn) < E(tn−1) < . . . < E0.
Consequently, the stored charges in ferroelectric phase decrease after every cycle. If such a
leakage continues, there would be no charges left after a ﬁnite number of energy conversion
cycles, which ceases the electricity generation process.

Governing equations of energy conversion
At t = 0, the total charges in the system are calculated by
Qtot = CrefV0 + Q(V0, TL),
(1)
where Cref denotes the capacitance of the non-transforming capacitor, considered as the
reference capacitor in our experiment. At t > 0, the charge balance can be expressed as
Qtot −
Z t
0
Ic(ξ)dξ = Qref(t) + Q(V (t), T(t)),
(2)
where Qref is the time-dependent function of charges held by the reference capacitor for t > 0,
the function Ic represents the charge leakage current in the phase-transforming ferroelectric
capacitor, which is non-zero after energy conversion starts.
Considering the electric circuit in Fig. 1(a), we have
V (t) = Vd(t) + Qref(t)
Cref
,
(3)
where Vd is voltage on the load resistor. Substituting (3) into (2) and taking the ﬁrst order
time derivative, we get
˙Q + Cref ˙V + Ic −˙VdCref = 0.
(4)
Since Q is a function of V , the equation (4) is a ﬁrst order ODE about variables V and
Vd. The voltage on the load resistor is attributed to the generation of current −˙Q and the
leakage current Ic, as
Vd = −( ˙Q + Ic)R.
(5)
Therefore, the governing equation can be written as
RCref ¨Q + ˙Q + Cref ˙V + Ic + RCref ˙Ic = 0.
(6)
The equation (6) is a second order ODE about the variable V . We assume that the applied
voltage across the thin plate phase-transforming pyroelectric capacitor is linearly related
to the electric ﬁeld E by V = Ed where d denotes the thickness of the thin plate. The
constitutive relations for Q and Ic can be also characterized as Q(E, T) = Aq(E, T) and
Ic(E, T) = AJ(E, T) where A is the area of the planar capacitor, q(E, T) and J(E, T) are
the charge density and leakage current density. Modulated by the area A, the equation (6)
becomes
RCref ¨q + ˙q + d
ACref ˙E + J + RCref ˙J = 0.

Characterizations of ferroelectric properties
According to the constitutive relation [15], the charge density of phase-transforming py-
roelectric capacitor is a function of electric ﬁeld E and temperature T,
q = ε0E + P(E, T),
(8)
where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and the constitutive function P(E, T) is the polariza-
tion of the phase-transforming ferroelectric material. The ﬁrst and second order time deriva-
tives can be calculated directly from (8) with the partial diﬀerential quantities P,E = ∂P
∂E,
P,T = ∂P
∂T , P,EE = ∂2P
∂E2, P,TT = ∂2P
∂T 2 , and P,TE =
∂2P
∂T∂E, in which κ = P,T is an important fer-
roelectric property, deﬁned as the pyroelectric coeﬃcient. It has been widely used to judge
the performance of the pyroelectric generators [3, 5, 16, 17]. Note that, when a ﬁrst-order
phase transformation is coupled with pyroelectric property, these derivatives vary as the
temperature and electric ﬁeld.
The constitutive relations P(E, T) and J(E, T) are experimentally characterized by
the aixACCT TF ferroelectric analyzer 2000E system. Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows temper-
ature dependent ferroelectric polarization and leakage current density in the polycrystal
BaTiO3(BTO) under diﬀerent electric ﬁelds from 0kV/cm to 2kV/cm. The electric leak-
age of the material becomes more prominent at the elevated temperature under the larger
applied electric ﬁeld. In our energy conversion experiment, the working electric ﬁeld on
pyroelectric capacitor is between 0.5kV/cm and 1.2kV/cm. When the applied electric ﬁeld
is higher than 1.2kV/cm, the increasing of leakage current becomes much rapid at elevated
temperature regime. This indicates that the leakage problem is worse for the pyroelectric
thin-ﬁlm converters working under biased ﬁelds [4, 5, 17]. In the characterized temperature
regime, the polarization of the material decreases as temperature increasing with an abrupt
drop at 395K, which reveals the morphotropic phase boundary between tetragonal and cu-
bic. Evidently, Fig. 2(c) shows the singularity of the pyroelectric coeﬃcient (i. e. P,T)
at 395K. Similarly, the derivative P,E is also singular at the phase-transforming tempera-
ture. Due to such a singularity, the conventional formula of pyroelectric current [16] can
not be applied in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary when ﬁrst-order phase
transformation occurs. Instead, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation should be considered in
the thermodynamic analysis of energy conversion [6–8]. The second order derivatives P,EE
and P,TE are calculated numerically, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), which are very small
6compared to the ﬁrst derivative functions. For simplicity, we neglect these second order
derivatives in the numerical solutions of the governing equation (7). Note that we keep the
second order P,TT in all computations.

In order to benchmark materials of diﬀerent geometry under various experimental setting,
the dimensionless variables are used to represent the governing equation by the symbol with
an overhead bar, ¯·. For a speciﬁc phase-transforming pyroelectric planar capacitor with
7thickness d, the initial charging voltage V (0) = V0 associated with the electric ﬁeld E0 = V0/d
at temperature TL lower than the phase transition temperature, the nondimensional voltage,
electric ﬁeld, temperature and time are deﬁned as

(13)
where the working temperature range of the device is between TL and TH such that TL < Tc <
TH. It takes τ seconds per cycle, which fully covers the duration of phase transformation.
According to (13), the values of ¯V , ¯E, ¯T and ¯t are all between 0 and 1. Let PL = P(E0, TL)
be the initial polarization in ferroelectric phase, and JH = J(E0, TH) be the highest leakage
current density, the nondimensional polarization and leakage current density are deﬁned as

EXPERIMENT
We use three Barium Titanate based ferroelectric materials to investigate the inﬂuences
of electric leakage on pyroelectric energy conversion, and to verify our numerical model in
(17).
They are polycrystal BaTiO3(BTO), Ba(Ti, Zr0.01)O3 (BZT) and (Ba, Ca0.05)(Ti,
Zr0.01, Ce0.01)O3 (tri-doped BTO). The BTO and BZT are synthesized by the conventional
ceramic sintering method with the detailed procedure introduced in reference [6], whose
ferroelectric property was characterized in Fig. 3(a). It shows that the Zr addition increases
the polarization in ferroelectric phase. As shown in Figs. 2 (b) and 3 (b), both exhibit
similar trend of leakage as temperature increasing under diﬀerent electric ﬁelds. From energy
conversion point of view, the ﬁgure of merit of BZT is higher than that of BTO. But the
leakage of BTO is much smaller than BZT. The tri-doped BTO is synthesized by the ﬂoating-
zone method, which is commonly used for growing single crystals or textured polycrystals [18,
19]. The Cerium addition to BTO may increase the grain size and change the photorefractive
properties at high temperature [20, 21], which facilitates the growth of crystals with large
grain size. In this study, we aimed at synthesizing a new pyroelectric material with higher
energy conversion ability but lower electric leakage.
The powders of CaCO3(Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), CeO2(Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), ZrO2(Sigma
Aldrich, 99%), BaCO3(Alfa Aesar, 99.8%) and TiO2(Alfa Aesar, 99.8%) were weighed ac-
cording to the stoichiometric formulation Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.98Zr0.01Ce0.01O3, dissolved in the
ethanol and milled by zirconia balls in the planetary ball miller at 630rpm for 24hrs. The
ball-milled solution was dried and calcined at 1000◦C for 10 hours to obtain the tri-doped
Barium Titanate powder through solid state reaction. Under 30MPa hydrostatic pressure
for 30 minutes, the powder was hot-pressed into a rod-shaped green body of 6mm diameter
and 10mm length.
The green body was sintered to form the feed and seed rods in the
four-mirror Infra-red furnace (Quantum Design IRF11-001-00) by passing through the focal
point slowly with the axial speed 3mm/hr and the angular speed 3rpm. The feed and seed
rods were aligned vertically for the ﬂoating zone experiment using the same Infra-red furnace
at the growth speed 10mm/hr and relative angular speed 50rpm in air. The molten zone
was created and monitored throughout the entire growth period. Finally, the as-growth rod
was solidiﬁed and sliced along the growth direction.

RESULT
Fig. 3(a) compares the temperature-dependent polarization among BTO (red), BZT
(blue) and tri-doped BTO (green) under diﬀerent electric ﬁelds from 0kV/cm to 2kV/cm.
Within the testing temperature range, all samples undergo the ﬁrst-order phase transforma-
tion accompanying with an abrupt polarization jump, JPK from ferroelectric to paraelectric
phases. Among them, the tri-doped BTO exhibits the largest polarization (11µC/cm2) in
ferroelectric phase, making it an ideal candidate for pyroelectric energy conversion. In Fig.
3(c), the electric leakage of tri-doped BTO has been reduced magniﬁcently, which is about
1/6 of value for BTO and 1/200 of value for BZT in ferroelectric phase. Under the working
condition for energy conversion, the benchmark of leakage current density is shown in Fig.
3(d). In sharp contrast to BZT and BTO, the leaking in the new ferroelectric material is
much suppressed even in the temperature regime higher than its phase-transition tempera-
ture. In addition, we observed that the morphotropic phase boundary of tri-doped BTO gets
relatively more gradual than that of BZT, which indicates that the pyroelectric coeﬃcient at
phase transformation is moderate compared to BZT. The measured pyroelectric coeﬃcients
are 0.42µC/cm2K for BTO, 1.89µC/cm2K for BZT, and 0.87µC/cm2K for tri-dope BTO.

BZT, and (f) tri-doped BTO. The experimental results are represented in red, while the simulated
results are plotted in blue.
We used these three materials as the dielectric layer to fabricate planar capacitors with
geometries 37.44mm2 × 0.74mm for BTO, 59.44mm2 × 0.257mm for BZT, and 66.59mm2 ×
0.445mm for tri-dope BTO. Using the energy conversion electric circuit in Fig. 1(a), each of
the phase-transforming capacitors is connected to a 100kΩload resistor and a 50µF refer-
ence capacitor in series. Before energy conversion, we used an external DC voltage source
(Tektronix PS280) to charge the entire system so that both phase-transforming capacitor
and reference capacitor gain 30V voltage, and no electric charges ﬂow in the circuit. Then,
the external DC voltage source was disconnected at temperature TL < Tc.
We used our custom-made thermal stage to drive temperature of the phase-transforming
capacitor to achieve a periodic pattern around its transition temperature. For each of the
phase-transforming capacitors, we collected ﬁve consecutive thermal cycles shown in Figs.
4 (a), (c) and (e) corresponding to TL = 360K and TH = 410K. The total duration of
all thermal cycles is 142 seconds for BTO, 115 seconds for BZT, and 63 seconds for tri-
dope BTO, which are used to derive the nondimensionalized time variable. The normalized
temperature patterns for these materials are plotted as blue curves in Figs. 4 (a), (c) and
(e).
The pyrocurrent was characterized as the current passing through the load resistor, R,
calculated as
Ip = ipA,

ip = −( ˙q + J) = −

(22)
is the pyrocurrent density for an area A. It is attributed to the charge ﬂow driven by the
change of polarization and the internal leakage in the pyroelectric capacitor. As a result,
the electric ﬁeld across the pyroelectric capacitor is continuously decreasing throughout
the energy conversion process. In experiment, the measured pyrocurrent (red) is shown in
Fig. 4 (b) BTO, (d) BZT and (f) tri-doped BTO, corresponding to the numerical solutions
(blue) given by equation (17). The generation of pyrocurrent in consecutive thermal cycles
is well captured by our thermodynamic model for three samples with diﬀerent ferroelectric
properties. We conjecture that three factors play an important role in pyroelectric energy
conversion by ﬁrst-order phase transformation: 1) polarization jump before and after phase
transformation; 2) pyroelectric coeﬃcient at transition temperature; 3) leakage current den-
sity within the range of thermal ﬂuctuations applied to the sample. For the BTO sample,
all three factors are low, which indicates that it is a good insulator but a bad pyroelectric
conversion material, corresponding to a very small pyrocurrent density (66.8 nA/cm2) in all
ﬁve cycles. The BZT sample is a good energy conversion material having the largest pyro-
electric coeﬃcient among three samples, and enhanced polarization in ferroelectric phase.
But it is a bad insulator with non-negligible leakage. Considering a full loop of phase trans-
formation, its averaged pyrocurrent density of the ﬁrst cycle is 1.17µA/cm2, which degrades
to 0.34µA/cm2 after ﬁve cycles. Since the charge leakage is unidirectional, both measured
and computed pyrocurrent for BZT are biased to the negative direction with respect to
neutral point. The contribution of the leakage current to the work done on the load resistor
sometimes covers the true electric energy converted by the pyroelectric material [22–24]. For
the tri-doped BTO, both pyroelectric capability and insulation are enhanced magniﬁcently.
As a result it shows 1.95µA/cm2 pyrocurrent density without degradation at the end of ﬁfth
cycle. Note that the pyrocurrent achieved in tri-doped BTO is almost 3 times bigger than
the largest pyrocurrent reported by far in single crystal Barium Titanate with polar axis
aligned with the electric ﬁeld [7].
12V.
DISCUSSION
We use the least leaking pyroelectric capacitor (i.e. tri-doped BTO) to conduct more
cycles under diﬀerent working conditions. Fig. 5 compares the pyrocurrent given by the tri-
doped BTO capacitor in a fully discharged state and a 30V charged state. Under the same
experiment setup for energy conversion, the generated pyrocurrent strongly depends on the
initial state QL(VL, TL). A fully discharged pyroelectric capacitor with VL = 0, produces
much smaller electricity than that produced by the same capacitor with VL = 30V .
If
the pyroelectric material is leaking, the capacitor keeps discharging while converting energy
cyclically. This intrinsic discharging eventually ceases the production of electricity in the
system, even though the material itself is pyroelectrically functional.

This opens a discussion for the eﬀective life of a pyroelectric energy converter with intrin-
sic leakage. Let τ denote the duration of the half thermodynamic cycle from (PL, EL, TL) to
(PH, EH, TH) where the temperature range [TL, TH] fully covers the ﬁrst-order phase trans-
13formation from ferroelectric to paraelectric. We assumed that the cooling process from TH
is timely symmetric to the ﬁrst half thermodynamic cycle, then the electric ﬁeld at the Nth
thermodynamic cycle yields
E(2Nτ) < . . . < E(2τ) < E(0) = V0
d .
(23)
Solving the equation (17), we can calculate the electric ﬁeld E(2Nτ) for N ∈Z+. The
eﬀective life is deﬁned as the number of thermodynamic cycles N ∗, such that
E(2(N ∗+ 1)τ) < V0
2d < E(2N ∗τ).
(24)
It means that after N ∗cycles, the electric ﬁeld on pyroelectric capacitor has been reduced to
half of its initially charged value. If we only consider the current output from the pyroelectric
energy conversion, the output electric energy density on the load resistor is calculated as
W(N) = AR
d
Z 2Nτ
0
˙q2dt,
(25)
where ˙q denotes the current density passing through the load resistor R. Consider the work
done by the electrostatic force in the pyroelectric capacitor during the cyclic thermodynamic
processes, we deﬁne the pyro-work as
Wπ(N) = −
Z 2Nτ
0
E ˙Pdt.
(26)
Here the electric ﬁeld should satisfy the governing equation (17) under the driving tem-
perature proﬁle T(t). The polarization is evaluated by the experimentally characterized
constitutive relations (Fig. 2 and 3). We calculate the eﬀective life, the output work density
and the pyro-work density for BTO, BZT and tri-doped BTO capacitors, summarized in
Table I.
Without leakage, the output electric energy is supposed to be the same as the electrostatic
energy produced by the pyroelectric capacitor [6].
The loss of energy captured by our
thermodynamic model is due to the internal loss of charges over cyclic energy conversion
processes. For the most leaking capacitor BZT, its pyroelectric energy conversion ceases
at the end of the 9th cycle.
Until re-charging by an external battery, it won’t produce
electricity by pyroelectric eﬀect even the pyroelectric material is still functional. Overall,
BZT capacitor outputs 8.92 × 10−4 J/cm3 electric energy purely converted by heat. For
the BTO based capacitors, the energy conversion performance does not degrade much over
14hundreds to thousands of cycles. Particularly, the Ce, Ca, Zr doped BTO capacitor generates
0.2 J/cm3 electric energy in total of 1389 cycles, that is 3 orders of magnitudes bigger than
the energy produced by other two materials. More importantly, the collected electric energy
in external circuit almost equals to the electrostatic work done by the pyroelectric energy
conversion. With this value, the pyroelectric device can be actually useful in real energy
applications.

CONCLUSION
This paper underlies the inﬂuence of leakage on the performance of pyroelectric energy
conversion using ﬁrst-order phase-transforming ferroelectrics. Through experiments and nu-
merical simulations done for BTO, BZT and tri-dope BTO, we show that the tri-doped BTO
is most suitable for pyroelectric energy conversion for its singular polarization property and
the much reduced leakage. Our model conﬁrms that the degradation of energy conversion
performance strongly depends on the leakage current density of the pyroelectric materials.
To design a power-source-free pyroelectric energy conversion system that can continuously
harvest electricity from the waste heat, both pyroelectric property and leakage current den-
sity should be taken into account. Our work provides useful reference in future development
of high performance ferroelectric materials and the design of energy conversion systems.
