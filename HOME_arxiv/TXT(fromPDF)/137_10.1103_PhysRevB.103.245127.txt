The past years have seen rapid progress in the classiﬁcation of topological materials. These diag-
nostical methods are increasingly getting explored in the pertinent context of magnetic structures.
We report on a general class of electronic conﬁgurations within a set of anti-ferromagnetic-compatible
space groups that are necessarily topological. Interestingly, we ﬁnd a systematic correspondence
between these anti-ferromagnetic phases to necessarily nontrivial topological ferro/ferrimagnetic
counterparts that are readily obtained through physically motivated perturbations. Addressing the
exhaustive list of magnetic space groups in which this mechanism occurs, we also verify its presence
on planes in 3D systems that were deemed trivial in existing classiﬁcation schemes. This leads to
the formulation of the concept of subdimensional topologies, featuring non-triviality within part of
the system that coexists with stable Weyl points away from these planes, thereby uncovering novel
topological materials in the full 3D sense that have readily observable features in their bulk and
surface spectrum.

INTRODUCTION
With the advent of topological insulators (TIs) –
gapped quantum matter having a topological entity by
virtue of symmetry – the past years have seen a rein-
vigorated interest in band theory.
Time reversal sym-
metry (TRS) has played a major role in these develop-
ments, standing at the basis of the developments of the
ﬁrst models of the general notion of symmetry protected
states [1, 2].
More recently, the interplay with crys-
talline symmetries has provided a plethora of topologi-
cal characterizations [3–22]. In particular, it was found
that a substantial fraction of topological materials can
be diagnosed by reﬁned symmetry eigenvalue methods.
Heuristically this pertains to considering combinatorial
constraints between high symmetry momenta in the Bril-
louin zone (BZ), which can be shown to reveal classes of
band structures that actually match the full machinery
of K-theory analysis in certain cases [23], and then com-
paring them to real space atomic limits in order to deﬁne
non-triviality with respect to this reference [24, 25].
Despite the crucial role of TRS, arguably the most
paradigmatic TI model actually involves the formulation
of TRS-breaking Chern bands [26], manifesting the orig-
inal inspiration of these pursuits by Quantum Hall ef-
fects. Hence, it is of natural interest to consider the role
of magnetism in combination with the above recent de-
velopments. While the interplay of topology and mag-
netism entails a vast and established literature, ranging
from spin liquids to axion insulators [27–33], there have
been rather fruitful results on both essential symmetry

eigenvalues indicated schemes [34], that is symmetry indi-
cators [35] and, very recently, topological quantum chem-
istry [36].
Already in the non-magnetic case the reﬁned evalua-
tions resulted in new insights. In particular, the discrep-
ancies between diﬀerent approaches culminated in the
formulation of the concept of fragile topology [37]. These
are topological invariants that, unlike stable counter-
parts, characterize band-subspaces separated by energy
gaps from the other bands that can be trivialized upon
the closing of the gaps [38–41]. Of particular interest are
systems with PT or C2T symmetry that were early char-
acterized through a stable Z2 invariant [42–45], and more
recently through a fragile Z invariant [38, 46] given by the
Euler class [47–49] for which new physical eﬀects have
been predicted [50]. In fact, taking into account multiple
gap conditions [49], these phases go beyond any sym-
metry eigenvalue indicated notion and relate to the mo-
mentum space braid trajectories of non-Abelian frame-
charge characterized spectral nodes [48, 51, 52]. The role
of C2T symmetry has also been pointed out in the non-
trivial topology of the low energy bands of twisted bilayer
graphene [53, 54].
Here we revert to the question what physical impli-
cations the extension to magnetic space groups (MSG)
symmetries can bring within the above context.
To
this end we start by a case study in space group fam-
ily (SG) 75 and ﬁnd that within a magnetic background
some Wyckhoﬀpositions necessarily imply non-triviality.
Turning to anti-ferromagnetic case we, for the ﬁrst time,
ﬁnd a model exhibiting fragile and Euler class topol-
ogy in a MSG and identify the protecting symmetries
as well as deﬁning quantities. The magnetic symmetry
deﬁning anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) order is however bro-
ken upon adding a generic Zeeman term, giving rise to
a ferro/ferrimagnetic-compatible (FM) phase within the

Background magnetic structures for MSG75.5

standard notation.
The latter MSG is eﬀectively real-
ized by making the oppositely-oriented moments (red/blue
spins aligned with the ˆz-axis perpendicular to the plane)
in the former of unequal magnitude.
This thus relates
an antiferromagnetic-compatible conﬁguration of the SG75-
family with a ferro/ferrimagnetic one.
same family. The correspondence subsequently manifests
itself by conveying that the fragile topological nature has
to translate into bands of ﬁnite Chern number in the
FM counterpart. Going beyond fragile topology, we ﬁnd
that the other remaining possibility of this conﬁguration
entails a symmetry protected Weyl semi-metallic phase
phase, characterized by a quantized π-Berry phase. The
stable nodal phase corresponds to ﬁnite Z2 symmetry in-
dicator [35] that is protected by the combination of the
C4 and C2T symmetries. We moreover show that this
phase possesses a systematic correspondence to a non-
trivial Chern insulating FM counterpart at half-ﬁlling,
characterized by an even Chern number C = 2 mod 4.
We then generalize our ﬁndings by formulating an ex-
haustive list of tetragonal MSGs featuring this necessar-
ily present topological conﬁgurations and their system-
atic correspondences relating AFM and FM counterparts.
We moreover address the eﬀect of adding and remov-
ing unitary symmetries leading to the identiﬁcation of
magnetic Dirac points [55], and the generalization of the
C2T protected Weyl semi-metallic phases to numerous
MSGs. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that this mechanism
can occur on planes in 3D systems that were previously
diagnosed as trivial. At the crux of the argument lies
that the in-plane topology must coexist with symmetry
indicated nodes away from the subdimensional regions,
such that the 3D conditions appear trivial. Nonetheless,
these subdimensionally enriched topological nodal topolo-
gies exhibit robust topological features, such as corner
modes plus Fermi arcs in the subdimensional gapped
fragile AFM case [56], or Fermi arcs plus Fermi arcs in the
subdimensional Weyl nodal AFM case, and thus pinpoint
to a new class of gapped-nodal topological materials to
explore.

MAGNETIC SPACE GROUP AND
MAGNETIC STRUCTURE: A FIRST CASE
STUDY IN SG P4 (NO. 75)
To concretize matters we depart from a simple model
for the tetragonal magnetic space group PC4 (MSG No.
75.5 using the BNS convention) [57, 58]. The MSG can be
decomposed into left cosets as G75.5/G75.1 = (E|0)G75.1 +
(E|τ)′G75.1, where the space group G75.1 = C4 × T (P4,
No.
75.1 in the BNS convention) has no anti-unitary
symmetry [57] (E is the identity, the prime (·)′ stands
for time reversal, and τ = a1/2 + a2/2). MSG75.1 (P4)
has point group C4 with the normal subgroup of trans-
lations T corresponding to the primitive tetragonal Bra-
vais lattice {n1a1 + n2a2 + n3a3}n1,n2,n3∈Z where the
primitive vectors are a1 = a(1, 0, 0), a2 = a(0, 1, 0),
and a3 = c(0, 0, 1). In the following we ﬁrst focus on
the two-dimensional projection z = 0, namely we study
the corresponding magnetic layer group pc4 (denoted
MLG49.4.357 in [58]). In addition, we use the fact that
MSG75.5 (PC4) is generated by (C4z|0)T (C4z is the ro-
tation by π/2 around the z-axis in the positive trigono-
metric orientation) and (E|τ)′T (we will call (E|τ)′ a
non-symmorphic time reversal symmetry (TRS) as it
contains a fractional translation).
Generally,
magnetic
space
groups
with
non-
symmorphic
TRS,
called
Shubnikov
space
groups
of type IV [57], correspond to AFM structure. Writing
(r, m) for a magnetic moment m located at r, the
action of (E|τ)′ gives (E|τ)′(r, m) = (r + τ, −m), and
the square [(E|τ)′]2(r, m) = (r+a1 +a2, m), i.e. the mo-
ment is conserved under translation by a Bravais lattice
vector while it is ﬂipped under a fractional translation.
Hence MSG75.5 (PC4) is compatible with the AFM
structure drawn over one unit cell in Fig. 1a), where
all the moments of equal sign (pointing in the direction
of the vertical ˆz-axis) are obtained under the action of
elements generated by (C4z|0)T.
In the following, we
assume the existence of a magnetic background and
describe its eﬀect on the band structure’s topology of
itinerant electrons. We note that such magnetism can
be obtained directly as localized atomic magnetism
within density functional theory frameworks [59], or as
the solution of an eﬀective spin Hamiltonian mapped
from the Green’s functions of interacting electrons
[60, 61]. Alternatively, eﬀective electronic tight-binding
Hamiltonians were derived from the double exchange
model, i.e. non self-interacting electrons coupled through
Hund’s coupling to local classical magnetic moments
that interact via super-exchange coupling [62], where the
electron spins anti-align with the local moments, and
for which line-nodal semimetallic phases were recently
discussed [63].3

Necessary crystalline fragile antiferromagnetic
topology
Adopting maximal Wyckoﬀposition 2b [58], spanned
by the sub-lattice sites rA = a1/2 and rB = τ −rA =
a2/2, and setting one s-electronic orbital and both spin-
z-1/2 components per site, we deﬁne the corresponding
Bloch orbital basis functions
|ϕα,σ, k⟩=
X
R∈T
eik·(R+rα)|wα,σ, R + rα⟩,
(1)
with α = A, B and σ =↑, ↓(taking ˆz as the quantization
axis of the spins). Ordering the degrees of freedom as
ϕ = (ϕA,↑, ϕA,↓, ϕB,↑, ϕB,↓), the generators of MSG75.5
(PC4), i.e. C4z rotation and non-symmorphic time rever-
sal, are then represented through
⟨ϕ, Dπ/2k|(C4z|0)|ϕ, k⟩= (σx ⊗M4),
⟨ϕ, −k|(E|τ)′|ϕ, k⟩= eik·τ(σx ⊗−iσy)K,
(2)
where M4 = diag[e−iπ/4, eiπ/4], and Dπ/2 is the 3D
rotation matrix by an angle π/2 around the kz-axis,
{σi}i=x,y,z are the Pauli matrices, and K is complex con-
jugation. Combining the two generators, we also obtain
⟨ϕ, −Dπ/2k|(C4z|τ)′|ϕ, k⟩= eiDπ/2k·τ(1 ⊗−iσyM ∗

that

the
symmetries {(E|0), (C4z|0), (E|τ)′, (C4z|τ)′} on ϕA,↑is
{ϕA,↑, ϕA,↓, ϕB,↑, ϕB,↓}, i.e. all four degrees of the free-
dom are intertwined by the symmetries of MSG75.5
(PC4). It can be easily checked that this remains true
for any change of basis (i.e. under any general rotation
among the sub-lattice and spinor components). Further-
more, it can be veriﬁed that the atomic orbitals cannot be
moved to any other Wyckoﬀposition without breaking
the symmetries. We therefore conclude that {|ϕ, k⟩}k∈BZ
deﬁnes a four dimensional elementary band representa-
tion (EBR) [25, 64–66] as it is formed by the minimal set
of localized (atomic like) orbitals at the sites 2b that is
compatible with the magnetic space group symmetries,
and we denote it EBR2b
75.5.
This agrees with Ref. [36]
which lists 2b as a maximal Wyckoﬀposition and ex-
cludes this EBR from the exceptional composite EBRs.
A minimal tight-binding model for EBR2b
75.5 is given by
H(k) = t1f1(k)σz ⊗σz

It is assumed that {t1, t2, t3} are real,
while {λ1, λ2} can be complex. In the following, we ﬁrst
set t1, t2, t3 = 1, and λ1, λ2 = (1/2)eiπ/5.
Of importance for the analysis of the band structure
and its topology are the squares of the twofold anti-
unitary symmetries [67, 68]. The non-symmorphic time
reversal squares as
⟨ϕ, k|[(E|τ)′]2|ϕ, k⟩= −e−ik·2τ14×4,
(6)
from which we get
⟨ϕ, Γ|[(E|τ)′]2|ϕ, Γ⟩= ⟨ϕ, M|[(E|τ)′]2|ϕ, M⟩= −14×4.
(7)
We thus conclude that there must be a twofold Kramers
degeneracy at Γ and M, and we call them TRIM (time
reversal invariant momentum) in the following. Combin-
ing the non-symmorphic time reversal with C2z, we get
(C2z|τ)′ that is represented through
⟨ϕ, −C2zk|(C2z|τ)′|ϕ, k⟩= eiDπk·τ (σx ⊗iσx) K,
(8)
and squares as
⟨ϕ, k|[(C2z|τ)′]2|ϕ, k⟩= 14×4.
(9)
The existence of such an antiunatry symmetry that leaves
the momentum invariant and squares to +1 implies that
there exists a change of orbital basis in which the Hamil-
tonian is real symmetric [52].
This is here achieved
through eH(k) = V · H(k) · V † where V = √σx ⊗iσx.
We symbolically refer to this symmetry as the “C2T”
symmetry.
The bands are then eﬀectively analyzed using the (co-
)irreducible representations at the Γ, M and X points.
These are summarized in Table I (and discussed further
in Appendix D 1).
Whenever a band structure of an EBR may be split by
an energy gap, at least one band subspace must be topo-
logical, namely either both band subspaces are stable or
fragile topological, or one is trivial and the other must be
fragile topological [25, 37, 38]. Heuristically this is the
case because there must be an obstruction forbidding the
mapping of Bloch eigenstates of EBR subspaces to local-
ized Wannier functions (i.e. atomic limits) as a result of
the space group symmetries, since the dimensionality of
any band subspace’s Wannier basis (here two) is neces-
sarily smaller than the dimensionality of the by deﬁnition
minimal EBR (here four). As a consequence, the Wan-
nier functions representing an EBR’s subspace are either
delocalized if we impose all symmetry constraints, or are
incompatible with the space group symmetries. From the
induced irreducible co-representations (coIRREPs) and
the compatibility relations among these [23, 69, 70], we
conclude that EBR2b
75.5 can be split over all high symme-
try regions of the Brillouin zone. We actually obtain a
gapped band structure over the whole Brillouin zone in
our minimal model, see Fig. 2a) and b) that gives the4

a We note that for any maximal Wyckoﬀposition (WP) of
MSG75.1 (P4) {1a, 1b, 2c} [36, 69] the spin-z components are
good quantum numbers at Γ and M, which originates from the
fact that the vertical C4z-axes (for WPs 1a and 1b) and
C2z-axes (for WPs 2c) give natural quantization axes for the
spins. At the Wyckoﬀposition 2c (compatible with the Wyckoﬀ
position 2b of MSG75.5), the spin-z +1/2 (+3/2) induces

ordering in energy of the induced coIRREPs[71] (deﬁned
in Table I). The rational behind the splitting of the EBR
will be explained when we address the symmetry indica-
tor, which turns out to be trivial for the IRREPs ordering
of Fig. 2b). In the following we refer to the lower (higher)
two-band subspace as the valence (conduction) subspace
at half-ﬁlling.
The question is then to determine the
topology of each gapped subspace as in that case there
is no stable symmetry indicated topology.
As pointed out above, the C2T symmetry implies that
the Bloch eigenvectors can be made real through the ap-
propriate change of basis. It follows that (oriented) two-
band subspaces of such Hamiltonians are topologically
classiﬁed by Euler class χ ∈Z that can be computed
as a winding of Wilson loop [38, 47–49, 52].
We ﬁnd
that the Wilson loop (W[l], see Appendix A) of each
two-band subspace winds along both directions (i.e. inte-
grating along the base path lky = {(kx, ky)|kx ∈[0, 2π]}
and scanning through ky ∈[0, 2π], and similarly if we ex-
change kx ↔ky), see Fig. 2d). We moreover ﬁnd that the
Berry phase (eiγB[l] = DetW[l]) of both two-band sub-
spaces is π along both directions, see Fig. 2d) (red dashed
line), pointing to the non-orientability of the subspaces’
frames of Bloch eigenvectors [49]. While the Euler class
is not deﬁned strictly speaking for an unorientable band
subspace [72], we still obtain the winding of Wilson loop
as an element of π1(O(2)) = Z since W[l] ∈O(2) when
computed in the real gauge (i.e. using the Bloch eigenvec-
tors of the real symmetric form) [73]. We thus conclude
that each two-band subspace has a non-orientable non-
trivial fragile topology [49]. Moreover, we also point out
that the non-trivial π Berry-phases are actually appeal-
ing from a bulk-boundary perspective [74]. Indeed, they
culminate in-gap edge states, reﬂecting a physical signa-
ture, see [56] for a detailed analysis.
We further derive in Appendix A the necessary non-
triviality of the split EBR2b
75.5.
Following Ref. [38]
we show that the crystal symmetries impose a ﬁ-
nite fractional winding of Wilson loop over one quar-
ter of the Brillouin zone, i.e. the patch bounded by
the paths ΓXΓ′
and ΓMΓ′
(blue dashed lines) in
Fig. 2c).
This results from the diﬀerence in the sym-
metry protected quantizations of the Wilson loops over
the two base paths, i.e. Arg [eig{W[lΓXΓ′]}] = [0, π]
and Arg [eig{W[lΓMΓ′]}] = [π/2, π/2], which depends on
both the IRREPs and the spinor structure of the bands
(i.e. spin-parallel vs. spin-ﬂip parallel transports, see Ap-
pendix A), as is also veriﬁed through direct numerical
evaluation of the Wilson loop over the patch in Fig. 2e).
Then, by C4 symmetry, the Wilson loop must have a
ﬁnite integer winding over the whole Brillouin zone, as
conﬁrmed by Fig. 2d). We later refer to it as the crys-
talline Euler fragile topology (written CEF in Table III)
when we address the generalization to other MSGs.
We furthermore compute the C4-symmetric Wilson
loop ﬂow [38, 75, 76] from the point l0 = Γ to the con-
tour of the Brillouin zone l1 = ∂BS, shown in green in
Fig. 2c), and between which we extrapolate by taking the
scaled contour ν∂BZ for ν ∈[0, 1]. This also exhibits a
full winding shown in Fig. 2f). The C4-symmetric Wilson
loop winding alludes to the persistence of nontrivial frag-
ile topology after breaking (C2z|0)′ symmetry, i.e. with-
out Euler class. We refer to it as the crystalline fragile
topology (written CF in Table III).
These results thus constitute three complementary
ways to reveal the necessary non-triviality of the crys-
talline fragile topology of the split EBR2b
75.5.
B.
Stable nodal topological phases
We can characterize the symmetry indicators of a given
band structure by using the matrix containing all al-
lowed magnetic EBRs. This results in a Z2 indicator for
MSG75.5 (PC4). As detailed in Appendix D, the explicit
expression for this indicator is
z2 = nX3 mod 2,
(10)
where nX3 is the number of occupied bands at the X-point
with the IRREP X3. In agreement with the discussion
in the previous section, the indicator is trivial for the
fragile phase of EBR2b
75.5 at half-ﬁlling, as can be veriﬁed
from the coIRREPs of Fig. 2b). We emphasize that this
symmetry indicator readily generalizes for an arbitrary
even number of occupied bands, i.e. at a ﬁlling ν ∈2Z+2.
We thus conclude that a stable topological phase
can be reached through a band inversion at X. This is
achieved for the model Eq. (4) by taking |λ2| >

2|t1|.
Setting λ2 = (6/5)

Let us ﬁrst note that, similarly to Eq. (10), Eq. (11) can
also be generalized for an arbitrary even number of oc-
cupied bands (i.e. a ﬁlling ν ∈2Z + 2).
Importantly,
C2T symmetry (with [C2T]2 = +1) imposes the van-
ishing of the U(1) Berry curvature over the two-band
occupied eigen-subspaces, since within the real basis we
have F = Pf[F]iσy [52] and thus trF ≡0. As a conse-
quence, the Chern number of the gapped AFM phase at
half-ﬁlling is identically zero. From there results that the
nontriviality of the Berry phase indicates a nodal phase
(i.e. it indicates the obstruction to deﬁne a smooth pro-
jector on the occupied bands over the whole Brillouin
zone due to the presence of topologically stable band
crossings with the unoccupied bands), i.e. the necessary
existence of an odd number of nodal points inside the
domain bounded by lq. Upon the breaking of the non-
symmorphic TRS, C2zT is also broken, and the π Berry
phase indicates a C4-symmetry protected Chern number
at half-ﬁlling, or more generally at a ﬁlling ν ∈2Z + 2,
C = 2z2 mod 4.
(12)
The nontrivial Chern phases are discussed in detail in the
next section.
We emphasize that the nodal points at general mo-
menta are not indicated by the compatibility relations.
Indeed, these are stabilized by the (C2z|τ)′-symmetry
(C2T) for which there is not an eigenvalue structure.
Instead, the C2T symmetry quantizes the Berry phase
to the values {0, π}, with π indicating an odd num-
ber of nodes encircled by lq.
Embedded in 3D the
nodal points correspond to single Weyl points that are
pinned on the C2T invariant plane (i.e. at kz = 0 where
−C2zk = IC2zk = mzk = k) by virtue of the chirality-
preserving property of C2T. Indeed, any Weyl point leav-
ing the kz = 0 plane must have a mirror symmetric im-
age with equal chirality by C2T symmetry. It is therefore
forbidden for a single node to leave the plane by conser-
vation of Chern number. We refer to these phases in the
3D context as the crystalline Weyl topology (written CW
in Table III).

AFM-FM CORRESPONDENCE
We now turn to ferro/ferrimagnetic (FM) phases as-
sociated with SG75 obtained from the fragile and stable6
nodal AFM phases discussed above through the breaking
of the antiunitary symmetry (E|τ)′, thereby eﬀectively
realizing MSG75.1 (P4, Shubnikov type I). This is done
in Eq.(4) by adding a Zeeman coupling term ϵZ(1 ⊗σz).
We ﬁnd that the topology of the FM-compatible phases
are necessarily nontrivial, exhibiting Chern numbers con-
strained by crystalline symmetries that intricately relate
to the topology of the AFM counterparts.
We note that the correspondence discussed here must
be contrasted from the Chern phases obtained under an
external magnetic ﬁeld [77] which are in general not sym-
metry indicated.
A.
General mechanism
Let us ﬁrst generally address the AFM-FM corre-
spondence and its physical mechanisms.
For this pur-
pose it is worth starting from MSG83.49 (PC4/m) which
is obtained from MSG75.5 by simply adding inversion
symmetry, i.e. SG83 has point group C4h.
The pres-
ence of (I|τ)′ symmetry which squares to −1 leads to
the twofold Kramers degeneracy of the bands over the
whole Brillouin zone. The parent EBR, which we write
EBR2c
83.49, also splits with a topology characterized by
symmetry indicated mirror Chern numbers [36].
We
readily obtain the corresponding Hamiltonian by taking
λ1, λ2 = 0 in Eq. (4). The full splitting of EBR2c
83.49 re-
quires |t1|, |t2|, |t3| > 0 (which we symbolize by a single
variable ∆in Fig. 4), where t1 is a spin-z-preserving spin-
orbit coupling that acts as a delocalized Zeeman coupling
on each sub-lattice orbital but changes sign between sub-
lattice sites, and t2 and t3 are spin-preserving inter-sub-
lattice site couplings. Due to the basal mirror symme-
try ⟨ϕ, mzk|mz|ϕ, k⟩= 1 ⊗−iσz, each band-doublet can
be separated into the −i and i mirror-eigenvalue sectors,
matching with the spin-↑and spin-↓components (i.e. the
spin-z-components are good quantum numbers over the
whole Brillouin zone).
The terms in {λ1, λ2} in Eq. (4) break inversion sym-
metry and correspond to combined Dresselhaus and
Rashba spin-orbit couplings.
The eﬀect of the latter
(symbolized by λsoc) is to split the Kramers degener-
acy away from Γ and M, as represented schematically
in Fig. 4a) for z2 = 0 in Eq. (10).
The conservation
of Kramers doublets at Γ and M is due to the non-
symmorphic time reversal which still squares to −1 at
these points, as derived above.
While the bands now
have pseudo-spin components at generic momenta, the
pure spin-↑and spin-↓components are still good quan-
tum number at Γ and M since the terms in λ1,2 vanish
there.
The AFM-FM transition can then be modeled through
a Zeeman term (ϵZ) that breaks the non-symmorphic
TRS leading to the splitting of the (Γ and M) Kramers
doublets. This leads to the pure spin polarization of the
bands at Γ and M since, for any maximal Wyckoﬀposi-
tion of MSSG75.1 (P4) [36, 69], spin-↑and spin-↓induce

FIG. 4. a) Splitting and ordering of the EBR’s energy lev-
els induced by the successive breaking of inversion (I|0) and
non-symmorphic time reversal (E|τ)′ symmetries. The split
(t1, t2, t3 = ∆) four-dimensional EBR of MSG83.49 (PC4/m),
and MSG75.5 (PC4) for z2 = 0, separates into two split EBRs
of MSG75.1 (P4) under the combined eﬀect of Dresselhaus-
Rashba spin-orbit (λ1, λ2 = λsoc) and Zeeman (ϵZ) couplings,
giving rise to energy ordered pseudo-spin-polarized Chern
bands (C = sign[t2], brown). Pure spin components are drawn
in red and blue (for MSG83.49), pseudo-spin components are
drawn in magenta and green for MSG75.1. Under a strong
Zeeman splitting, the valence (conduction) subspaces become
fully pseudo-spin-polarized (see text) while conserving (at
ﬁxed λsoc) the Chern characters of the bands.

ing to a symmetry indicated nontrivial even Chern insulator

distinct sets of IRREPs at Γ and at M (see the foot-
note of Table I). In the following we thus refer to the
pseudo-spin-polarizations e↑and e↓of the bands in the
sense that the band e↑(e↓) at k has the pure spin com-
ponent ↑(↓) at Γ and M. This does not exclude the
case, for dominant spin-ﬂip terms as compared to Zee-
man splitting, of a band subspace with an opposite pure
spin conﬁguration at Γ (say spin-↑) and M (spin-↓), see
the discussion around Eq. (A6) in Appendix A. Such a
conﬁguration typically requires long-range spin-ﬂip terms
[36]. This results in energy ordered pseudo-spin-polarized
Chern bands (column ϵZ > 0 in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 12
in Appendix C) with the relative chirality of the minimal
model set by sign[t2]. Further increasing Zeeman cou-
pling (while keeping λsoc ﬁxed, see below) leads to fully
pseudo-spin-polarized valence and conduction subspaces
illustrated in the right column in Fig. 4a).
As a next step, by switching oﬀthe spin-ﬂip λ1,2-terms,
while maintaining a dominant Zeeman splitting, we adia-
batically map the fully pseudo-spin-polarized bands into
pure spin-polarized split EBRs of MSG75.1 (P4).
In-
deed, the sub-lattice sites A and B still span a single
maximal Wyckoﬀposition, now labeled 2c for MSG75.1
(P4) [69, 78], and from the absence of spin-mixing sym-7
metry we may form spin polarized EBR2c,↑
75.1, and EBR2c,↓
75.1,
from the orbital basis (ϕA,↑, ϕB,↑), and (ϕA,↓, ϕB,↓), re-
spectively. We write the adiabatic mapping of the fully
pseudo-spin-polarized valence and conduction bands into
spin-polarized split EBRs as EBR2c,e↑
75.1 ∼EBR2c,↑
75.1 and
EBR2c,e↓
75.1 ∼EBR2c,↓
75.1. The symmetry breaking term (Zee-
man) thus induces the following phase transition from
one four-dimensional split EBR (of MSG75.5) to two
two-dimensional split EBRs (of MSG75.1),
EBR2b
75.5 −→EBR2c,e↑
75.1 + EBR2c,e↓
75.1 ∼EBR2c,↑
75.1 + EBR2c,↓
75.1.
(13)
We emphasize that this mapping is model independent,
in the sense that it continues to exist when we add any
extra term in Eq. (4) that satisﬁes the symmetries of
MSG75.5 (PC4) and MSG75.1 (P4). The symmetry bro-
ken band structure is now split into four separated bands
and the question is to characterize the topology of each
single band.
The symmetry indicated Berry phase for Band n (us-
ing the bottom-up labeling of the energy eigenvalues,
i.e. En ≤En+1) along the path lq = ΓM′XMΓ (M′=M-
b2), see (in red) Fig. 2a), is [6, 13, 79] (one-band reduction
of Eq. (11), see derivation in Appendix B)

where ξ¯k
4 (n) and ξ¯k
2 (n) are the C4- and C2-eigenvalues,
respectively, at the high-symmetry point ¯k listed in Ta-
ble I. The Chern number of Band n, given through
e−i2πC(n) = (eiγ(n)
B [lq])4, is thus
C(n) = −(2/π)γ(n)
B [lq] mod 4,
(15)
see also [36].
We show below that whenever the FM
phase is obtained from one of the (necessarily) nontrivial
AFM phases of EBR2b
75.5, it must be made of nontrivial
Chern bands. Remarkably, the Zeeman splitting of the
stable nodal phase of MSG75.5 (PC4), i.e. with z2 = 1 in
Eq. (10), necessarily generates a nontrivial Chern FM
phases at half-ﬁlling, with C = 2 mod 4 according to
Eq. (12), see Fig. 4b). This is discussed in detail below
where we show that Eq. (12) matches with Eq. (14,15)
for Band 1 and 2. Below we also use the pseudo-spin po-
larization to predict single bands of higher Chern number
(i.e. C = ±3 mod 4) in some regime. In the following we
refer to these symmetry indicated Chern phases as the
crystalline Chern topology (we call it CC topology in the
following).
Before we study the AFM to FM phases correspon-
dence for the model Eq. (4) in more detail, we impor-
tantly note that the same nontrivial AFM phases, as well
as the AFM to FM correspondence, can be obtained from
the following EBRs (for MSG75.5 (PC4) →MSG75.1
(P4)):

plane spinors {(→), C4z(→), C2z(→), C−1

a quantization axis that is perpendicular to the vertical
C4-axis [80] (we chose ˆy in Table III with →y).
B.
Small Zeeman splitting
Here we derive the topology of the FM phases obtained
from each of the nontrivial AFM phases of EBR2b
75.5 when
the Zeeman splitting is small compared to the other en-
ergy scales (i.e. ϵZ < ∆, λSOC in Fig. 4), underpinning
the general mechanism outlined previously.
1.
Crystalline Chern ferro/ferrimagnetic topology from
fragile AFM phase
Starting from the gapped fragile phase of EBR2b
75.5
(z2 = 0) and given the sign of the Zeeman coupling
(ϵZ > 0, i.e. E↑z > E↓z) we predict the ordering in
energy of the IRREPs of each split Kramers degener-
acy to be E(Γ7) < E(Γ5) < E(Γ8) < E(Γ6), and
E(M5) < E(M8) < E(M6) < E(M7). We show the band
structure for MSG75.1 in Fig. 5a) and b) together with
the IRREPs along high-symmetry lines thus conﬁrming
the IRREPs ordering.
Substituting the symmetry eigenvalues in Eq. (14) we
then readily ﬁnd C(1) = C(4) = +1 mod 4, and C(2) =
C(3) = −1 mod 4. We conclude that each split EBR2c
75.1
has a stable Chern class topology. This is conﬁrmed by
direct evaluation of the ﬂow of Berry phase for each band,
see Fig. 12 in Appendix C.
2.
Crystalline Chern FM from stable nodal AFM phase
We now start from the stable nodal phase of EBR2b
75.5
(z2 = 1).
The breaking of non-symmorphic TRS un-
locks the nodal (Weyl) points which then become free
to leave the basal momentum plane (when embedded in
3D). As for the fragile topological phase this results in a
fully gapped band structure at kz = 0 where each band8
acquires a symmetry indicated Chern number given by
Eq. (14). Given the band inversion at X between Band 2
and 3 required in the fragile to stable topological transi-
tion (see the IRREPs ordering in Fig. 3b)), we now ﬁnd
band Chern numbers
C(1) = C(2) = C(3) = C(4) = +1 mod 4.
(17)
Then,
together
with
the
cancellation
sum
rule
P4
i=1 C(i) = 0, we predict C(2) = −3 and C(3) = +1
(or, equivalently, C(2) = +1 and C(3) = −3).
This
is conﬁrmed numerically in Fig. 13 of Appendix C. We
thus reach the conclusion that for small Zeeman cou-
pling the bands in the vicinity of the half-ﬁlling energy
must exhibit a higher Chern number. Also, contrary to
the gapped FM phase obtained from the fragile topolog-
ical phase where the valence (conduction) subspace has
a trivial summed topology (i.e. C(1) + C(2) = 0), we here
necessarily obtain a nontrivial Chern phase at half-ﬁlling
with C(1) + C(2) = ±2, thus recovering the general pre-
diction of Eq. (12).
C.
Fully pseudo-spin-polarized FM phases
Given the spin-z components associated with the in-
duced IRREPs of the EBR at Γ and M (Table I), we
anticipate that by increasing ϵZ there must be a second
transition into a phase with fully pseudo-spin-polarized
valence (conduction) bands (right column of Fig. 4), i.e.
the e↑-(e↓-)band has a ↑-(↓-)spin component at Γ and M.
This phase transition must happen through two band
inversions, i.e. at Γ and at M. Assuming ϵZ > 0, we in-
fer that beyond the transition the IRREPs ordering at
Γ and M are E(Γ7) < E(Γ8) < E(Γ5) < E(Γ6), and
E(M5) < E(M6) < E(M8) < E(M7), respectively (im-
portantly, note the diﬀerence with the ordering of the
previous section and Fig. 5b)). The question of the Chern
numbers, as determined by Eq. (14), is then reduced to
the IRREPs ordering at X.
First, without loss of generality we can assume that
the lowest (highest) energy level has IRREP X4 (X3),
as in Fig. 2b) and Fig. 3b), from which we get C(1) =
C(4) = +1 mod 4. Then, for dominant values of ϵZ and
λSOC , we get C(2) = C(3) = −1 mod 4. If we assume
intermediary values of ϵZ and λSOC (see below), we in-
stead obtain C(2) = C(3) = +1 mod 4. In the later case,
(similarly to the discussion below Eq. (17)) one of the
two middle bands must exhibit a high Chern number of
−3, giving a total Chern number of ±2 at half-ﬁlling for
the valence/conduction space.
We now detail the phase transition to the fully polar-
ized phase in the context of the model Eq. (4) to underpin
the general scheme outlined above.
The fully pseudo-
spin-polarized phase must happen through two band in-
versions, at Γ and M, which are analytically deﬁned for
Eq. (4) by the conditions ϵZ > 2t3 and ϵZ > 2t2, respec-
tively (assuming t2,3 > 0), and with the IRREPs ordering
at Γ and M given above for ϵZ > 0. The general form of
the energy eigenvalues at X for Eq. (4) including the Zee-
man term is ϵs1,s2 = s12t1 + s2
p
2|λ2|2 + ϵ2
Z with s1,2 =
±1, and we ﬁnd E±(X4) = ϵ−,± and E±(X3) = ϵ+,±.
Fixing t1 > 0, we note that E−(X4) ≤E+(X4) ≤E+(X3)
and E−(X4) ≤E−(X3) ≤E+(X3).
Hence, the low-
est and highest energy levels are E1 = E−(X4) and
E4 = E+(X3), respectively, from which we get C(1) =
C(4) = 1 mod 4.
The topology of the two remaining bands is then de-
termined by the sign of
E−(X3) −E+(X4) = 2t1 −
q
2|λ2|2 + ϵ2
Z.
(18)
Let us ﬁrst we assume |λ2| >
√
2t1, for which we ﬁnd
E2 = E−(X3) < E+(X4) = E3 for all ϵZ > 2t2, 2t3, and
C(2) = C(3) = −1 mod 4. This case thus has zero Chern
number at half-ﬁlling.
If we take instead t1 > |λ2|/
√
2, then either ϵZ >
p
4t2
1 −2|λ2|2, 2t2, 2t3, and we reach the same conclu-
sion as before, or
p
4t2
1 −2|λ2|2 > ϵZ > 2t2, 2t3, in
which case E2 = E+(X4) < E−(X3) = E3, and we ﬁnd
C(2) = C(3) = +1 mod 4 which, we have shown, leads to
a higher Chern number for Band 2 or 3, thus leading to
a ﬁnite Chern number at half-ﬁlling (C = 2 mod 4).
We conclude this section by noting that the bands of a
single split EBR2c,↑(↓)
75.1
must always carry non-zero Chern
numbers irrespectively of the ordering of IRREPs.
IV.
3D TOPOLOGY AND GENERAL MSG
Having determined the topology of the 2D projection
of MSG75.5 (PC4) (i.e. for the corresponding magnetic
layer group), we now address the 3D topology introduc-
ing the third momentum component kz. First of all, we
note that each Kramers doublet at Γ, M, Z, and A, are
Weyl points carrying a chirality (Chern number). This
results from the chirality of any crystal structure with
MSG75.5 (PC4), see Section VI. This nodal topology will
be manifested in terms of Fermi arcs on surface spec-
tra only at quarter-ﬁlling, and more generally at a ﬁlling
ν ∈2Z + 1.
In the following we instead focus on the
topology at half-ﬁlling, and more generally at a ﬁlling
ν ∈2Z + 2.
The above results are directly transferable to the kz =
0 and kz = π planes of the 3D Brillouin zone, which leads
to a (z0
2, zπ
2 ) ∈Z2
2 classiﬁcation. If the two symmetry
indicators are distinct, e.g. (z0
2, zπ
2 ) = (1, 0), they indicate
the presence of C2z protected Weyl points (at half-ﬁlling)
on the XR high-symmetry axis, on top of the four Weyl
points on the kz = 0-plane, while the plane at kz = π has
CEF topology. These thus form a Z2 indicated octuplet
of Weyl points (i.e. the CW topology). It is interesting
to note that by C4 symmetry the Weyl points in plane
must all have the same chirality, while the Weyl points on
the XR axis must all be of the opposite chirality by C2T
symmetry, which leads to the conﬁguration of Fig. 6a)9

where the plane with CEF topology is colored in green.
If we reverse the indicators, i.e. (z0
2, zπ
2 ) = (0, 1), the
plane with CEF topology moves to kz = 0 and the plane
with the Weyl nodes moves to kz = π.
When both symmetry indicators are nonzero (obtained
from above through a band inversion at R) both planes
are stable nodal and we either obtain two quadruplets of
Weyl points of opposite chirality in each horizontal plane
as illustrated in Fig. 6b) (after the annihilation on the
vertical axes of the nodes with opposite chirality visible
in Fig. 6c)), or we have two octuplets of Weyl points with
all Weyl points on the horizontal planes with the same
chirality and all Weyl points on the vertical axes with the
opposite chirality as shown in Fig. 6d).
Only when both symmetry indicators are zero do we
retrieve a gapped 3D phase where both planes kz = 0
and kz = π are fragile topological.
Our classiﬁcation
thus characterizes and reﬁnes the earlier prediction of
a Z2 symmetry indicator for the 3D MSG75.5 (PC4)
phases [35]. As a side remark, we note that planes host-
ing the four TRIM {Γ, M, Z, A} characterized by (non-
symmorphic) TRS, i.e.
is an anti-unitary symmetry
squaring to −1 and inverting the momentum, give rise
to a non-symmetry indicated Z2 index of a strong two-
dimensional TI [32]. We note that the non-symmorphic
TRS squares to −1 over the whole plane that contains
the four TRIMPs. Therefore, restricting any 3D model
on that plane, it can be seen eﬀectively as a 2D system
with TRS and the index can be computed in the same
way as the Kane-Mele Z2 invariant [81].
For completeness, let us also mention the axion insulat-
ing phases protected by C2T, i.e. the three-dimensional
gapped topological phases indicated by the diﬀerence in
the second Stiefel Whitney class between the two C2T
symmetric planes kz = 0, π [29, 30, 42, 82]. This phase
requires that C2T squares to +1 on both planes and, con-
trary to its parent phases with inversion symmetry [36],
it is not symmetry indicated.
The mechanism discussed so far is directly transferable
to the other tetragonal AFM candidate MSG81.37 (PC¯4)
and its FM counterpart MSG81.33 (P¯4), where the four-
fold rotoinversion point symmetry S4 takes the place of
C4. The only diﬀerences with MSG75.5 (PC4) are the
reversal of chirality of the Weyl points under the action
of S4 = IC4z symmetry and, for the 3D gapped phase,
the existence of an additional z′
2 ∈Z2 symmetry indi-
cator [35] of a strong 3D TI protected by S4-symmetry
and (non-symmorphic) TRS [83] (see also Appendix D 3
where this symmetry indicator is derived for MSG81.36
(Pc¯4) for which it is the unique symmetry indicator of
the 3D gapped phase, similarly to MSG81.38 (PI¯4)). The
nontrivial value of the symmetry indicator z′
2 in Eq. (D4),
corresponding to the indicator z2 identiﬁed for MSG81.33
(P¯4) in Ref. [36], indicates a 3D axion topological insu-
lating phase with a non-trivial axion angle π [36] and a
quantized magnetoelectric response [28, 84].
We conclude this section by noting the candidate
MSSG77.17 (PC42) that has a Z2 symmetry indicator
[35] which indicates C2T protected Weyl semi-metallic
phases, as in MSG75.5 (PC4), but now with a mini-
mal connectivity of bands of 4, i.e. the ﬁlling must be
ν ∈4Z + 4.
The 2D gapped phases at kz = 0, π are
thus either trivial, or host the second Stiefel Whitney
topology that is not symmetry indicated, since the non-
trivial Euler class topology only exists within two-band
subspaces.
V.
COEXISTENCE OF NODAL AND
SUBDIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGIES
In the previous MSG candidates we were guided by
the possibility of having a non-trivial symmetry indi-
cator of the 3D gapped phase, signaling the possibility
of splitting groups of bands (possibly EBRs) into (frag-
ile) topological bands, see also Appendix D. We now ad-
dress a class of MSGs that host a similar mechanism that
nonetheless appear trivial from a standard symmetry in-
dicator or topological quantum chemistry perspective.
At the crux of the argument lies the observation that
these MSGs host groups of bands (possibly EBRs) that10
can be split at planes in the Brillouin zone, hosting the
same (stable) topological features, while their total three-
dimensional band structure must be connected. Conse-
quently, within these “trivial” groups of bands, i.e. in the
sense that they lack 3D symmetry indicators, the in-plane
non-trivial signatures must coexist with symmetry indi-
cated nodal structures located away from the (possibly)
gapped planes. We discuss below one example where the
connectivity of the three-dimensional EBR by itself indi-
cates the presence of protected Weyl points in the direc-
tion perpendicular to the 2D topological planes. It thus
has stable 3D signatures, such as Fermi arcs [85], which
topological origin is independent of the 2D topologies and
their signatures. Since the 3D symmetry indicators are
blind to this kind of coexistence, these topological phases
can thus only be perceived in this reﬁned context of sub-
dimensional topology.
We emphasize that our use of subdimensional topology
is distinct from the usual correspondence between the
topological charges of a d-dimensional node, with codi-
mension δ within a d+δ=D-dimensional Brillouin zone,
and the p-dimensional gapped topologies for δ −1 ≤p ≤
D −1 [46, 86].
The archetypal example of this usual
decent approach is the stability of a Weyl point being
captured by the Chern number of a gapped sphere sur-
rounding it [87]. We discuss below such as a situation
for the case of Weyl nodes protected by the screw axis 42
with a chirality χ = ±2 captured by gapped Chern planes
with C = 2 mod 4. Many correspondences of this kind
have been formulated recently for new types of crystal-
symmetry protected gapped topologies, e.g. [86, 88–90].
In contrast, the new sub-dimensional topology we are
referring to is independent of the charges of the Weyl
nodes protected by the screw symmetry, since we show
that the Chern number must be zero on the 2D planes
that host the sub-dimensional topology.
This leads to
the prediction of new phases with coexisting topological
features, i.e. the manifestations of the nodal topology
in 3D together with the manifestations of the nontrivial
sub-dimensional topology.
A.
Case study of MSG77.18 (PI42)
As an example, we take MSG77.18 (PI42) that hosts
the mechanism discussed for MSG75.5 (PC4) as a 2D sub-
dimensional topology.
The coset decomposition of the
AFM compatible MSG77.18 (PI42) in terms of its FM
partner MSG77.13 (P42) is G77.18/G77.13 = (E|0)G77.13 +
(E|τd)′G77.13 with τd = a1/2 + a2/2 + a3/2, where T is
the primitive Bravais lattice and G77.13 is generated by
(C4z|τ3)T with τ3 = a3/2. We consider the Wyckoﬀpo-
sition (WP) 2a [69] that is spanned by the sub-lattice
sites rA = a1/2 and rB = a2/2 + a3/2.
The same
sites correspond to WP 2c of MSG77.13.
Populating
the sites with s-electronic orbitals and both spin-z-1/2
components we get the Bloch orbital basis |ϕ, k⟩with
ϕ = (ϕA↑, ϕA↓, ϕB↑, ϕB↓) forming an elementary band
representation which we write EBR2a

the 3D Brillouin zone.
An other important diﬀerence with MSG75.5 (PC4) is
the algebra of symmetries at kz = π. Taking a point on
the kz = π plane ¯k = (kx, ky, π), the C2T symmetry in
MSG77.18 (PI42) is represented for EBR2a
77.18 by
⟨ϕ, ¯k|(C2z|τd)′|ϕ, ¯k⟩= eikC2zτd⟨ϕ, ¯k|ϕ, IC2z¯k⟩(σx ⊗iσx)K
= eikC2zτd⟨ϕ, ¯k|ϕ, ¯k −b3⟩(σx ⊗iσx)K
= eikC2zτd ˆT(−b3)(σx ⊗iσx)K,
(19)
with ˆT(−b3) = diag(eirA·K, eirA·K, eirB·K, eirB·K)K=−b3
= diag(1, 1, −1, −1).
We thus ﬁnd the square to be
⟨ϕ, ¯k|[(C2z|τd)′]2|ϕ, ¯k⟩= −14×4, i.e. the C2T symmetry
squares to −1.
The bands hence exhibit a twofold
Kramers degeneracy over the whole kz = π-plane

obtained by breaking TRS through a Zeeman coupling. The
Weyl nodes imposed at half-ﬁlling by the screw axis 42
are marked with colored circles indicating the sign of the
symmetry-imposed chiralities.
We show the band structure of model Eq. (20) in
Fig. 7a) where the kz-axis covers [0, 2π], and the other
axis corresponds to the successive paths ΓX and XM
within the plane kz = 0. The band structure along the
high-symmetry lines is shown in Fig. 8a), and c) after
a band inversion at X. We note the twofold degeneracy
at kz = π which explains the degeneracies along ZR and
RA in Fig. 7a), and in Fig. 8a) and c).
Importantly, the compatibility relations along the C4-
symmetric axes ΓZ and MA imply that the EBR cannot
be split [69], see Appendix D 2. Indeed, the fourfold screw
symmetry 42 ≡(C4z|τ3) imposes an exchange of branches
between the Kramers doublets of Γ and Z (M and A),
see the coIRREPs given in Table II retrieved from [69].
This leads to two 42-protected nodal points on the ΓZ-
line (resp. the MA-line) at half-ﬁlling (marked by circles
in Fig. 7a)), and more generally at a ﬁlling ν ∈4Z +
2. We note that this exchange of IRREPs along the 42-
axes originates from the monodromy of the irreducible
representations of the screw symmetry 42 [6, 69, 86, 91,
92].
2.
Chirality of Weyl nodes protected by a screw axis 42
Following the algebraic argument of Ref. [6], see also
Ref. [86], we now derive the symmetry enforced chirality
of χ = 2mod4 for each Weyl point protected by 42. Let us
start with a sphere S surrounding one of the Weyl points,
say the one on the upper half of the ΓZ line. We ﬁx the
south pole at Γ and the north pole at Z, see Fig. 9a).
Then, we divide the sphere in four quarters, one of which,
let us call it S, is bounded by an oriented loop ∂S ≡l =
lb ◦la (which we read as ﬁrst la followed by lb) with

(g|τg)(kikj) for
a coIRREP kikj at a momentum k, and χ4(ki) is the
character of the IRREP ki given in Table I (we have
χ4(Zi) = χ4(Γi) [69]).
Therefore, γB[l] = π mod 2π
and we conclude that the Chern number over the whole
sphere, and thus the chirality of the Weyl point inside, is
C[S] = 2 mod 4. Very interestingly, we ﬁnd a quadratic
dispersion in the (kx, ky)-plane at a ﬁxed kz from each
Weyl point at half-ﬁlling in Fig. 7, see also [92].
While the above derivation based on the symmetry re-
duction of Wilson loop, ﬁrst developed in Ref. [6, 86]
adapting the Wilson loop techniques developed eariler
to assess gapped topological phases in [13, 79, 93–95], is
completely general and can be readily transferred to any
other context (i.e. any other space group, with or with-
out spin-orbit coupling), we note some later alternative
approaches in Ref. [92, 96].
3.
AFM topological phases
We now discuss the global topology of the AFM topo-
logical phases for MSG77.18 (PI42). We ﬁrst note that
EBR2a
77.18 can be gapped over the planes kz = 0, π. The
2D topology at kz = 0 for EBR2a
77.18 is the same as the
topology discussed for EBR2b
75.5, that is CEF topology
versus stable nodal (CW topology) indicated by z2 in
Eq. (10).
We therefore can deﬁne a sub-dimensional
z0
2 ∈Z2 symmetry indicator. We have seen that on the
kz = π plane the C2T symmetry squares to −1, such
that there is no (real) Euler class topology. Neverthe-
less, we show in Fig. 10 the C4-symmetric Wilson loop
on the plane kz = π for the model for MSG77.18 (PI42)
Eq. (20), over a) the conduction and b) valence bands.
The winding of Wilson loop for the conduction bands
indicates a crystalline (non-Euler) fragile (CF) topology.
FIG. 10. C4-symmetry Wilson loop for the conduction a) and
valence b) bands of EBR2a
77.18 at kz = π.
We now determine how the subdimensional topolo-
gies (at kz = 0, π) interact with the topology of the 42-
symmetry protected Weyl points. We ﬁrst note that the
Chern number at half-ﬁlling vanishes on the kz = 0, π-
planes as a consequence of C2T symmetry (see the dis-
cussion below Eq. (11) for kz = 0, and at kz = π,
we have F ≡0 by [C2T]2 = −1).
As a consequence,
we can deform the sphere S of Fig. 11a) into the pyra-
mid P of Fig. 11b) while conserving the Chern number,
i.e. C[S] = C[P] = 2 mod 4. This equality can be readily
veriﬁed through the symmetry reduction of the Wilson
loop W[ld ◦lc ◦lb ◦la] similarly to the above derivation for
S but now using both C4z and C2z transformations [6].
We note that even if there are nodal points on the kz = 0
plane (for z2 = 1), by C4 symmetry they must contribute
to an increase of the Chern number by ±4, which leaves
the quantity mod4 unchanged. An other consequence of
C2T symmetry is that any Weyl point above the kz = 0
plane must have its mirror symmetric image underneath
(kz →IC2zkz = −kz) with the same chiral charge. Com-
bining the top of the pyramid in Fig. 9b) with its mir-
ror image in the kz-direction, we obtain an octahedron
O = P ∪mzP that wraps the pair of Weyl points on the
ΓZ line, and over which there is a total Chern number
(chirality) of C[O] = (2 + 2) mod 8 = 4 mod 8.
We note that O divides the 3D Brillouin zone in two
symmetric halves. Invoking the Nielsen-Ninomiya can-
cellation theorem [97], it follows that the total chirality
inside O (say +4), must be compensated by the total chi-
rality inside the complement of O (−4), see Fig. 9. We
then arrive for z2 = 0 to the conﬁguration of Fig. 11a),
where the green (purple) plane hosts a CEF (CF) topol-
ogy, and where each red (blue) point mark a Weyl point
with χ = +2 (rep. χ = −2). We ﬁnally conclude that
this phase must exhibit large double Fermi arcs in the
surface spectra connecting pairs of projected Weyl nodes
of opposite chirality across the surface Brillouin zone.
Also, by inverting IRREPs at X, i.e. setting z0

get the octuplet of Weyl points discussed above in the 3D
phase of MSG75.5 (PC4), leading to the conﬁguration of
Fig. 11b). This last case must exhibit an exotic coexis-
tence of Fermi arcs generated by diﬀerent sets of Weyl
points with qualitatively distinct topological origins.
Our sub-dimensional analysis has thus allowed us to
identify new phases with the coexistence of 2D and 3D
nodal topological features.
4.
AFM-FM correspondence
We now consider the eﬀect of breaking the non-
symmorphic TRS, i.e. inducing a transition from the
AFM phase of MSG77.18 (PI42) to the FM phase of
MSG77.13 (P42). This can be done by including a Zee-
man splitting as we did for MSG75. We show the band
structure in Fig. 7b), and along the high-symmetry lines
in Fig. 8b), and d) after a band inversion at X. We
ﬁnd that all the Kramers degeneracies are split leav-
ing gapped bands on the kz = 0 and π planes. Simi-
larly to the case of MSG75.1 (P4), the topology of the
gapped bands at ﬁxed kz are characterized through sym-
metry indicated Chern numbers (i.e. with CC topology).
Interestingly, for moderate Zeeman coupling, the four
bands remain fully connected along the C4-symmetric
axes through the persistence of the C4-symmetry pro-
tected Weyl nodes, as indicated by the IRREP order at
Γ, Z, M, and A, as it is clearly shown in Fig. 8b) and d).
We note however that, by relaxing the pairing condi-
tions (i.e. from 2D coIRREPs to 1D IRREPs), there are
more combinatorial ways of connecting the bands allowed
by the compatibility relations for MSG77.13 (P42). In
particular, the bands can be ordered at {Γ, Z, M, A} as
to avoid Weyl points at half-ﬁlling (more generally at a
ﬁlling ν ∈4Z + 2).
5.
Stable 3D signatures
We emphasize that the rational of sub-dimensional
topologies thus works in two manners. Firstly, because
the total 3D EBR is connected, and thus trivial, these
phases are missed by previous schemes. Reciprocally, the
presence of in plane topology together with the nodes to
make the EBR globally connected implies the coexistence
of topological signatures of qualitatively distinct origins.
On one hand, the connectivity condition directly induces
symmetry indicated Weyl points, and in turn, Fermi arcs
in the surface spectra. On the other hand, the subdimen-
sional topology is either gapless, in which case it induces
additional Weyl points and thus additional Fermi arcs, or
it is gapped fragile topological, in which case it induces
corner modes [56]. In this sense this mechanism can thus
be used to ﬁnd new topological signatures that are di-
rectly detectable via the usual routes of e.g. angle re-
solved photoemission spectroscopy, quantum oscillation
techniques or scanning tunneling microscopy.
B.
Generalization
We end by generalizing our sub-dimensional topology
scheme and search systematically for candidate MSGs
hosting the planar topologies discussed so far−that is,
CEF, CF, and CW phases for the AFM cases and CC
phases for their FM counterpart−and the outlined mech-
anisms relating them.
Remarkably, our results are di-
rectly transferable to all tetragonal MSGs with the point
groups C4 and S4, i.e. comprising space group families
SG75-SG82.
For each family we then consider all the
Shubnikov type IV AFM MSGs and the one type I FM
MSG. This amounts to a total of 26 MSGs which we list
in Table III, where we give the type of planar topologies
for kz = 0 and kz = π, and the list of EBRs hosting
these.
On top of the single EBRs that split on both
planes, kz = 0 and kz = π, and which must necessar-
ily host a nontrivial planar topology of type indicated,
we have also listed the sums of EBRs that can lead to a
listed topology upon the permutation of their IRREPs.
Whenever there is the choice CEF/CW, the topology is
determined by the ordering of IRREPs. We note that
[C2T]2 = ±1 indicates CEF or CEF/CW (+1) versus
CF (−1) topology [98][99] as the only alternative since
the Chern number must vanish.
Finally, all FM can-
didates acquire CC topology when obtained from their
AFM parents through Zeeman splitting. In particular,
every nodal AFM phase at half-ﬁlling must give rise to
a nontrivial Chern FM phase at half-ﬁlling, thus consti-
tuting a systematic correspondence between necessarily14
TABLE III.
Candidate MSGs for the (Euler) fragile/stable-nodal AFM to Chern FM mechanism, including those proﬁting
from the subdimensional topological analysis. The table lists the AFM and corresponding FM counterparts as well as their
time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) which host Kramers doublets (i.e. Weyl nodes). Moreover, it details the topology by
enumerating the value of C2T = ±1 and the two-band subspace (2-BS) characterization on the kz = 0, π momentum planes.
[C2T]2 = +1 indicates Euler class (real) topology, while [C2T]2 = −1 implies the twofold Kramers degeneracy of the bands. The
labels CEF, CF, CW, and CC indicate crystalline Euler fragile (with symmetry-indicated Wilson loop quantization), crystalline
fragile (with the winding of C4-symmetric Wilson loop), and crystalline Weyl semimetallic (with a symmetry-indicated π-Berry
phase), respectively. When the 2-BS Topology is CW, we mean that there must be Weyl nodes connecting adjacent two-band
subspaces. When we write CEF/CW, we mean that either of the topologies is realized depending on the ordering of IRREPs.
Finally, the EBR column speciﬁes the elementary band representationsa hosting the topologyb. All FM candidates acquire
crystalline Chern (CC) topology when obtained from their AFM parents through Zeeman splitting.

CHIRAL FERMIONS AT
HIGH-SYMMETRY MOMENTA AND LARGE
FERMI ARCS
All the MSGs of the table with point group C4 (i.e. the
type IV AFM MSG75.4-MSG81.36, and the type I FM15
MSG75.1-MSG80.29) have only proper symmetries, a
consequence of which is that any crystal structure that
explicitly breaks all symmetries not included in their
MSG must be chiral, i.e. enantiomorphic (the SGs 75-76-
77-78-79-80 are all among the 65 Sohncke space groups
with no inversion, no mirror, nor roto-inversion symme-
tries [100]).
Then, the absence of improper symmetry
allows the existence of Weyl nodes at high-symmetry
momenta, i.e. with non-vanishing Chern numbers. This
is the rationale for the chiral Fermions found in many
(non-magnetic) material candidates with a Sohncke space
group [6, 101–105].
We have noted that MSG75.5 (PC4) and MSG77.18
(PI42) exhibit Weyl nodes at every TRIMP at a ﬁlling
2Z + 1. MSG77.18 must also exhibit Weyl nodes on the
ΓZ- and MA-lines at a ﬁlling 4Z + 2 due to the mon-
odromy of the irreducible representation of the screw axis
42. The same results apply to the FM parents MSG75.1
(P4) and MSG77.13 (P42). The Weyl points at high-
symmetry momenta for all the other MSGs of the table
can be found similarly.
In Ref. [6] we have given a detailed analysis of the
symmetry indicated higher Chern number generated by
the Weyl points locked on a screw axis at half-ﬁlling, and
derived the necessary existence of large Fermi arcs due to
the compensation of chirality across the Brillouin zone.
This analysis can be readily transferred to the present
situation (e.g. here C = ±2 on the 42-axes). Large Fermi
arcs has also been reported in other non-magnetic chiral
materials [102, 103].
In the next section, we discuss the fate of the Weyl
points when extra improper point symmetries are in-
cluded.
We now turn to the MSGs with roto-inversion symme-
try IC4z. Since the chirality of Weyl points is reversed
under IC4z, the Kramer’s degeneracies at the TRIMPs
(which are also IC4z invariant momenta) cannot form
Weyl nodes at the ﬁlling 2Z + 1. Instead, each double
degeneracy at a TRIMP on the kz = 0 plane is continued
as a nodal line for all values of kz [69].
VII.
RAISING AND LOWERING OF
SYMMETRIES
So far, we have focused on the topological correspon-
dence between representations of magnetic space groups
with the tetragonal point groups C4 and S4. We now
brieﬂy address the eﬀect of adding and removing unitary
symmetries.
A.
Magnetic Dirac Fermions
Let us start by including extra unitary symmetries to
MSSG75.5 (PC4). If we include one extra vertical mirror
symmetry, say my, the MSG is promoted to MSG99.169
(PC4mm) with the (unitary) point group C4v (4mm).
Remarkably the four bands become all connected through
a fourfold magnetic Dirac node at M, similarly to the
examples discussed in Ref. [55].
The same happens for MSG89.93 (PC422), obtained
by including one horizontal π-rotation symmetry (say
C2y) leading to the point group D4 (422), as well as
for MSG83.49 (PC4/m), obtained by including the basal
mirror symmetry mz leading to the point group C4h
(4/m).
The
structural
chirality
is
lost
for
MSG99.169
(PC4mm) and MSG83.49 (PC4/m), thus preventing
the existence of Weyl nodes at the TRIMPs, i.e. the
Weyl points are absorbed within vertical nodal lines on
the C4z-axes, and, respectively, within a global twofold
Kramer’s degeneracy. For MSG89.93 (PC422) instead,
the structural chirality, and thus the Weyl nodes, are
preserved.
We note that the introduction mz allows the deﬁni-
tion of C4-symmetry indicated mirror Chern numbers
[13, 83, 106]. The systematic study of the magnetic topo-
logical phases for the next magnetic super-space groups,
however, lies beyond the scope of the present work.
B.
Weyl phases protected by [C2T]2 = +1
The symmetry indicator Eq. (10) and its interpreta-
tion in terms of a Z2 quantized Berry phase Eq. (11),
derived here for MSG75.5 (PC4), can be readily applied
to many other MSGs with gapped 2D planes in the Bril-
louin zone where [C2T]2 = +1. The simplest example
MSG3.4 (Pa2), obtained by forgetting the C4 symmetry,
has a Z2 symmetry indicator that readily corresponds to
z2 Eq. (10) [35]. For many MSGs though, there are sym-
metry indicated nodal points between the gapped planes,
i.e. similarly to MSG77.18 (PI42), such that they cannot
be identiﬁed by a (3D) symmetry indicator and they have
been listed as trivial [35].
C.
Chern and Weyl phases of type I MSGs
We have discussed in detail the transition from the
AFM Weyl phase of MSG75.5 (PC4), and MSG77.18
(PI42), to the sub-dimensional Chern insulating FM
phases of MSG75.1 (P4), and MSG77.13 (P42), re-
spectively, obtained upon the breaking of the non-
symmorphic TRS. The eﬀect of breaking TRS is to un-
lock the Weyl nodes that were pinned on the C2T planes,
so that they move within the Brillouin zone. We conclude
that the symmetry indicator Z4 of the type I MSG75.1
(P4) [35] indicates a We yl semi-metallic phase, while
there is no symmetry indicator for MSG77.13 (P42) [35]
with a Weyl semi-metallic phase that must be assessed
in terms of sub-dimensional topology.
In the same way as we predict many AFM phases with
C2T protected Weyl nodal phases, we predict many FM16
Weyl nodal phases indicated by sub-dimensional Chern
phases upon the breaking of the non-symmorphic TRS.
VIII.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, starting from the speciﬁc case study,
MSG 75.5 (PC4), we ﬁnd that speciﬁc Wyckoﬀpositions
(2b) in this magnetic ground group necessarily results in
(fragile) topological bands. In this regard we formulated
a ﬁrst generic model exhibiting fragile topology in the
context of magnetic space group symmetries. Breaking
the essential symmetry by a Zeeman term then relates
the underlying AFM-compatible MSG with a FM coun-
terpart in the same space group family and ensures that
the fragile topology gaps into bands with ﬁnite Chern
number. After translating the Z2 symmetry indicator of
the AFM MSG into a quantized Berry phase of a stable
topological semimetallic phase, which originates from the
combination of C4 symmetry and C2T-protected Euler
class topology, we also discuss a similar correspondence
to FM Chern phases. We thus unveil a systematic cor-
respondence between necessarily nontrivial topological
phases associated with MSG representations. Moreover,
we then promote this mechanism to three spatial dimen-
sions, where we also ﬁnd novel phases characterized by
the concept of subdimensional topologies. The latter fea-
ture the same in-plane mechanism but have 3D elemen-
tary band representations that are fully connected. As
a result, the non-trivial 2D topology must coexists with
nodes away from the high symmetry planes, e.g. Weyl
points, giving rise to additional topological nodal fea-
tures, such as Fermi arcs, that can be diagnosed with
established experimental methods. As a result, our work
culminates in an exhaustive list of tetragonal MSGs (with
the point groups C4 and S4) and their EBR content host-
ing the above correspondence. We have then addressed
the eﬀect of adding and removing unitary symmetries
that lead to the identiﬁcation of magnetic Dirac (four-
fold) points, and have outlined how the symmetry indi-
cated Weyl semi-metallic phases protected by C2T can
be found in numerous MSGs as a result of our reﬁned
subdimensional topological analysis. Given the general-
ity of these insights and relevance of parameters to access
this physics, we hope our results pave the way for new
pursuits in topological band structures. In fact, we an-
ticipate that this coexistence eﬀect, i.e. of gapped subdi-
mensional topology together with independent topolog-
ical nodes, can also occur in the non-magnetic context
culminating in novel gapped-nodal topological phases.

Note added.– We comment here on Ref. [106] that ap-
peared several months after the ﬁrst version of this paper
and has some overlap with our work. Among many re-
sults not covered by our work, they give a complete list
of MSGs that have z2 (called z4 in their work) as one
of the 3D symmetry indicators, including some of the
MSGs discussed here. While the scope of our work was
more restricted, our approach based on sub-dimensional
topologies, i.e. allowing symmetry indicated nodes be-
tween gapped planes, leads us to predict many more
MSGs with C2T protected Weyl semi-metallic phases.
Ref. [106] also considers other Weyl semi-metallic phases
in type I MSGs protected by IC4z symmetry, among
which are MSG81.33 (P¯4) and MSG82.39 (P¯4). Alter-
natively, these FM phases can be readily obtained, upon
the breaking of the non-symmorphic TRS, from the (sub-
dimensional) AFM Weyl phases of the following type
IV MSG81.36 (Pc¯4), MSG81.37 (PC¯4), MSG81.38 (PI¯4),
and MSG82.42 (Ic¯4), all listed in our table.17
Appendix A: Wilson loop winding for the fragile
topological phase
We algebraically derive the symmetry obstruction on
the winding of Wilson loop over one quarter of the
Brillouin zone, and following over the whole Brillouin
zone, for the valence (conduction) subspace of the split
EBR2b
75.5. For this we choose the patch of the Brillouin
zone bounded by lΓXΓ′ and lΓMΓ′, see Fig. 2c) (blue
dashed). We design a ﬂow starting with the base path
lΓXΓ′ and ending with lΓMΓ′. Deﬁning the Wilson loop
phases
{ϕ1, ϕ2} = Arg [eig{W[lΓXΓ′]}] ,
{ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2} = Arg [eig{W[lΓMΓ′]}] ,
(A1)
they must extrapolate smoothly between {ϕ1, ϕ2} and
{ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2} as we smoothly deform the base path from
lΓXΓ′ to lΓMΓ′.
The Wilson loop over an oriented
base path l : k1 →k2 is deﬁned through Wk2←k1 =
⟨u, k2| ˆW|u, k1⟩where |u, k1⟩is the matrix of Bloch
eigenvectors of the band subspace under consideration,
and
ˆW
= Qk2←k1
k
P(k) with the projector P(k) =
|u, k⟩⟨u, k|.
We now show that the crystal symmetries act as an
obstruction imposing the quantization of Wilson loop
phases. First, we ﬁnd
W[lΓXΓ′] = WΓ′←X · WX←Γ
= RΓ
2 · W−1
X←Γ · (RX
2 )−1 · WX←Γ,
(A2)
where R¯k
2 = ⟨u, Dπ¯k| ˆU(C2z)|u, ¯k⟩is the sewing ma-
trix of symmetry C2z at the high symmetry point ¯k
in the valence Bloch eigenvectors basis (with ˆU(C2z) =
1 ⊗−iσz the representation of C2z in the orbital ba-
sis |ϕ, k⟩, and Dπ is the rotation matrix by π around
the z-axis).
Writing |u, ¯k + K⟩= ˆT †(K)|u, ¯k⟩where
ˆT(K) = diag(eirAK, eirAK, eirBK, eirBK) accounts for
the phase factors due to the displacements of the sub-
lattice sites with respect to the origin of the unit cell,
we can rewrite R¯k
2
= ⟨u, ¯k| ˆT(Dπ¯k −¯k) ˆU(C2z)|u, ¯k⟩
which guarantees that the arbitrary gauge phase factors
are removed, and use |u, Dπ¯k⟩= ˆU(C2z)|u, ¯k⟩R¯k
2
† in
the following. We note that at C2z-invariant momenta,
i.e. Dπ¯k = ¯k + K with K a reciprocal lattice vector, we
have [ ˆT(K) ˆU(C2z), H(¯k)] = 0 and R¯k
2 is diagonal. Since
for the fragile phase (z2 = 0 mod 2, see Eq. 10) we have
RX
2 = (±)diag(i, i) and RΓ
2 = diag(i, −i) (see Table I), we
readily ﬁnd
{ϕ1, ϕ2} = {0, π} mod 2π.
(A3)
We emphasize that the quantization of the Wilson loop
over ΓXΓ′ comes from the repetition of the IRREPs at X
(equivalently at Γ). An alternative source of Wilson loop
quantization is when both Γ and X are TRIMs in which
case the Wilson loop phases are Kramers degenerated at
{0, 0} or {π, π}.
Considering now the base path lΓMΓ′, we have
W[lΓMΓ′] = WΓ′←M · WM←Γ
= RΓ
4 · W−1
M←Γ · (RM
4 )−1 · WM←Γ,
(A4)
where R¯k
4 = ⟨u, Dπ/2¯k| ˆU(C4z)|u, ¯k⟩= ⟨u, ¯k| ˆT(C4z¯k −
¯k) ˆU(C4z)|u, ¯k⟩is the representation in the basis of Bloch
eigenvectors of C4z at ¯k, with, in the orbital basis |ϕ, k⟩,
ˆU(C4z) = σx ⊗M4 where M4 = diag(e−iπ/4, eiπ/4), and
we have used |u, Dπ/2¯k⟩= ˆU(C4z)|u, ¯k⟩R¯k
4
†.
Using parallel transported Bloch eigenvectors the Wil-
son loop becomes diagonal, and we write f
WM←Γ =
diag(eiϕa, eiϕb). The above expression thus reduces to
f
W[lΓMΓ′] = eRΓ

Since at C4z-symmetric momenta the parallel trans-
ported Bloch eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of the C4z
operator, we retrieve irreducible representations eRΓ
4 =
(±)diag(ω, ω∗) and eRM
4
= (±)diag(ω, −ω∗), where the
signs depend on the coIRREPs realized at Γ and M (see
Table I).
The quantization of the Wilson loop f
W[lΓMΓ′] depends
on the relative spin-z components of the parallel trans-
ported Bloch eigenstates at Γ and M, see the discussion
in Ref. [38]. Writing eR¯k
4 = diag(ξ¯k
4 (Γa), ξ¯k
4 (Γb)), we ﬁnd
f
W[lΓMΓ′] =

ξΓ
4 (Γa)/ξM
4 (Ma)

(A6)
Assuming the same spin-z component at Γ and M,
e.g. with (Γa, Ma, Γb, Mb) = (Γ5, M8, Γ7, M5) (see Table
I), we ﬁnd
{ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2} = {π/4, π/4} mod 2π.
(A7)
This matches exactly with the direct numerical evalua-
tion of the Wilson loop shown in Fig. 2e) in the main
text. If instead we assume opposite spin-z components
at Γ and M, e.g. with (Γa, Ma, Γb, Mb) = (Γ5, M5, Γ7, M8)
(see Table I), we ﬁnd
{ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2} = {0, π} mod 2π.
(A8)
This later quantization thus corresponds to a system
where there is a twisting spin texture from Γ to M, which
would require strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling.
It thus follows that, in the absence of a twisted
spin texture, the Wilson loop phases must wind from
{ϕ1, ϕ2} = {0, π} to {ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2} = {π/4, π/4} mod 2π, as
we scan over one quarter of the Brillouin zone through the
deformation of the base path from lΓXΓ′ to lΓMΓ′. There
is thus a minimal winding of (∆ϕ1, ∆ϕ2) = (ϕ′
1, ϕ′
2) −
(ϕ1, ϕ2) = (+π/2, −π/2). By the action of C4 symme-
try we can recover the whole Brillouin zone for which we
predict a minimal winding of the Wilson loop phases of18
4(∆ϕ1, ∆ϕ2) = (+2π, −2π). This precisely predicts al-
gebraically the numerical evaluation of the Wilson loop
over the whole Brillouin zone shown in Fig. 2d).
We ﬁnally conclude that the valence (conduction) sub-
space of the split EBR2b
75.5 is topologically non-trivial as
indicated by the ﬁnite winding of Wilson loop phases.
Appendix B: Derivation of formula Eq. (14) and
Eq. (11)
We give here the algebraic derivation of the Wilson
loop over lq = ΓM’XMΓ (red loop in Fig. 2c)) as given in
Eq. (11), from which Eq. (14) readily follows by reducing
to a single band-subspace. We use the algebraic Wilson
loop techniques developed in [13, 79] and [6, 38, 86].
It is convenient to decompose the Wilson loop into the
contributions of each segment that connects two succes-
sive high-symmetry points, i.e. W[lq] = WdWcWbWa,
with
Wa = ⟨u, Γ| ˆW|u, M⟩,
Wc = ⟨u, X| ˆW|u, M′⟩,
Wb = ⟨u, M′| ˆW|u, Γ⟩, Wd = ⟨u, M| ˆW|u, X⟩,
(B1)
where M’ = M −b2.
We now use symmetries to rewrite Wa and Wd, as
Wa = ⟨u, Γ| ˆW|u, M⟩= ⟨u, C4zΓ| ˆW|u, C4zM’⟩

ﬂows for MSG75.1 (P4)
We present here the numerical evaluation of the non-
triviality of the case MSG75.1 (P4), i.e. for the model
Eq. (4) with an additional Zeeman coupling. In Fig. 12.
we show the numerically obtained Berry phase for the
individual bands of the band structure in Fig. 5 obtained
for the model of MSG75.1 (P4). These evaluations cor-
roborate the analytical results. That is, each band shows
a ﬁnite Chern number C. While bands 2 and 3 exhibit a
value of C = 1, the other two bands have opposite Chern
number.
Finally, we also show in Fig. 13 the Berry
phase of the bands as obtained from gapping the sta-
ble nodal topological MSG75.5 (PC4) band structure of
Fig. 3. As described in the main text, the resulting spec-
trum features a single band (band number two in this
case) with Chern number C = −3, whereas the others
exhibit a Chern number C = 1.
Appendix D: Details on symmetry indicator analysis
We here give further detail on the symmetry indicator
analysis for some of the MSGs considered.19

Symmetry indicators for MSG75.5 (PC4)
MSG75.5 (PC4) is derived from SG75 by including the
operator (E|τ)′ with τ = 1
2(a1+a2). We can thus classify
the possible band structures for our model by consider-
ing the IRREPs of SG75, and pair them appropriately
to form coIRREPs of MSG75.5 (PC4), as described in
[35]. The full compatibility relations[23] and EBRs for
SG75 can be found on the Bilbao Crystallographic
Server[69]. Using their notation (see also Table I), the
compatibility relations for the Γ point are given by:
Γ5 →Z5
Γ6 →Z6
Γ7 →Z7
Γ7 →Z8
(D1)
The compatibility relations between M and A display
a similar structure. Finally, the compatibility relations
between X and R are:
X3 →R3
X4 →R4
(D2)
From the above relations it is evident that it suﬃces to
consider the points Γ, X and M as the compatibility rela-
tions uniquely link IRREPs at these points to all IRREPs
at all other high-symmetry points in the 3D BZ [23].
To form the coIRREPs, we consider the additional con-
straints imposed by the antiunitary symmetries. These
can be determined from the Herring rule [57] applied at
each high-symmetry point. We only consider spinful IR-
REPs. At Γ and M (and A and Z), this gives pairing of
inequivalent IRREPs. At X (and R), no additional pair-
ing is required. To determine which IRREPs are paired
to form the coIRREPs at Γ and M, we pair represen-
tations of g with representations of AgA−1, where g is
an element of the unitary little group at Γ or M and
A = (E|τ)′. The allowed pairings at Γ are Γ5Γ7, Γ6Γ8
and the pairings at M are M 6M 7, M 5M 8.
The magnetic EBRs for the MSG75.5 (PC4) can be
found from the EBRs for SG75 [69]. We note that the
vector τ relates WP 1a (0, 0) and 1b (1/2, 1/2) in SG75,
so the EBRs from these WPs are paired. Similarly, τ
maps WP 2c (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0) in SG75 to itself, so we
pair EBRs at WP 2c directly. We can uniquely determine
which EBRs are paired, by realizing that the magnetic
EBRs must satisfy the magnetic compatibility relations
detailed above. This gives the following magnetic EBRs
for MSG75.5 (PC4) (using the WP labels from SG75):
(1a :
1E1 + 1b :
2E2) ↑G = (Γ6Γ8, M 6M 7, 2X3)
(1a :
1E2 + 1b :
2E1) ↑G = (Γ5Γ7, M 5M 8, 2X3)
(1a :
2E1 + 1b :
1E2) ↑G = (Γ6Γ8, M 5M 8, 2X4)
(1a :
2E2 + 1b :
1E1) ↑G = (Γ5Γ6, M 6M 7, 2X4)
(2c :
1E + 2c :
2E) ↑G = (Γ5Γ6Γ7Γ8, M 5M 6M 7M 8, 2X42X3)
To compute the symmetry indicators, as described in
[35], we compute the Smith normal form of the matrix
of EBRs. This gives the indicator group for MSG75.5
(PC4) as Z2, in agreement with [35].
From our magnetic EBRs, we see that it is not possible
to construct a band structure with an odd number of20
bands in the X3 (or equivalently the X4) IRREP from
an integer combination of magnetic EBRs. Every other
combination consistent with the compatibility relations
can be constructed from the magnetic EBRs. Thus, the
Z2 indicator can be conveniently computed as:
nX3 mod 2,
(D3)
in agreement with the expression in the main text.
2.
Symmetry indicators for MSG77.18 (PI42)
MSG77.18 (PI42) is formed from SG77, by including
the operator (E|τ)′ with τ = 1
2(a1 + a2 + a3). For the
C4 symmetric points (Γ,Z,M,A), the Herring test gives
the same result as for 75.5.
At X, the Herring test
gives that the antiunitary symmetries impose no further
degeneracies, whereas at R, the Herring test gives that
each IRREP must be doubly degenerate.
Additional
degeneracies are imposed by the non-symmorphic sym-
metry elements of SG77. For the C4 symmetric points,
the non-symmorphic symmetries constrain that the
IRREPs must switch partners when moving through the
BZ. This enforces gap closings along the kz direction,
which acts as an obstruction to deﬁning two-band
subspaces across the entire BZ, see ﬁgure 7a) and c).
Thus the minimal connectivity of bands in the BZ is 4.

of MSG77.18 (PI42), and by checking the compatibility
relations, we realize that IRREPs 1E pairs with 2E at
the diﬀerent sites. Thus, we get three spinful magnetic
EBRs, which are given by (using the WP labels from
SG77):

Using the Smith normal form decomposition as before,
we see that there’s no nontrivial indicator in this MSG,
in agreement with [35].

Symmetry indicator for MSG81.36 (Pc¯4)
As a ﬁnal example, we here compute the symmetry in-
dicators for MSG81.36 (Pc¯4), as an example of an MSG
with S4 rotoinversion symmetry.
This MSG is gener-
ated from SG81 by including the operator (E|τ)′ with
τ = 1
2a3. SG81 is similar to SG75, but the C4 rotations
are combined with inversion. The Herring test gives that
the C2 IRREPs must glue together at the C2 symmetric
points X and R. At the C4 symmetric points, the Her-
ring test glues together Γ5Γ7 and Γ6Γ8 respectively, and
similarly at M. At Z, Z5Z8 and Z6Z7 glue together re-
spectively, and similarly at A. This assignment satisﬁes
the compatibility relations, so the minimal connectivity
of bands in the BZ is 2, and two-band subspaces can be
deﬁned throughout the BZ.
To compute the symmetry indicator group, we note that
τ connects WP 1a (0, 0, 0) and 1b (0, 0, 1/2) of SG81 to
form magnetic WP 2a.
Similarly, WP 1c (1/2, 1/2, 0)
and 1d (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) of SG81 connect to form mag-
netic WP 2c. Some of the non-maximal WPs of SG81
become maximal WPs for MSG81.36 (Pc¯4), e.g.
WP
2e (0, 0, z), (0, 0, −z) of SG81 goes into maximal mag-
netic WP 2b (0, 0, 1/4), (0, 0, 3/4), and similarly for non-
magnetic WP 2f going into magnetic WP 2d. As the
EBRs at these WPs have to satisfy compatibility rela-
tions, however, it is straightforward to investigate which
site-symmetry IRREPs to pair. This gives the following
magnetic EBRs (labelled using the WPs of SG81):21
(1a :
1E1 + 1b :
2E1) ↑G = (Γ6Γ8, Z6Z7, M 6M 8, A6A7, X3X4, R3R4)
(1a :
1E2 + 1b :
2E2) ↑G = (Γ5Γ7, Z5Z8, M 5M 7, A5A8, X3X4, R3R4)
(1a :

(1a :

(1c :

(1c :

(1c :
2E1 + 1b :
1E1) ↑G = (Γ6Γ8, Z5Z8, M 5M 7, A6A7, X3X4, R3R4)
(1c :
2E2 + 1d :
1E2) ↑G = (Γ5Γ7, Z6Z7, M 6M 8, A5A8, X3X4, R3R4)
(2e :
1E + 2e :
2E) ↑G = (Γ5Γ6Γ7Γ8, Z5Z6Z7Z8, M 5M 6M 7M 8, A5A6A7A8, 2X32X4, 2R32R4)
(2f :
1E + 2f :
2E) ↑G = (Γ5Γ6Γ7Γ8, Z5Z6Z7Z8, M 5M 6M 7M 8, A5A6A7A8, 2X32X4, 2R32R4)
Computing the Smith normal form gives a single Z2 fac-
tor. Inspecting the solution space, we see that the corre-
sponding indicator is given by whether the IRREPs at the
C4 invariant points contain an odd or an even number of
representations with subscript 5 (or any other subscript).
Thus, an explicit expression for the symmetry indicator
is:
z′
2 = nΓ5 + nZ5 + nM 5 + nA5 mod 2
(D4)
It has been shown in [36] for MSG81.33 (P¯4) that this
symmetry indicator relates to a 3D axion topological in-
sulating phase.
We ﬁnally note that our results in this Appendix
agree with general expressions for magnetic EBRs,
compatibility relations and symmetry indicators in [36],
which we became aware of during the ﬁnalizing stages of
this manuscript.

[98] In case of CEF, the quantization of the Wilson loop over
the base path ΓXΓ′ follows either from the condition
that ξΓ
2 (1) = ξΓ
2 (2) (equivalently, ξM
2 (1) = ξM
2 (2)), or if
both Γ and X are TRIMs in which case the Wilson loop
phases are also Kramers degenerate at {0, 0} or {π, π}.
