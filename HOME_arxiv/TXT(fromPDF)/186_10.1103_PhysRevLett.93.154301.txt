The coeﬃcient of normal restitution in an oblique impact is theoretically studied. Using a two-
dimensional lattice model for an elastic disk and an elastic wall, we demonstrate that the coeﬃcient
of normal restitution can exceed unity and has a peak against the incident angle in our simulation.
We also explain this behavior based upon a phenomenological theory.
The coeﬃcient of normal restitution e is introduced to
determine the normal component of the post-collisional
velocity in the collision of two materials. The coeﬃcient
e is deﬁned by
v(τc) · n = −ev(0) · n,
(1)
where v(τ) is the relative velocity of the centers of mass
of two colliding materials at time τ measured from the
initial contact, τc is the duration of a collision, and n
is the unit vector normal to the contact plane. Though
some text books of elementary physics state that e is
a material constant, many experiments and simulations
show that e decreases with increasing impact velocity[1].
The dependence of e on the low impact velocity is theo-
retically treated by the quasi-static theory [2, 3, 4]. We
also recognize that e can be less than unity for the normal
impact without the introduction of any explicit dissipa-
tion, because the macroscopic inelasticities originate in
the transfer of the energy from the translational mode to
the internal modes such as the vibrations[3, 5, 6].
While e has been believed to be less than unity in
most situations, it is recently reported that e can exceed
unity in oblique impacts[7, 8, 9]. In particular, Louge
and Adams[9] observed oblique impacts of a hard alu-
minum oxide sphere on a thick elastoplastic polycarbon-
ate plate and found that e grows monotonically with the
magnitude of the tangent of the incident angle γ.
In
their experiment, Young’s modulus of the plate is 100
times smaller than that of the aluminum oxide sphere.
They also suggested that e can exceed unity for the most
oblique impacts.
In
this
letter,
we
demonstrate
that
our
two-
dimensional simulation of the oblique impact based on
Hamilton’s equation has yielded an increasing e with
tan γ and e exceeds unity at the critical incident angle.
Finally, we explain our results by our phenomenological
theory.
Let us introduce our numerical model[10]. Our model
consists of an elastic disk and an elastic wall (Fig. 1).
The width and the height of the wall are 8R and 2R, re-
spectively, where R is the mean radius of the undeformed
disk. The both side ends and the bottom of the wall are
ﬁxed.
We place 800 mass points at random in a disk
γ

with the radius R and 4000 mass points at random in a
wall for the disk and the wall, respectively. We connect
each mass point with its neighbor mass points by the
Delaunay triangulation algorithm[11], and undeformed
nonlinear springs are placed on all the connections.
Each mass point i on the lower half boundary of the
disk feels the force, F(l(i)
s ) = aV0 exp(−al(i)
s )n(i)
s , where
l(i)
s
is the distance between i-th surface mass point of
the disk and the nearest surface spring of the wall, a =
300/R, V0 = amc2R/2, m is the mass of each mass point,
c is the one-dimensional velocity of sound, and n(i)
s
is
the unit vector normal to the connection between two
surface mass points of the wall [10]. We should note that
the strong repulsion F(l(i)
s ) is introduced to inhibit the
penetration of the disk to the surface of the wall[5]. Thus,
the dynamical equation of motion for each mass point i
of the lower half boundary of the disk is described by

(2)
where ri is the position of i-th mass point, Ni is the num-2
ber of mass points connected to i-th mass point, xij is
the relative deformation of the spring between i-th and
j-th connected mass points, ka and kb = ka × 10−3/R2
are the spring constants.
Here we introduce the step
function Θ(x), i.e. Θ(x) = 1 for x ≥0 and Θ(x) = 0
for x < 0, and the threshold length lth which is the av-
erage of the natural lengths of the springs of the disk.
For internal mass points, the last term of the right hand
side of eq.(2) is omitted.
In most of our simulations,
we adopt ka = k(d)
a
= 1.0 × mc2/R2 for the disk and
ka = k(w)
a
= 1.0×10−2mc2/R2 for the wall. We do not in-
troduce any dissipative mechanism in this model. Thus,
during a collision, a part of initial translational energy of
the disk is distributed into the vibrational energy of the
disk and the wall. It should be noted that the macro-
scopic dissipation can be interpreted as the irreversible
transfer of the energy from the translational motion to
the internal vibration. When we introduce explicit dis-
sipations in the model and add the gravity to the disk,
we have conﬁrmed that the compression of the disk can
be described by two-dimensional Hertzian contact theory
[12].
In this model, the roughness of the surfaces is impor-
tant to make the disk rotate after a collision[10].
We
modify the positions of the surface mass points of the
ﬂat wall and the smooth disk by using normal random
numbers whose average and standard deviation are 0 and
3 × 10−2R, respectively.
Poisson’s ratio ν and Young’s modulus E of this model
can be evaluated by adding the external force to stretch
the rectangle of random lattice numerically. We obtain
Poisson’s ratio ν = (7.50±0.11)×10−2 and Young’s mod-
ulus E = (9.54 ± 0.231) × 103mc2/R2, respectively[10].
We solve the dynamical equation of motion (2) for each
mass point with the initial speed |v(0)| = 0.1c and the
incident angle γ, and determine e for each γ according
to eq.(1). All the results in this letter are obtained by
averaging the results of 100 disks with diﬀerent conﬁgura-
tions of mass points. We use the fourth order symplectic
integrator with the time step ∆τ = 10−3R/c.
Figure 2 is the relation between e and Ψ1 ≡−(v(0) ·
t)/(v(0) · n) = tan γ, where t is the unit vector vertical
to n. The cross point is the mean value and the error bar
is the standard deviation of 100 samples for each γ. This
result shows that e increases with increasing Ψ1 to exceed
unity, and has a peak around Ψ1 = 6.0. The behavior of
e having the peak is contrast to that in the experiment
by Louge and Adams[9].
Here, let us explain our results. Louge and Adams[9]
suggest that their results can be explained by the rota-
tion of the normal unit vector n arising from the local
deformation of the wall’s surface. Thus, we aim to deter-
mine the angle of rotation of the unit vector α at each γ
from the theory of elasticity.

Assuming that l is small compared to R, the perimeter
of the contact is approximated by
f(x) = (x −xc)2/2R −yc,
(3)
where (xc, yc) is the lowest position of the disk. To cal-
culate tan α ≡(f(xb) −f(xa))/l, we need to know the
ratio of |xc −xa| to l. From the theory of elasticity[13],
this ratio can be estimated as

where µ is the coeﬃcient of the friction. We evaluate µ
by µ ≡|J·t|/|J·n| with J = M(v(τ)−v(0)), where M is
the mass of the disk. The cross points in Fig.4 represent
µ calculated from our simulation, where µ has a peak
around Ψ1 = 3.0. From eqs.(3) and (4), tan α is given by

where we evaluate |xc −xa| = 0.55R from the maximum
value of the compression of the disk. From eqs.(4) and
(5), we obtain the relation between Ψ1 and tan α.
Next, let us calculate e from the relation between Ψ1
and tan α.
We introduce the rotated unit vectors, nα
and tα, as nα = cos αn−sin αt and tα = sin αn+cos αt,
respectively. By introducing eα ≡−(v(τc) · nα)/(v(0) ·
nα), we can express e in terms of eα as
e = eα + Ψα
2 tan α
1 −Ψα
1 tan α ,
(6)
where Ψα
1 = −(v(0) · tα)/(v(0) · nα) and Ψα
2 = −(v(τc) ·
tα)/(v(0) · nα). Ψα
1 also can be rewritten as
Ψα
1 = (Ψ1 −tan α)/(1 + Ψ1 tan α).
(7)
On the other hand, in the oblique impact of slipping
disks, Ψα
2 is given by
Ψα
2 = Ψα
1 −3(1 + eα)µα
(8)
in the two-dimensional situation[14]. In eq.(8), µα, de-
ﬁned by µα = |J · tα|/|J · nα|, is given by
µα = µ + tan α
1 −µ tan α.
(9)
To draw the solid line in Fig.2, at ﬁrst, we calculate µ
and tan α for each Ψ1. By choosing a ﬁtting parame-
ter eα = 0.95 and substituting eqs.(7)-(9) into eq.(6) we
obtain e as a function of α, µ, and Ψ1. All points are
interpolated with the cubic spline interpolation method
to draw the solid curve. Such the theoretical description
of e is qualitatively consistent with our numerical result,
though the theoretical value is a little smaller than the
observed value.

FIG. 4: Numerical and theoretical results of the relation be-

Now, let us consider how µ depends on Ψ1 based on
a phenomenological argument.
For simplicity, we re-
place the roughness on the surface of the wall by a pe-
riodic array of asperities.
When the disk hits one as-
perity, a fraction of the energy is absorbed in the wall.
We assume that the tangential velocity v(i−1)
t
changes
to v(i)
t
= (1 −η)v(i−1)
t
when the disk hits the i-th as-
perity.
Thus, if the disk contacts N asperities during
the impact, the tangential speed at the release point be-
comes vt(τc) = v(N)
t
= (1 −η)Nvt(0). Here we estimate
the number of contacted asperities during the collision
as N = ρlsl, where ρ is the number of the asperities
in a unit length on the surface and lsl is the length
of sliding which can be evaluated as lsl = vt(0)τc with
τc = π(R/c)
p
ln (4c/vn(0))[6]. Thus, the tangential im-
pulse Jt ≡J · t is approximated by
Jt = M{(1 −η)ρlsl −1}vt(0) ≃−ηMρlslvt(0),
(10)
where we assume small η. Now, we should answer the
question how to determine η. When the impact velocity
is large enough, η becomes smaller because the asperities
are broken down when the disk hits them.
Therefore
we may assume the form η = η0/(1 + βv2
t (0)/v2
n(0)) =
η0/(1 + βΨ2
1) with the introduction of the dimensionless
parameters η0 and β. Taking into account Jn ≡J · n =
−M(1+e)vn(0) and the deﬁnition of µ = Jt/Jn we obtain

1/(1 + Ψ2
1). We adopt the numerical results for the
value of e at each Ψ1 (Fig.2) and |v(0)|/c = 0.1. The solid
curve in Fig.4 is eq.(11) with ﬁtting parameters β = 0.21
and η0ρR = 0.18, which reproduces our numerical result.
We do not claim that our simple argument explains the
experimental result because of two ﬁtting parameters.
However, we would like to emphasize that our picture
captures the essence of the behavior of µ in the oblique
impact.
Let us discuss our result.
First, we emphasize that
the novel phenomena of e exceeding unity are obtained
from the local deformation of the soft wall for the oblique
impacts of a hard disk. When we simulate the impact
between a disk and a hard wall, for k(w)
a
= 10 × k(d)
a ,
e ﬂuctuates around a constant to exceed unity abruptly
around Ψ1 = 4.5[12]. This tendency resembles the exper-
imental results by Calsamiglia et al.[8]. Thus, for smooth
increase of e to exceed unity, the wall should be softer
than the disk. In addition, it is important to ﬁx the ini-
tial kinetic energy of the disk. So far, we have conﬁrmed
that e does not exceed unity when Ψ1 is controlled by
changing vt with ﬁxed vn[10].
The second, the initial velocity of the disk and the lo-
cal deformation of the wall are much larger than those in
the experimental ones in ref.[9]. They cause the most sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between our result and their result[9].
Because of the high speed impact in our case, there is
a peak of e for small γ.
In fact, our simulation with
|v(0)| = 0.01c shows the shift of the peak for larger4
γ. Therefore, we expect that our model reproduces the
result of ref.[9] for the low impact speed. In addition,
we have carried out simulations with a disk of 400 mass
points and a wall of 2000 mass points to check the eﬀect
of the system size. Although there is a slight diﬀerence
between the results, the data are also well reproducible
by our phenomenological theory.
The third, the local deformation of the wall also aﬀects
the relation between µ and Ψ1. In early studies, it has
been shown that µ depends on the impact velocity [9, 15].
In our simulation, µ has a peak around Ψ1 = 3.0. This
behavior is interpreted as that the asperities are ﬂattened
for large vt. Equation (11) indicates that µ can increase
with increasing γ as in ref.[9] if we choose a suitable set
of β and η0ρ. The diﬀerence between the results of their
experiment and our simulation may be explained by the
choice of these parameters.
The fourth, we adopt the static theory of elasticity to
explain our numerical results in this letter. However, it
is important to solve the time-dependent equation of the
deformation of the wall’s surface to analyze the dynamics
of impact phenomena. The dynamical analysis will be
our future task.
In ﬁnal, we indicate that the friction coeﬃcient is de-
rived from our Hamiltonian model. This friction comes
from the irreversible energy transfer of the macroscopic
translational motion to the internal vibration. The irre-
versibility is indeed related to the second law of thermo-
dynamics if the number of the internal degrees of free-
dom is inﬁnite. However, the irreversibility in our sys-
tem which includes only 103 mass points in a disk is in-
complete as we can see that the Hertzian contact theory
cannot be recovered without introduction of the explicit
dissipation. We believe that the complete treatment of
inelastic collision of macroscopic materials without intro-
duction of dissipations will be a fundamental subject of
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
In summary, we have carried out the two-dimensional
simulation of the oblique impact of an elastic disk on an
elastic wall. We have found that e can exceed unity in
the oblique impact, which is attributed to the local de-
formation of the wall. We have estimated the magnitude
of the local defomation α based on the static theory of
elasticity and derived the relation between e and Ψ1 by
taking into account the rotation of the normal unit vec-
tor of the wall’s surface. The relation between µ and Ψ1
is also related to the local deformation and is explained
by the simple argument.
