Abstract
We report a clear correspondence between changes in the Curie temperature and carrier density
upon annealing in epitaxially grown (Ga,Mn)As layers with thicknesses in the range between 5 nm
and 20 nm. The changes are dependent on the layer thickness, indicating that the (Ga,Mn)As -
GaAs interface has importance for the physical properties of the (Ga,Mn)As layer. The magnetore-
sistance shows additional features when compared to thick (Ga,Mn)As layers, that are at present
of unknown origin.

1The discovery of ferromagnetism in the dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As [1]
initiated a rapid expansion in both the experimental and theoretical investigation of this
material. Ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As is commonly related to the magnetic exchange
interaction between the conduction holes and the magnetic moment of the localized sub-
stitutional Mn+2 ions. [2] In the Zener model, the ferromagnetic ordering temperature (Tc)
is directly related to the content of Mn and the number of free charge carriers. [2] The
low temperature conditions necessary for epitaxial growth of (Ga,Mn)As, induces defects
such as Mn-interstitials [3] and As-antisites [4] that act as compensating donors and hence
suppress ferromagnetic ordering. Experimental work has shown that Tc, together with the
electrical transport properties, can be changed by post-growth annealing, [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and
Curie temperatures up to 150 K have now been reported. [7] The main mechanism for this
is believed to be a reduction of Mn interstitials which are highly mobile in the annealing
temperature range commonly used. [3] So far single (Ga,Mn)As layers with thicknesses in
the nm range have not been investigated in great detail. Matsukura et al. [10] reported a
decrease in Tc with increasing layer thickness, which is also observed by Ku et al., [7] who
also investigated the eﬀect of annealing.
We have previously found that the eﬀect of post-growth annealing on the shape of the
magnetization curve and Curie temperature, depends on the thickness of the (Ga,Mn)As
layer. [11] In this paper we present results of the eﬀect of post-growth annealing on the
carrier density determined from Hall measurements in the same Ga0.95Mn0.05As ﬁlms. We
found that the carrier density follows the changes in Tc upon annealing, in agreement with
what is generally seen in (Ga,Mn)As. [6, 7, 8] Ferromagnetism has been observed down to
a thickness of 5 nm. [12] In this sample, an unexplained feature in the magnetoresistance
appear at low temperatures. We show here that this feature is also present in thicker samples
with thicknesses up to 20 nm.
The studied samples are epitaxially grown Ga0.95Mn0.05As layers with thicknesses in the
range between 5 and 25 nm, embedded in low temperature (LT) GaAs. [11, 12] For electrical
transport measurements mesas are deﬁned in a 100 µm wide Hallbar geometry by UV-
lithography and wet chemical etching with Au/Zn/Au contacts. Annealing is performed at
240 ◦C in a Nitrogen atmosphere. Two sets of samples were annealed for one and two hours
respectively, except the 15 nm thick layer that was annealed an additional hour without any
signiﬁcant change in Curie temperature from that observed after two hours of annealing. [11]
2The Hall measurements are all standard 4-point dc-measurements performed at T=300 mK.
For (Ga,Mn)As a positive magnetoresistance in Hall measurements below Tc at low ﬁelds,
is evidence of in-plane magnetic anisotropy. [13] This is followed by a negative magnetoresis-
tance that has been understood as a reduction of random spin-ﬂip scattering with increasing
magnetic ﬁeld for metallic samples. [13, 14]
The Hall resistance contains two contributions: ordinary and anomalous Hall coeﬃcients
and is given by:
RH = Ro
d B + RS
d M
(1)
Ro = 1/pe is the ordinary Hall coeﬃcient. RS is the anomalous Hall coeﬃcient where Skew-
and Side-jump scattering contribute with terms given by RS ∝Rsheet and RS ∝R2
sheet re-
spectively. M is the magnetization of the sample and d is the thickness of the (Ga,Mn)As
ﬁlm. Recently a quadratic dependence on the resistivity of the anomalous Hall eﬀect con-
sistent with a scattering independent anomalous Hall conductivity has been reported. [5]
Below Tc, the anomalous Hall term leads to a rapid increase in Hall resistance with
increasing magnetic ﬁeld, often followed by a small decrease due to the negative magnetore-
sistance. Therefor it is often necessary to apply a high magnetic ﬁeld in order to determine
the carrier density from the ordinary Hall-term.
Figure 1 shows the Hall- and magnetoresistance of the 15 nm thick layer annealed for
three hours. Beside the eﬀects described above, there is an additional oscillating feature at
around 3 T and 4.5 T. This feature, varying in magnitude, is seen in all the samples with
thicknesses below 20 nm. Annealing has some eﬀect on the magnitude and magnetic ﬁeld
dependence of this oscillation, but no direct connection could be found. For some samples
the oscillation appears in the Hall resistance with the same magnetic ﬁeld dependence as in
the magnetoresistance, probably originating from the anomalous Hall term. The oscillating
feature is seen to disappear at higher temperatures.
The carrier density (p) has been found by ﬁtting the Hall data to eq. (1) for samples
with (Ga,Mn)As layer thickness up to 20 nm assuming either Skew or Side-jump scattering.
The results assuming only Skew scattering are shown in Fig. 2b. There is a small diﬀerence
in the determined carrier density, which increases with increasing layer thickness, depending
on the assumed scattering mechanism where Skew scattering gives the highest values. The
negative magnetoresistance increases with increasing layer thickness, and the carrier density
could not be determined in the 25 nm thick layer, in the available magnetic ﬁeld range.
3The carrier density increases upon annealing except for the 5 nm layer, where it decreases.
The increase upon annealing is consistent with the reported decrease in the amount of Mn
interstitials. [3]
The Curie temperatures, shown in Fig. 2a, are also seen to increase during annealing.
The Curie temperatures have been determined by SQUID magnetometery [11] except for
the 5 nm thick layer, which was determined from Hall measurements. [12] This observation
is contrary to recently reported results, where the presence of a capping layer reduces Tc in
10-50 nm thick (Ga,Mn)As layers upon annealing. [7]
The mean free path (l), calculated from the measured resistivity and carrier density at
T=300 mK, is shown in Fig. 2d. The obtained l values are in the range between 0.4 nm and
0.65 nm, which is shorter than the average distance between Mn-ions in (Ga,Mn)As with 5
% of Mn (∼1.1 nm). These low values for the mean free path is expected due to the high
degree of disorder in low temperature grown (Ga,Mn)As. The increasing mean free path
upon annealing is a consequence of reduced disorder.
The clear correspondence between the carrier density and Curie temperature seen in Fig.
2a and Fig. 2b, suggests that the Curie temperature is mainly governed by the number
of carriers, and not directly related to the thickness of the layer.
In Fig.
3 the Curie
temperature is plotted as a function of carrier density for the two sets of samples, where the
carrier density has been determined assuming either Skew- or Side-jump scattering. From
a log-log plot the Curie temperature is seen to follow a p1/3 dependence to a good degree,
when the carrier density is determined by Skew scattering only. This dependence is less
clear assuming only Side-jump scattering. Having data only in the range of half a decade
makes a ﬁt to the relation: Tc ∝p1/3, predicted by Dietl et al. [2] within the Zener model,
questionable. Using a Mn content of 5% the term of proportionality deviates by a factor
of 2 from the value given by ref.
[2] when assuming Skew scattering. This is acceptable
considering the uncertainty on the Mn content and material parameters.
Though it is diﬃcult to speculate as to what mechanisms are important in (Ga,Mn)As thin
ﬁlms, [7] these ﬁndings suggest that the (Ga,Mn)As - LT GaAs interface plays an important
role. Theoretical calculations show that Mn ions in substitutional and interstitial positions
have diﬀerent energies near the surface, [15] and experiments have found segregation of Mn
on the surface of (Ga,Mn)As. [16] This implies that annealing may have a larger impact
on (Ga,Mn)As layers with thickness comparable to the interface regions and that the Curie
4temperature is mainly governed by the carrier density and hence the number of defects.
In summary, we have observed a clear correspondence between changes in Curie tempera-
ture and carrier density upon annealing, suggesting that the impact of defects on the carrier
density is dependent on the (Ga,Mn)As layer thickness. A local maxima in the magnetore-
sistance at 3-4.5 T present only in layers with thickness below 20 nm is observed, indicating
that this is a thin ﬁlm property.
