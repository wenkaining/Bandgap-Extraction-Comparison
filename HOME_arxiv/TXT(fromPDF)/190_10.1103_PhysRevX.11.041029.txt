A notable phenomenon in topological semimetals is the violation of Kohler’s rule, which dictates that the 
magnetoresistance MR obeys a scaling behavior of MR = f(H/r0), where MR = [r(H)-r0]/r0 and H is the 
magnetic field, with r(H) and r0 being the resistivity at H and zero field, respectively. Here we report a 
violation originating from thermally-induced change in the carrier density. We find that the 
magnetoresistance of the Weyl semimetal, TaP, follows an extended Kohler’s rule MR = f[H/(nTr0)], with 
nT describing the temperature dependence of the carrier density. We show that nT is associated with the 
Fermi level and the dispersion relation of the semimetal, providing a new way to reveal information on 
the electronic bandstructure. We offer a fundamental understanding of the violation and validity of 
Kohler’s rule in terms of different temperature-responses of nT. We apply our extended Kohler’s rule to 
BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 to settle a long-standing debate on the scaling behavior of the normal-state 
magnetoresistance of a superconductor, namely, MR ~ tan2qH, where qH is the Hall angle. We further 
validate the extended Kohler’s rule and demonstrate its generality in a semiconductor, InSb, where the 
temperature-dependent carrier density can be reliably determined both theoretically and experimentally.2 
I. Introduction 
The magnetic-field-induced resistance change is conventionally termed as magnetoresistance (MR)1. In 
1938, Max Kohler2 developed a rule to account for the magnetoresistances in metals. Kohler’s rule states 
that the magnetoresistance MR should be a function of the ratio H/r0 of the magnetic field H to the zero-
field resistivity r0. That is, the field dependence of the magnetoresistances should exhibit a scaling 
behavior of MR = f(H/r0), where MR = [r(H)-r0]/r0 with r(H) and r0 being the resistivity at H and zero field 
at a fixed temperature, respectively. Kohler’s rule of the magnetoresistances has been observed in 
materials3-15 beyond metals and recently has been extensively used to understand novel 
magnetoresistance behavior such as the ‘turn-on’ temperature behavior of the magnetoresistance in 
topological materials5-15. Violations of Kohler’s rule have been often reported16-40 and used as evidence for 
phase transitions16,17 or for emergent new physics18-22. Here we explore Kohler’s rule of 
magnetoresistances in Weyl semimetals, where both its validity5,6,8 and violation23-25,27,28 have been 
reported, with the aim to uncover the role played by the inevitable thermally induced change in the 
density of carriers on the scaling behavior. We find that the magnetoresistance of the Weyl semimetal, 
tantalum phosphide (TaP), follows an extended Kohler’s rule MR = f[H/(nTr0)], where nT describes the 
relative change induced by thermal excitation in the carrier density, with nT = 1 denoting the original 
Kohler’s rule. We outline an innovative approach to obtain nT without knowing the values of the carrier 
density, providing a new way to probe the temperature dependence of carrier density. We show that nT 
is associated with the Fermi level and the dispersion relation, thereby revealing information on the 
electronic bandstructure. We offer a fundamental description of the violation and validity of Kohler’s rule 
in terms of different temperature responses of nT. In particular, Kohler’s rule is expected to be violated in 
materials with low carrier density where a noticeable density change due to thermal excitation occurs, 
while Kohler’s rule should hold in materials where the carrier density is high enough such that its 
thermally-induced change is experimentally indiscernible. Furthermore, by investigating the scaling 
behavior of the normal-state magnetoresistance in superconducting BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 crystals, we3 
demonstrate that our extended Kohler’s rule can account for the scaling MR ~ tan2qH where qH is the Hall 
angle, which was first observed in cuprate superconductors YBa2Cu3O7-d and La2SrxCuO4 [18] and has led 
to a long-standing debate in describing the normal-state magnetoresistance of a superconductor19-21,33-41. 
We also demonstrate the generality of our extended Kohler’s rule in an undoped narrow-gap 
semiconductor, indium antimonide (InSb). At high temperatures, InSb is a compensated two-band system 
with high-mobility electrons and low-mobility holes, enabling us to determine the carrier density via Hall 
measurements and use its temperature dependence to test the validity of the nT  term in our extended 
Kohler’s rule. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Data reported here were obtained from two TaP crystals (sample TP1 and sample TP2), two BaFe2(As1-
xPx)2 crystals with x = 0.25 (sample PL) and x = 0.5 (sample PH), and one undoped InSb crystal (sample IS). 
Preparation of samples. (1) TaP: Centimeter-sized single crystals of TaP were grown using the vapor 
transport method in two steps. In the first step, 3 grams of Ta (Beantown Chemical, 99.95%) and P 
(Beantown Chemical, 99.999%) powders were weighed, mixed, and ground in a glovebox. The mixed 
powders were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube which was subsequently heated to 700°C and sintered 
for 20 hours for a pre-reaction. In the second step, the obtained TaP powder along with 0.4 grams of I2 
(Sigma Aldrich, ³99.8%) were sealed in a new evacuated quartz tube, and was subsequently placed in a 
two-zone furnace with zone temperatures of 900°C and 950°C, respectively. The crystal growth time was 
14 days. Due to the very high electrical conductivity of TaP, it is difficult to carry out high-precision 
electrical measurements on the as-grown crystals. To increase the electrical resistance of the samples, we 
polished the crystals down to a thin slab along the c-axis (thickness of tens of micrometers). Electrical 
leads were gold wires glued to the crystals using silver epoxy H20E. (2) BaFe2(As1-xPx)2: crystals of 
BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 with doping levels of x = 0.25 and x = 0.50 were grown using the self-flux method42. High-
purity flakes of Ba (99.99%, Aldrich) and powders of FeAs and FeP (homemade from Fe, As, and P, 99.99%,4 
Aldrich) were thoroughly mixed and placed in an Al2O3 crucible, which was then sealed in an evacuated 
quartz tube under vacuum and placed in a Lindberg box furnace. Crystals of plate shapes with lateral 
dimensions up to 2 mm and thicknesses up to 200 µm were obtained by heating up to 1180 ◦C and then 
cooling down to 900 ◦C at a rate 2 ◦C/min. Electrical leads of gold wires with a diameter of 50 µm were 
attached to the crystals using silver epoxy H20E.  (3) InSb: a crystal of 5 mm ´ 5 mm ´ 0.5 mm was 
purchased from the MTI corporation. It was cut into pieces with desired lateral dimensions. Gold pads of 
~100 nm thick were deposited on locations pre-defined using photolithography. Electrical leads were 
fabricated by attaching 50 µm diameter gold wires to the pads with silver epoxy H20E. 
Resistance measurements. We conducted resistance measurements to obtain both Rxx(H) and Rxy(H) 
curves at various fixed temperatures, enabling the calculation of the resistivities rxx(H) = Rxxwd/l and rxy(H) 
= Rxyd, where w, d, and l are the width, thickness of the sample and the separation between the voltage 
contacts, respectively. The magnetic field is applied along the c-axis of the crystals. The magnetoresistance 
is defined as MR = [rxx(H) - r0)]/r0, where rxx(H) and r0 are the resistivities at a fixed temperature with 
and without the presence of a magnetic field, respectively. In some cases, we obtained rxx(T) curves from 
the measured rxx(H) curves at fixed temperatures to avoid nonequilibrium temperature effects. Data for 
TaP and InSb were obtained using the conventional four-probe DC electrical transport measurement 
technique while those for BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 were obtained using a low-frequency lock-in method.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
III.1. Extended Kohler’s rule of magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetal TaP 
TaP is a transition-metal monophosphide considered as the first realization of a Weyl semimetal43-46. 
Figure 1a presents the typical magneto-transport behavior of the longitudinal resistivity, rxx(H), of a TaP 
crystal (sample TP1). Since the temperature dependence of rxx(T) has often exhibited interesting  
magnetoresistance phenomena such as the ‘turn-on’ temperature behavior5,7,8 and topological insulating 
states28-30, we also present rxx(T) curves in Fig.1b.5 
Both rxx(H) and rxx(T) in Fig.1 are consistent with those reported recently in other materials with 
extremely large magnetoresistance5-16,22-32. The magnetoresistance MR can be as high as 105 % at 2 K and 
9 T (Fig.2a), and follows the typical power-law MR ~ Hm behavior with m » 1.6 (dashed line in Fig.2c)27. In 
the absence of a magnetic field, the resistivity decreases monotonically with temperature, as expected 
for a semimetal. When an external magnetic field is applied, the resistivity increases and a remarkable 
‘turn-on’ behavior appears in the rxx(T) curves: the temperature behavior of the resistivity changes from 
metal-like at high temperatures to insulating-like at low temperatures at magnetic fields H = 0.2 T, 0.5 T 
and 1.0 T and become insulating-like over the entire temperature range at higher magnetic fields. 
The key results of this work on TaP are displayed in Fig.2, which presents the violation of Kohler’s 
rule and highlights our extended Kohler’s rule. For clarity, we present in Fig.2a partial MR(H) curves 
derived from the rxx(H) data in Fig.1a while all rxx(T) curves in Fig.1b were used to obtain the MR(T) curves 
in Fig.2d. The respective scaling of MR(H) and MR(T) is presented in Fig.2b and 2e. Clearly, Kohler’s rule 
MR = f(H/r0) is not followed in TaP since the MR curves do not collapse onto a single curve when plotted 
against H/r0. However, all curves in Fig.2b are nearly in parallel with each other, suggesting that a single 
temperature-dependent multiplier to MR (y-axis) or to H/r0 (x-axis) could cause them to overlap or 
collapse onto the same curve. Here we tackle the latter case and uncover the underlying physics. 
For the convenience of the forthcoming discussions we designate 1/nT as the temperature dependent 
multiplier to H/r0 (x-axis) in the MR ~ H/r0 curves in Fig.2b. In practice, we scale all the MR curves to the 
T = 300 K curve [i.e., nT = 1 for MR(300K) ~ (1/nT)(H/r0)] by varying nT for each curve. As shown in Fig.2c, 
all curves in Fig.2b indeed collapse onto the T = 300 K curve when the data are scaled as MR ~ H/(nTr0). 
The nT values for the MR ~ H/r0 curves at various temperatures are presented in Fig.3. It decreases 
monotonically from nT = 1 at T = 300 K to nT = 0.45 at T = 2 K. As presented in Fig.2f, we also accounted for 
the violation of Kohler’s rule in Fig.2e for the MR(T) curves by using the same nT values as those used in 
Fig.2c. We found nearly identical behavior for the second TaP crystal (sample TP2), as demonstrated by6 
the plots of MR ~ H/(nTr0) in Fig.S1, with nT presented in Fig.3. That is, the magnetoresistance of TaP 
follows an extended Kohler’s rule with a thermal factor nT, 
                        MR = f[H/(nTr0)]                                                                 (1) 
In the analysis above we purposely used nT in the denominator to couple with r0 in Eq.1, aiming to 
reveal the possible role of the carrier density in the violation of Kohler’s rule. In a theoretical consideration 
on the violation of Kohler’s rule in the normal-state resistivity of cuprate superconductors, Luo et.al.41 
introduced a MR scaling form (it was called a modified Kohler’s rule), MR = f(Ht), where t  is the relaxation 
time of the carriers, since H and t are coupled together as Ht for MRs in the derived equations. Using r0 
= m*/(ne2t), Ht can be expressed as Ht = (m*/e2)H/(nr0), indicating that a scaling behavior of MR = 
f[H/(nr0)] is expected if m* is temperature independent. However, there is no reliable way to obtain the 
values of n in a semimetal from transport measurements, as demonstrated in Fig.S2 for nH/n in a 
compensated system with ne = nh = n, where nH is the density obtained from Hall effect measurements, 
and in Fig.S3 for electron and hole density derived from a two-band model analysis in TaP. Furthermore, 
m* can change with temperature47. More importantly, materials such as multi-band semimetals where 
violation of Kohler’s rule are reported, go beyond the (isotropic) single-band consideration in MR = f(Ht). 
We reveal in the discussion below that H and the mobility µi = et/mi* (i ³ 1) are interconnected as Hµi in 
the MR expression. Also, it is the temperature-induced change in the carrier density is responsible for the 
violation of Kohler’s rule. Hence, our extended Kohler’s rule expression in Eq.1 provides a unique way to 
reveal the temperature dependence of the carrier density.  
In the normal state of a cuprate superconductor the temperature-induced change in the carrier 
density can be attributed to the existence of a pseudogap or Mott - Wannier excitons of weakly bound 
electrons and holes41. Differing from the linear temperature dependence of the carrier density used to 
explain the violation of Kohler’s rule in cuprate superconductors41, the nT obtained in our samples can be 
approximately described by nT ~ T2 (Fig.S4), which can be attributed to the thermally-induced change in 
the carrier density, as elaborated below.7 
As revealed by bandstructure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) 
experiments43-46, TaP has a total of 12 pairs of Weyl nodes. Four of them, denoted as W1, are enclosed by 
electronlike Fermi surface with energies below the Fermi level. The other eight pairs, denoted as W2, are 
enclosed by holelike Fermi surface and with energies above the Fermi level. The bandstructure is 
illustrated in Fig.3, with the relative locations of W1 and W2 with respect to the Fermi level, EF. Considering 
the temperature dependent Fermi-Dirac distribution, the total density of the conduction electrons at a 
given T can be straightforwardly obtained using:

                                         (2) 
 
 
where i = 1 and 2 correspond to Weyl nodes W1 and W2 with respective energies of 𝐸( = E1 and E2. 𝑔( =
 𝑔=(𝜀) and 𝑔>(𝜀)  are the density of states (DoS) for the conduction bands of W1 and W2, respectively. 
Since equal number of holes are created, Eq.2 can also be used to calculate the thermally-induced change 
in the hole density. In TaP, the density of electron and holes are close to each other (Fig.S3c). We focus 
only on electron density in the following discussions. 
The energies E1 and E2 of the Weyl nodes W1 and W2 in TaP have been determined by bandstructure 
calculations44 and by ARPES measurements45. The theoretical DoS roughly follows 𝑔 ~ 𝜀 at 𝜀 up to ~0.3 eV 
and becomes nearly constant at higher energies44,47. As an estimate we use 𝑔( = 𝑔(?(𝜀−𝐸() for 𝜀≤ 0.3 
eV and 𝑔( = 𝑔(?(0.3 −𝐸() for higher energies. In Fig.S5a we present the calculated n1 and n2 and their 
sum n using the theoretical values of (-53.1 meV, 19.6 meV) for the energies (E1, E2) (relative to the Fermi 
level) of the Weyl nodes W1 and W2 and the electrons and hole densities of ne0 = 4.898´1024 m-3 and nh0 
= 5.317´1024 m-3 at T = 0 K [44]. As indicated by the dashed curve in Fig.3, the total electron density, n, 
normalized to the value at T = 300 K, describes the experimental nT very well. The small deviation can be 
understood with sample-dependent (E1, E2), as demonstrated by the dotted curve obtained using the 
experimental values45 of (-40 meV, 24 meV) and the solid curve calculated with (-46.2 meV, 19.6 meV),8 
i.e., a slight increase in the theoretical E1 value towards the experimental one while keeping the value of 
E2 unchanged.  
The above discussion indicates that the relative position of the Fermi level to the bottom of the 
conduction band and the top of the valence band, i.e., the density of electrons and holes at T = 0 K affects 
the temperature dependence of nT. As presented in Fig.S5b, the temperature-induced change in nT mostly 
comes from the electron band. In Fig.S6a we present nT versus T curves calculated using different values 
of EF in the electron band. It is clear that the sensitivity of nT to T depends strongly on the Fermi level. In 
our TaP samples with EF » 50 meV to the bottom of the conduction band, nT nearly doubles when the 
temperature is increased from T = 2 K to 300 K. However, it becomes challenging to experimentally resolve 
the change in nT in the same temperature range when the Fermi level is increased to 200 meV. In this 
case, nT » 1 and Kohler’s rule should hold within experimental errors. Thus, the Fermi energy, i.e., electron 
density at T = 0 K, plays a key role in Kohler’s rule. It directly explains why Kohler’s rule is violated in type-
I Weyl semimetals while it is upheld in their type-II counterparts since the latter typically have much higher 
electron densities5,6,8. The validity of Kohler’s rule in conventional metals is also not a surprise. They have 
much higher Fermi energies of a few eVs and electron densities of 1028~29 m-3 [48], which is 3~4 orders of 
magnitude higher than that of TaP, making thermally induced changes in the carrier density irrelevant. In 
Fig.S6b we show that the functional form of the DoS 𝑔(𝜀) can further contribute to the nT versus T 
relationship. When the exponent a in g(e) ~ ea changes from a = 1 for TaP to a = 1/2 for typical metals, 
nT becomes less sensitive to the change of T at the same Fermi level. This explains why violation of Kohler’s 
rule is observed more often in topological semimetals than in their trivial counterparts.  
III.2. Extended Kohler’s rule versus other alternative scaling forms of the magnetoresistance 
In addition to topological materials, violations of Kohler’s rule were often reported in cuprates and 
iron-based superconductors as well as other topologically trivial materials and various alternative MR 
scaling forms have been introduced18-20,33-41. Among them, the most common one is  
                                   MR = gHtan2qH  
 
                              (3)9 
where qH = arctan(rxy/rxx) is the Hall angle. This MR scaling behavior was first reported in cuprate 
superconductors, with gH = 1.7 and gH = 1.5-1.7 for underdoped and optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-d, 
respectively, and gH = 13.6 for La2SrxCuO4 [18]. It has numerous explanations18-21,37-41 including the spin-
charge separation scenario of the Luttinger liquid21, current vertex corrections and spin density wave20. 
Below we show that the scaling Eq.3 is a natural outcome of our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 in a 
compensated two-band material when the carrier mobility is very low, with gH being an indicator of the 
ratio of the hole and electron mobility. We also obtain similar scaling forms to Eq.1 and Eq.3 for a low-
mobility single-band system with an anisotropic Fermi surface as well as non-compensated two-band and 
multi-band systems. 
For a compensated two-band system where ne = nh = n, the second term in the denominator of Eq.S1 
is zero, leading to MR = µeµhH2. Hence MR can be re-written as MR = aµ/e2[H/(nr0)]2 where 
aµ = (µh/µe)/(1+µh/µe)2, r0 = [ne(µh+µe)]-1 and ne, nh, µe and µh are the densities and mobilities of electron 
and holes, respectively. Thus, our extended Kohler’s rule presented in Eq.1 is valid if aµ is temperature 
independent. Likewise, the second term in the numerator of Eq.S2 also becomes zero, yielding a linear 
Hall resistivity rxy = H(µh/µe-1)/[en(µh/µe+1)]. Then, MR = µeµhH2 can be alternately expressed as 
MR = gH(rxy/r0)2                                                   
(4) 
with 
 
 
   gH = (µh/µe)/(1-µh/µe)2                                        
(5) 
At very low mobilities, MR® 0 and rxx » r0, resulting in Eq.3 and Eq.4 to be equivalent. That is, in a 
compensated two-band system with very low mobilities, our extended Kohler’s rule in Eq.1 will lead to 
the scaling behavior of Eq.3.  
The same conclusion can be reached for a nearly compensated two-band system, if the mobilities 
and/or the magnetic fields are low, such that the second term in the denominator of both Eq.S1 and Eq.S2 
as well as the second term in the numerator of Eq.S2 become negligible. As revealed in TaP below, aµ is 
indeed temperature insensitive (Fig.5b). Thus, our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 can be expressed as Eq.310 
for a compensated system as well as for a nearly compensated system with very low mobilities and/or at 
very low fields if the mobilities are high. 
Underdoped YBa2Cu3O7-d [49,50] are indeed two-band materials. On the other hand, the optimal-
doped YBa2Cu3O7-d  (with Tc = 90 K) which also shows the scaling behavior akin to Eq.3 is believed to be 
single-band system with an anisotropic Fermi surface41. As detailed in the supplement, a single band 
material would have no magnetoresistance if all carriers moving in the same direction have the same 
mobility. It exhibits magnetoresistance probably due to (1) the mobility distribution of carriers from 
different energy levels near the Fermi surface1 and (2) the existence of impurities. In the first case, we can 
obtain 𝑀𝑅≈𝛼I∗[𝐻/(𝑛𝜌?)]>  (Eq.S10) with 𝛼I∗= 2𝜅/𝑒>[1 + (𝜇Q/𝜇R)>]/[1 + 𝜇Q/𝜇R]> (Eq.S11) at low 
carrier mobilities such that 𝜇S>𝐻> ≪1, where 𝜇R and 𝜇Q represent the highest and lowest mobility of 𝜇S 
along the x-direction and 𝜅 is the ratio (𝜇Y/𝜇S) of the carrier mobilities 𝜇S and 𝜇Y along the x and y 
directions. In the meantime, we can also obtain 𝑀𝑅≈𝛾R

∗= (9/8𝜅)[1 + (𝜇Q/𝜇R)>] [1 −
(𝜇Q/𝜇R)>]>/[1 −(𝜇Q/𝜇R)`]> (Eq.S12). In the latter case, an optimal-doped YBa2Cu3O7-d crystal can be 
considered as a two-band or multiband system, with a dominating intrinsic anisotropic band together with 
one or more impurity bands. At low carrier mobilities, we have  𝑀𝑅= [𝐻/(𝑛7𝜌?)]> (Eq.S15) with 𝑛7 =

YBa2Cu3O7-d but also indicate that our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 should be valid whenever the scaling of 
Eq.3 is observed. 
TaP is a nearly compensated two-band system with high mobilities, as manifested by the large MRs 
(Fig.2a) and non-linear rxy curves (Fig.S7). Thus, the scaling behavior in Eq.3 is expected to fail when the 
MRs become significantly large, as confirmed by the plot in Fig.4a, which shows that Eq.3 is roughly valid 
for MR < 10% and yields a value of gH = 9 at T = 300 K. On the other hand, Eq.4 is an approximate expression11 
of Eq.1 at low magnetic fields and should be valid over a wider field range by avoiding the influence of 
rxx(H) in Eq.3. As plotted in Fig.4b, MR ~ (rxy/r0)2 indeed allows us to more reliably derive the gH values 
(Fig.5a). The corresponding µh/µe changes from 1.39 at T = 300 K to 1.24 at T = 2 K (Fig.5b), leading to a 
nearly temperature-independent aµ with a very small change (< 0.35%) from T = 300 K to T = 2 K (Fig.5b). 
In both Kohler’s theory2 and the derivations by Luo et al.41, Ht  appears as a product that is 
inseparable in the expression for MR = f(Ht) and hence has been proposed as a modified Kohler’s 
rule33,36,41. The magnetoresistances in the normal state of La2-xSrxCuO4 and KxFe2−ySe2 single crystals were 
indeed found to follow the scaling behavior of MR = f(Ht) if t  ~ T-1 [33] and t  ~ T-2 [36] are respectively 
assumed. However, t is not a parameter that can be conveniently obtained from resistivity 
measurements. As discussed in section III.1, MR = f(Ht) does not consider the possible role of the carrier’s 
effective mass and t  should be replaced with µ, which can have more than one value, as demonstrated 
in Eq.S10 and Eq.S11 as well as Eq.S15 and Eq.S16. Thus, its applications are limited, particularly for single 
band systems with temperature independent effective mass. It will usually fail in two-band and multi-
band systems. For example, by assuming single relaxation time 𝜏 for all carriers we can re-write Eq.S15 as 
𝑀𝑅= 𝑓(𝜏e𝐻𝜏)  with 𝜏e = ∑(𝑛(/𝑚(
`)
(
]=/>/ ∑(𝑛(/𝑚()
(
]=/> . Clearly, 𝜏e  will not be a constant when 
𝑛( and 𝑚( are temperature dependent. That is, Eq.1 extends the Kohler’s rule to two-band and multi-band 
systems, as experimentally confirmed by the MR scaling behavior in TaP. These derivations further 
indicate that 𝑛7 represents the temperature dependence of the carrier density in an anisotropic single-
band system (𝑛7 ~ 𝑛, see Eq.S10) as well as in two-band and multi-band systems  (𝑛7 ~ 𝑓g(𝑇), see 
Eq.S16) if the densities/mobilities from different bands have the same or similar temperature 
dependence, i.e.,  𝑛( ≈𝑛(
?𝑓g(𝑇) and 𝜇( ≈𝜇(
?𝑓I(𝑇). In other cases, the thermal factor 𝑛7 in Eq.1 contains 
contributions from the temperature dependences of the carrier densities and mobilities of all bands.

The discussions in the preceding section indicate that Eq. 1, our extended Kohler’s rule applied to 
a semimetal also provides a sensible explanation for the alternative scaling rule presented in Eq.3, which 
has been used routinely to account for the normal-state magnetoresistances in several classes of 
superconductors19-21,33-41. Here, we experimentally confirm the applicability of Eq.1 on two 
superconducting BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 crystals with x = 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. Their corresponding 
superconducting transition temperatures are 31 K and 22 K, as revealed by the temperature dependence 
of the zero-field resistivity presented in Fig.S8. 
In the over-doped crystal with x = 0.5, we found that the magnetoresistance obeys Kohler’s rule 
(Fig.S9c) while the plot of MR versus tan2qH does not collapse the data into a single curve (Fig.S9b). 
However, as indicated by the dashed magenta line, the MR versus tan2qH curves obtained at different 
temperature are indeed linear. The parallel shift in the log-log plot indicates that the prefactor gH in Eq.3 
is temperature dependent (inset of Fig.S9b), similar to that found in TaP (Fig.5a). In the under-doped 
crystal with x = 0.25, we did observe both the violation of Kohler’s rule (Fig.6b) and the validity of the 
scaling Eq.3 (Fig.6c). As indicated in Fig.6c and the gH values in its inset, MR versus tan2qH curves at T ³ 50 
K overlap each other while those at T < 45 K show a slight parallel shift, with an increase of gH from ~7 at 
T = 45 K to ~9 at T = 32 K. In contrast, our extended Kohler’s rule, Eq.1, works well over the entire 
temperature range as shown in Fig.6d. Similar to gH, the derived nT (inset of Fig.6d) also shows a significant 
change in its temperature dependence at T ≈ 50 K. At T ³ 50 K, the temperature dependence of nT is 
roughly linear. Interestingly, it can also be described by nT = n0 + aTe-D/kBT (dashed line in the inset of Fig.6d 
with n0 = 0.7, a = 5.4´10-3, and D = 5.18 meV), analogous to the temperature dependence of the carrier 
density arising from carriers thermally excited over a pseudogap D in cuprates51,52. At T  £ 45 K, nT changes 
with temperature at a much higher rate. The temperature (~50 K) at which nT changes its temperature 
sensitivity is coincident with that of a transition into an antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phase35 (inset of 
Fig.S8 and discussion in its caption). While further investigations are needed to account for the13 
temperature behavior of nT at temperatures above and below ~50 K, the results in Fig.6 demonstrate that 
our extended Kohler’s rule will work when the scaling following Eq.3 is obeyed. This provides experimental 
support for the conclusion in section III.2 that Eq.1 can be expressed as Eq.3 when the mobilities of the 
carriers are low, which can be inferred from the negligible MRs in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (Fig.6, up to 2% at H = 9 
T). Furthermore, the above discussions show that nT can be an indicator of a temperature induced phase 
transition, if it exhibits a sudden change in the temperature sensitivity. 
III.3.2. Extended Kohler’s rule of magnetoresistance in semiconductor InSb 
Following the discussions in section III.1 and III.2, it can be challenging to account for the 
temperature behavior of nT derived from our extended Kohler’s rule of Eq.1 in semimetals and in the 
normal state of a superconductor. In the former case, one needs to know detailed information of the 
semimetal’s electronic bandstructure that can be sample dependent44,45. In the normal state of a 
superconductor, nT can be governed by more than one mechanism besides the electronic bandstructure, 
such as a pseudogap. In order to unambiguously validate the extended Kohler’s rule of Eq.1, we applied 
the scaling to the magnetoresistance of an undoped semiconductor. Kohler’s rule is presumed to be 
violated due to the expected exponential temperature dependence of the intrinsic carrier density ni ~ 
T3/2e-Eg/2kBT with Eg being the band gap48, providing an exemplar system to showcase our extended Kohler’s 
rule Eq.1. Its compensated nature also simplifies the analysis using Eq.S1 and EqS2 of the conventional 
two-band model, as discussed in section III.2. We chose InSb, which is a narrow-gap semiconductor53 with 
resistivities conveniently measurable at around room temperature54. Its temperature dependent band 
gap Eg is available in the literature53, enabling comparisons of the temperature dependence of nT with that 
of the calculated ni and/or of the reported band gap with that derived from nT. Its large MR54 (up to ~103% 
at T > 250 K) implies high carrier mobility, extending the range of the carrier mobility and enabling the 
validation of Eq.4, from which scaling Eq.3 is deduced at low carrier mobility. More importantly, we found 
a very large (> 102) ratio (µe/µh) of the electron (µe) and hole (µh) mobility in InSb, where the carrier density14 
ni is practically same as that (nH) obtained from Hall measurements (Fig.S2 and caption). This allows a 
further verification of nT using the experimentally determined carrier density. 
We present typical rxx(H) curves of InSb around room temperature in Fig.7a. We focused on data 
obtained at T ³ 240 K to avoid interference of quantum magnetoresistance that can occur at lower 
temperatures54 and the contribution to the magnetoresistance by the residual impurity in the nominally 
undoped crystal (Fig.S10 and caption). As expected for a semiconductor, rxx increases with decreasing 
temperature (also Fig.S10a). Figure 7c shows that Kohler’s rule is violated in InSb. In fact, the curves in the 
Kohler’s rule plot are separated from each other even further, compared to those prior to the scaling 
(Fig.7b). This is in contrast to those shown in Fig.2a&2b and in Fig.6a&b for a semimetal (TaP) and for a 
superconductor [BaFe2(As2-xP)2] in the normal state, because their zero-field resistivity r0 has opposite 
temperature dependence to that of the semiconducting InSb. On the other hand, our extended Kohler’s 
rule, Eq.1, can collapse all the data into a single curve (Fig.7d). The temperature dependence of the 
derived nT can be well described theoretically (Fig.S11b), unveiling band gaps comparable to those 
determined from other methods in the literature (inset of Fig.S11b). It is nearly indistinguishable to that 
of the experimental Hall carrier density nH obtained from the rxy(H) curves (Fig.S11a) as well as carrier 
density ni (Fig.S12c) obtained by simultaneous fittings of rxx(H) and rxy(H) curves using the two-band 
model (Fig.S12a). These results evidently prove the validity of our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 in 
semiconducting InSb, further demonstrating its generality. As presented in Fig.7e, a plot of MR versus 
tan2qH can also collapse all data into one common curve, which becomes however nonlinear with 
increasing magnetic field. This indicates that MR is not proportional to tan2qH, i.e., the scaling provided by 
Eq.3 is not valid. The reason is that Eq.3 is deducible from Eq.4 only when the carrier mobility is very low 
so that the magnetoresistance MR is negligible, i.e., rxx(H) » r0. On the other hand, Fig.7f shows that the 
general form Eq.4 does work well in InSb over the entire field range, confirming that in a compensated15 
two-band system, Eq.4, i.e., MR = gH(rxy/r0)2, can be derived from the extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1, 
regardless of the value of the carrier mobility. 
IV. CONCUDING REMARKS 
Since it was proposed more than 80 years ago for orbital magnetoresistances in non-magnetic metals, 
Kohler’s rule has been widely used to account for the magnetoresistance behavior in materials beyond 
simple metals, including cuprate and iron-based superconductors as well as in topological materials. On 
one hand, it offers a phenomenological understanding of novel magnetoresistance phenomena such as 
the ‘turn-on’ temperature behavior of the magnetoresistance in topological materials. On the other hand, 
its violations have been often reported, and attributed to temperature-induced phase transitions or other 
unconventional mechanisms. Stimulated by the widely reported violations of Kohler’s rule in the newly 
discovered topological semimetals, we tackled the ubiquitous thermal induced changes in the carrier 
density. We used a low carrier density, type-I Weyl semimetal, TaP, to establish an extended Kohler’s rule 
(Eq.1), which takes into account the role played by the temperature dependence of the carrier density. 
We demonstrated how the extended Kohler’s rule naturally reduces to the original Kohler’s rule in 
materials such as metals whose carrier density is so high that the temperature induced change in it is 
experimentally indistinguishable. We applied our extended Kohler’s rule to account for other alternative 
scaling forms of magnetoresistance, particularly the widely debated scaling behavior of MR ~ tan2qH 
(Eq.3) discovered in cuprates and often applied to other superconductors. We showed that Eq.3 can be 
deduced from our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 when the carrier mobility is very low. We also conducted 
measurements on the normal-state magnetoresistance in superconductor BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 to demonstrate 
that Eq.1 is valid when the scaling Eq.3 is observed. We further demonstrated the validation and generality 
of the extended Kohler’s rule by investigating the magnetoresistance in a narrow-gap semiconductor, 
InSb, whose carrier density is expected to change strongly with temperature and can be determined both 
theoretically and experimentally.16 
Our extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 offers a fundamental understanding of the violation and validity of 
Kohler’s rule in terms of different temperature-response of the thermal factor nT, with nT = 1 denoting the 
original Kohler’s rule. The results for TaP and InSb evidently show that nT represents the temperature 
dependence of the carrier density, providing an alternative way to reveal information on the electronic 
bandstructure, e.g., Fermi level (in TaP) and band gap (in InSb). On the other hand, our extended Kohler’s 
rule is inconclusive in understanding the temperature dependence of nT in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 which is a multi-
band system and where other mechanisms such as the pseudogap may also contribute to the thermally 
induced change in the carrier density. In general, we expect nT to reflect the temperature dependence of 
the carrier density in (1) single band (or one dominant band) systems and (2) in two-band and multi-band 
materials whose carrier density and mobility in all bands have the same or similar temperature 
dependence, as demonstrated by the experimental results in the two-band systems TaP and InSb as well 
as the derived formulae of the compensated two-band systems and also noncompensated two-band and 
multi-band materials. The temperature behavior of the thermal factor nT depends on that of both carrier 
density and mobility, if a system with two or more bands has different temperature dependences for the 
carrier density and mobility in each band. In this case, detailed information on the carrier densities and 
mobilities of all bands are required to calculate nT, making the comparison of theory and experiments 
more challenging. Further work on more materials is needed to ultimately determine the limitations of 
our extended Kohler’s rule. We note that other mechanisms can also cause violations of Kohler’s rule. This 
work demonstrates that thermal effects on the carrier density and mobility may need to be considered 
before new mechanisms are proposed.

mobility 
We start with the carrier’s equation of motion  𝒗̇ = −𝑒(𝑬+ 𝒗× 𝑯)/𝑚∗−𝒗/𝜏, where 𝑒, 𝒗, 𝑚∗ and 𝜏 
are the charge, velocity, effective mass, and relaxation time of the carrier and 𝑬 and 𝑯 are the electric 
field and magnetic field, respectively48. For a single-band system with an anisotropic Fermi surface in 𝑯 ∥

 𝑣𝒚= (𝜇Y𝐸𝒚+ 𝜇S𝜇Y𝐻𝐸𝒙)/( 1 + 𝜇S𝜇Y𝐻>)

𝜎SY = 𝑛𝑒𝜇S𝜇Y𝐻/(1 + 𝜇S𝜇Y𝐻>) 
For clarity in discussions below we re-write them as 
                                            𝜎SS = 𝑛𝑒𝜇S/(1 + 𝜅𝜇S>𝐻>)                                                    (S3)

(S4) 
𝜎SY = 𝑛𝑒𝜇S>𝐻/(1 + 𝜅𝜇S>𝐻>)                                                 (S5) 
where 𝜅= 𝜇Y/𝜇S.  
Considering the conversions of magnetoresistivities from magnetoconductivities, 𝜌SS = 𝜎YY/(𝜎SS𝜎YY +
𝜎SY
> ) and 𝜌SY = 𝜎SY/(𝜎SS𝜎YY + 𝜎SY
> ), we obtain 𝜌SS = 1/(𝑛𝑒𝜇S) and 𝜌SY = 𝐻/(𝑛𝑒). That is, a single 
band material would have no magnetoresistance if all carriers moving in the same direction have the same 
mobility.  
However, carriers at energy levels near EF also contribute to the conductance1. Thus, the carriers have a 
distribution of 𝑛(𝜇S). Assuming 𝑔=  𝑑𝑛/d𝜇S, we can have: 
𝜎SS = 𝑒€
𝑔𝜇S𝑑𝜇S

where 𝜇R and 𝜇Q are the upper and lower limits of 𝜇S, respectively.  𝑔, 𝜇R and 𝜇Q satisfy the relationship

If the mobility is low such that 𝜇S>𝐻> ≪1, we obtain 𝜎SS ≈(𝜎? −𝑎𝐻>)  and  𝜎YS ≈𝑏𝐻

Since 𝜎SY  ≪𝜎SS at low mobilities, the magnetoresistivities can be expressed as: 
 
 
where 𝜌? = 1/𝜎?  is the zero-field resistivity. From Eq.S6 we can obtain a parabolic magnetoresistance, 
i.e.,  𝑀𝑅 ≈𝑎𝜌?𝐻>, where 𝑀𝑅 = (𝜌SS −𝜌?)/𝜌?. Combing Eq.S6 and Eq.S7 we have

with 𝛾R
∗= 𝑎/(𝜌?𝑏>).  Since 𝜌SS ≈𝜌? at low carrier mobility, Eq.S8 can be expressed as: 
 
Eq.S8 and Eq.S9 indicate that a low-mobility anisotropic single-band system can have similar scaling forms 
as those (Eq.5 and Eq.6) of a two-band system discussed in the text. 
We can also re-write Eq.S6 as: 
 
where 𝛼I∗= 𝑎𝑛>𝜌?
`.  That is, the magnetoresistance of an anisotropic single-band system will follow the 
extended Kohler’s rule Eq.1 if 𝛼I∗ is temperature independent. It may seem to be contradictory to claim 
that 𝛼I∗ (= 𝑎𝑛>𝜌?
` )  has no temperature dependence while 𝑛 can be temperature dependent. As 
demonstrated below, all 𝑛 in 𝛼I∗ get cancelled out because 𝑎 ~ 𝑛 and 𝜌? ~ 1/𝑛.  
As an example, we consider a case that 𝑛 is equally distributed among 𝜇R  ≤𝜇S ≤ 𝜇Q. In this case, 𝑔=
𝑛/(𝜇R −𝜇Q);  𝜌? = 2/[𝑒𝑛(𝜇R + 𝜇Q)]; 𝑎= 𝑒𝑛𝜅(𝜇R
„ − 𝜇Q
„)/[4(𝜇R − 𝜇Q)]; resulting in 
𝛼I∗= 2𝜅/𝑒>[1 + (𝜇Q/𝜇R)>]/[1 + 𝜇Q/𝜇R]>                            (S11) 
 
That is, 𝛼I∗ is indeed temperature independent because 𝜇R and 𝜇Qhave the same temperature behavior 
(if the temperature does not induce a change in the anisotropy). 
Likewise, we obtain a temperature independent 𝛾R
∗: 
𝛾R
∗= (9/8𝜅)[1 + (𝜇Q/𝜇R)>] [1 −(𝜇Q/𝜇R)>]>/[1 −(𝜇Q/𝜇R)`]>                      (S12) 
 
Scaling behavior of magnetoresistance in systems with two or more bands  
In a material with more than one bands, the magnetoconductivities for each band are 𝜎SS
( = 𝑒𝑛(𝜇(/[1 +
(𝜇(𝐻)>] and 𝜎YS
(
= 𝑒𝑛(𝜇(
>𝐻/[1 + (𝜇(𝐻)>], where 𝑛( and 𝜇( are the carrier density and mobility of the ith 
band. The total magnetoconductivities are 𝜎SS = ∑𝜎SS

(
(
. The magnetoresistivities can 
be calculated as 𝜌SS = 𝜎SS/(𝜎SS

> ) and 𝜌YS = 𝜎YS/(𝜎SS
> + 𝜎YS

Here, we derive the scaling behavior of the magnetoresistance MR at  𝜇(𝐻≪1, where 𝜎SS

𝜌SS ≈1/𝜎SS = 1/ ∑{𝑒𝑛(𝜇([1 −(𝜇(𝐻)>]}

From Eq.S13 we have  𝑀𝑅≈[∑a𝑛(𝜇(

𝑀𝑅= [𝐻/(𝑛7𝜌?)]>                               (S15)

𝑛7 = 𝑒[∑(𝑛(𝜇()]`/>/[∑(𝑛(𝜇(

The scalings of Eq.S15 and Eq.16 can be valid at high fields in materials with low mobilities or at low fields 
in those with high mobilities, as long as 𝜇(𝐻≪1.  
Eq.S16 indicates that 𝑛7 represents temperature dependence of the carrier density, i.e., 𝑛7 ~ 𝑓g(𝑇), if  
the densities/mobilities from different bands have the same or similar temperature dependence, i.e.,  
𝑛( ≈𝑛(
?𝑓g(𝑇) and 𝜇( ≈𝜇(

Fig.S2. Carrier density derived from the Hall effect measurements in a compensated two-band 
system. In transport experiments, the Hall effect can be employed to determine the densities of 
carriers in single band materials from the slopes of the linear Hall resistivity 𝜌SY(𝐻) curves. When a 
two-band system is compensated, i.e., 𝑛~ = 𝑛} = 𝑛, Eq.S2 also yields a linear field dependence of 
the Hall resistivity 𝜌SY = 𝐻/(𝑒𝑛R) with 𝑛R = 𝑛|(𝜇}/𝜇~ + 1)/(𝜇}/𝜇~ −1)|. In this case it is possible 
to obtain a carrier density 𝑛R from the Hall resistivity. However, the derived values 𝑛R can deviate 
significantly from the true electron and hole density n in the material, depending on the ratio 
𝜇}/𝜇~ of the electron and hole mobilities 𝜇~ and 𝜇} respectively. For example, 60K YBa2Cu3O7-d, 
La2SrxCuO4, and TaP have the values of  𝜇}/𝜇~= 2.2, 𝜇}/𝜇~= 1.31 and  𝜇}/𝜇~= 1.24-1.39, respectively 
(see discussions in the text), corresponding to 𝑛R/𝑛 = 2.8, 𝑛R/𝑛 = 7.45, and 𝑛R/𝑛 = 6.13-9.33 if they 
are compensated two-band materials. 
These results indicate that 𝑛R determined using 𝜌SY(H) can differ from the true carrier density 𝑛 in 
the material even if 𝜌SY(H) shows a linear relationship.37

Fig.S3. Two-band model analysis of the magnetoresistivities in TaP (sample TP1). (a) and (b) Experimental 
𝜌SS(𝐻) and 𝜌SY(𝐻) and the fits to Eq.S1 and Eq.S2, respectively. Open circles are data taken at T = 300 K 
and lines are fits. (c) and (d) Derived densities and mobilities of the electrons and holes (symbols). The 
derived densities are nearly 6 times larger than the calculated values (lines) from Eq.2.  
Currently, the only method to extract information on the carrier densities in a semimetal is to use the 
two-band model to fit either magnetoresistivities rxx(H) and rxy(H)5,10,13,26 or the converted 
magnetoconductivities sxx(H) [= 𝜌SS/(𝜌SS
> + 𝜌SY
> )] and sxy(H) [= 𝜌SY/(𝜌SS
> + 𝜌SY
> )] (Ref.14). Such an 
analysis with four fitting parameters (the densities and mobilities of electrons and holes ne, nh, µe and µh) 
can result in unexpected outcomes. For example, in materials where Kohler’s rule holds, i.e., nT in Eq.1 
should be close to 1 and insensitive to temperature, the derived carrier densities can double or triple 
when the temperature is increased from 2 K to 300 K14,26. Here we use the measured zero-field resistivity 
r0 to reduce the number of fitting parameters to three, and simultaneously fit both rxx(H) and rxy(H). The 
fitted curves, particularly those to the rxx(H) data, deviate significantly from the experimental data. One 
possible reason is that the two-band model is valid only for an isotropic system and is not suitable to 
describe the magnetoresistivities of TaP that has anisotropic Fermi pockets. Fittings with the two-band 
model yields values of ne and nh that are close to each other and increase with temperature. However, 
they are nearly a factor of 6 larger than the theoretical values. Furthermore, the fittings generate larger 
ne than nh, in contrast to those obtained from bandstructure calculations and Eq.2.38

e1/2. Schematics of the corresponding band structures are shown at the top of each panel, with the 
Fermi level indicated with a dashed red line. The legends in (b) are the same as those in (a). The 
values of nT are derived from Eq.2 and normalized to that at T = 300 K. The Fermi energies are 
relative values from the bottom of the conduction band. For simplicity and also as an estimate we 
used g(e) ~ ea (a = 1/2 and 1) at e  from 0 to ¥ in the calculations, as typically done for free electrons. 
As discussed in the text for TaP, DoS can deviate from g(e) ~ ea at high energies (e.g. e > 300 meV). 
However, the contribution to the total electron density from the high energy levels (e.g. e > 300 
meV in TaP) is negligible (<0.1%).41

the rxx(T) curves in (a) and the bending in the rxy(T) curve in the inset of (b) at temperatures between 
150 K and 175 K are due to a transition from the classical intrinsic state to the impurity dominated 
state, where quantum effects were reported54. The red dashed line in (b) is calculated with nH =

excited over a band gap Eg, i.e., nT ~ T3/2e-Eg/2kBT. The dashed line is derived using Eg = Eg0 +aT2/(b+T) 
with Eg0 = 235.2 meV, a = 0.6 meV /K and b = 500 K from literature53. The solid line is a better fit 
using a = 0.35 while keeping Eg0 and b the same. The inset of (b) shows a comparison of the 
corresponding band gaps.46

Fig.S12. Two-band model analysis of the magnetoresistivities in InSb (sample IS). (a) and (b) Fittings 
of both rxx(H) and rxy(H) curves at T = 300 K simultaneously using Eq.S1 and Eq.S2. We neglected 
the contributions of the impurities at T ³ 240 K and used ne = nh = ni. We also used the measured r0 
value and the relationship of r0 = e(neµe+nhµh) = nie(µe+µh) to reduce the number of fitting 
parameters. This led us to only two free parameters of ni and µe while µh can be calculated from µh 
= r0/nie-µe. (c) and (d) Temperature dependence of the derived parameters of ni, µe and µh. (c) 
indicates that the carrier density ni obtained from the two-band model analysis is indistinguishable 
from the Hall carrier density nH (Fig.S10b). This is consistent with the results in Fig.S2, which showed 
that the Hall carrier density, nH, is equal to the carrier density, ni, at very large ratios of µe/µh (it 
changes slightly from 190 at 360 K to 199 at 240 K for the µe and µh in(d)).
