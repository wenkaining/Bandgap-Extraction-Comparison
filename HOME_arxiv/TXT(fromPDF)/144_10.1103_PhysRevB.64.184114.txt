A ferroelectric monoclinic phase of space group Cm (MA type) has been discovered in
0.65Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.35PbTiO3 by means of high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. It appears at room
temperature in a single crystal previously poled under an electric field of 43 kV/cm applied along the pseudocubic
[001] direction, in the region of the phase diagram around the morphotropic phase boundary between the
rhombohedral (R3m) and the tetragonal (P4mm) phases. The monoclinic phase has lattice parameters a = 5.692
Å, b = 5.679 Å, c = 4.050 Å and β = 90.15°, with the bm-axis oriented along the pseudo-cubic [110]  direction . It
is similar to the monoclinic phase observed in PbZr1-xTixO3 , but different from that recently found in
Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 - PbTiO3, which is of space group Pm (MC type).

I. INTRODUCTION
The complex perovskite Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3
[PMN] exhibits typical relaxor-type ferroelectric
properties which have been intensively studied
for both fundamental and practical reasons.1-3 The
relaxor state is characterized by the frustration of
local polarizations which prevents long-range
ferroelectric order from developing completely.
Although the local symmetry of the polar
domains is rhombohedral, the macroscopic
symmetry of PMN remains cubic below the
temperature 
of 
maximum 
permittivity. 
A
ferroelectric phase can be induced either by
application of an electric field along [111]cub,4 or
by partial substitution of Ti4+ for the complex
(Mg1/3Nb2/3)4+ ions.5 In both cases, the micropolar
domains transform into macro domains with
cubic-to-rhombohedral 
symmetry 
breaking.4,6
With Ti-substitution, a complete solid solution
forms between PMN and PbTiO3, (1-x)PMN-xPT
[PMN-PT], with a morphotropic phase boundary
(MPB) located at x ≈ 0.35, which has hitherto
been believed to represent the frontier between
the rhombohedral (relaxor side) and tetragonal
(ferroelectric side) phases,5 as illustrated in
Figure 1.
Single crystals of PMN–PT and other
relaxor–PT 
solid 
solutions, 
namely
Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 
– 
PT 
[PZN-PT], 
with
compositions near the respective MPB’s, have
been reported to exhibit very high piezoelectric
coefficients (d33 > 2,500 pC/N), extremely large
piezoelectric strains (>1.7 %), and very high
electromechanical coupling factors (k33 > 92 %).7-
11 Such excellent properties point to a potential
revolution in electromechanical transduction for a
broad range of applications. From the crystal
chemistry viewpoint, the strong piezoelectric
response of those materials is associated with the
MPB, and very recently, intensive theoretical and
experimental research has been undertaken in
order to understand the origin of these enhanced
piezoelectric 
properties. 
The 
experimental
breakthroughs have been achieved by the
discovery of new ferroelectric monoclinic and
orthorhombic 
phases 
by 
high-resolution
synchrotron X-ray  diffraction. In PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3
[PZT48], a monoclinic phase with space group
Cm (of MA type, in the Vanderbilt and Cohen
notation12) was found below room temperature.
In such a phase, the monoclinic b-axis lies along
pseudocubic [1 1 0], and the polarization is in the
(1 1 0) plane.13,14 In the PZN–PT system, an
orthorhombic phase was found to exist between
the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases at
around 10%PT.15 Upon application of an electric
field along [001]cub, evidence of polarization2
rotation via a monoclinic phase has been shown
for PZN-8%PT,16 which is in agreement with the
theoretical considerations by first principles
calculations for the PZT case.17, 18  
So far, several pictures of the phase states
near the MPB of the PMN–PT system have been
proposed. Shrout et al 5 initially suggested that
the rhombohedral R3m phase of smaller Ti-
concentration and the tetragonal P4mm phase of
higher Ti-content, were separated by a fairly
sharp phase boundary at 35%PT. Noblanc et al 19
reported a large composition range around MPB
in which the rhombohedral and the tetragonal
phases coexist. Optical domain studies showed
that the R3m and P4mm phases may coexist at
room temperature, with transformation from the
R3m into the P4mm phase taking place over a
wide temperature interval.6  In the present paper,
we report the results of a high-resolution
synchrotron 
X-ray 
diffraction 
study 
of
0.65Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.35PbTiO3 
[PMN-
35%PT] single crystals, showing unambiguous
evidence of a monoclinic phase, which is stable
between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases
near the MPB.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Single crystals of PMN-35%PT were grown
from a high temperature solution using an
optimum flux composition (50wt%PMNT +
49wt%PbO + 1wt%B2O3).20 Two platelets, #1, 65
µm thick,  and #2, 165 µm thick, were cut parallel
to the reference (001)cub plane and polished with
fine diamond paste (down to 1 µm). The (001)cub
faces were covered with Ag-paste, Au-wires were
attached and the platelets #1 and #2 were poled
under an electric field of 43 and 5 kV/cm,
respectively, which was applied along [001]cub at
200 °C (above TC) and maintained while cooling
down to room temperature. The samples were
then short-circuited for 30 min. before the
electrodes were removed. Synchrotron X-ray
diffraction experiments were performed at the
Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source
(NSLS). The PMN-35%PT crystal #1 poled at 43
kV/cm was studied at beam line X22A with 30
keV X-rays from the third order reflection of a
Si(111) monochromator. The measurements were
made on a Huber four-circle diffractometer
equipped with a Si(111) analyzer. X-ray powder
diffraction was also performed on PMN-35%PT
at beam line X7A with 18 keV X-rays from a
Si(111) double-crystal monochromator (λ ≈ 0.7
Å). The PMN-PT crystal #2, previously poled at
5kV/cm, was crushed and sieved to produce a
powder sample with large crystallites (38 – 44
µm), that we call a properly arranged single
crystal (PASC), in order to obtain sharp powder
lines free from sample-broadening effects. A 0.2
mm capillary loaded with the specimen was
mounted on a Huber diffractometer equipped
with 
a 
Ge(220) 
analyzer. 
The 
resulting
instrumental resolution is about 0.005° on the 2θ
scale. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 gives three examples of the
contour maps observed in different cubic zones
around the (002), (300) and (330) reflection peaks
for the PMN-35%PT crystal #1. For these
experiments, the Bragg indices H=K=L=1 were

defined to correspond to the cubic lattice
parameters a = b = c = 4.016 Å for all the cases.
To interpret the diffraction patterns
observed in Figure 2 and to illustrate the structure
of the PMN-35%PT, we need to consider the
possible 
domain 
configurations 
based 
on
group/subgroup symmetry relationship. The high
temperature prototype phase has a Pm3m space
group symmetry. The phase transitions into a
rhombohedral R3m phase, or  a monoclinic m
phase would normally result in eight or twenty-
four (fully) ferroelectric / (partially) ferroelastic
domain 
states, 
respectively.21 
The 
domain
structures 
are 
therefore 
very 
complicated,
especially for the monoclinic phase. However, a
much-simplified situation is produced by electric
field poling, which constrains the c-axis to lie
along the pseudo-cubic [001] direction, analogous
to the situation previously discussed for PZN-
8%PT.16 The monoclinic domain configuration
now consists of two b-domains related by a 90°-
rotation around the c-axis, each of which contains
two domains.
The contour map of Fig. 2(a) shows a
single d-spacing in the H0L zone measured
around the (002) reflection, which gives the
parameter c = 4.050 Å. The fact that a single d-
spacing was observed in this region demonstrates
that the c-axis is indeed fixed along the poling
field direction of pseudocubic [001], and that the
poled state remains stable after the field is
removed. The very weak extra peaks observed  in
the transverse direction may correspond to
slightly-misaligned regions close to the surface,
since they were not observed with high-energy X-
rays at 67 keV. Fig. 2(b) is the contour map
obtained around the pseudocubic (300) peak in
the H0L zone, and shows a symmetrical splitting
along the transverse L direction. This splitting
can be attributed to the two a-domains, but it is in
sharp contrast to the three peaks observed for the
(200) reflection from PZN-8%PT,15 which has
monoclinic symmetry of type MC (in the
Vanderbilt and Cohen notation 12).  On  the  other
hand, the contour map around the pseudocubic
(330) reflection shown in Fig. 2(c) is seen to
contain three peaks, and in conjunction with Fig.
2(b) provides the signature of a monoclinic
structure of MA type with am and bm directed
along pseudocubic [ 1 1 0] and  [1 1 0]. The split
peak is located at  H = K = 2.993 and the single
peak at H = K = 3.000, corresponding to lattice
parameters am = 5.692Å  and bm = 5.679Å. The
transverse separation of the split peaks is L =
0.022, yielding a monoclinic angle β = 90.15°.
The projection of the monoclinic angle (β′ ≈ β√2)
can  also  be  deduced   independently   from   the
FIG. 2 Contour maps observed around
(002), (300) and (330) reflection peaks in the
cubic H0L (a), H0L (b) and HHL (c) zones,
respectively, for a poled PMN-35%PT
crystal. H=K=L=1 has been defined to
correspond to d = 4.016 Å for all the cases.4

splitting of the (300) peak in Fig. 2(b), namely, L
= 0.012, which yields a similar value of 90.16°.
Finally, we note that although a rhombohedral
domain structure could also give qualitatively
similar features, such a structure can immediately
be 
excluded, 
since 
the 
requirements 
of
rhombohedral 
symmetry 
would 
impose
constraints on the lattice parameters [e.g. cm
2 =
(am
2 + bm
2 )/4] which are clearly not satisfied.
Thus we conclude that a monoclinic phase of MA
type has been unambiguously shown to exist in
the PMN-35%PT crystal. Figure 3 shows
longitudinal and transverse linear scans for each
of the (002), (300) and (330) reflections in Fig. 2.
The lines are fits to Gaussian profiles. These
scans confirm the monoclinic symmetry and
lattice parameters deduced above.    
We have also studied the weakly poled
(E<5 kV/cm) PMN-35%PT crystal (#2) in the
form of crushed (PASC) powders by X-ray
powder diffraction at X7A. Figure 4 shows the
sharp powder lines from a PASC sample with
grain size between 38 and 44 µm. Only a single5
peak was observed for the (100)cub reflection,
while both (110)cub and (111)cub reflections
showed split doublets. These patterns can be
clearly indexed as a single rhombohedral R phase
with a = 4.023 Å, α = 89.88 °. Therefore, unpoled
or weakly poled PMN-35%PT samples show an
average rhombohedral phase, consistent with the
reported MPB phase diagram.5
IV. CONCLUSIONS
A monoclinic phase of space group Cm
(MA type) has been discovered in a PMN-35%PT
crystal at room temperature by means of high-
resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This MA
phase has its monoclinic am- and bm-axes oriented
along pseudo-cubic [1 1 0] and [110] directions,
respectively, with the cm-axis along pseudocubic
[001]. The unit cell parameters are found to be am
(≈ ac • 2 ) = 5.692 Å, bm (≈ ac • 2 ) = 5.679 Å, cm
(≈ ac) = 4.050 Å and β = 90.15°. This monoclinic
phase  exhibits the same crystallographic features
as the one reported for PbZr1-xTixO3 (i.e. a
doubled cell rotated by 45° around the c-axis with
respect to the tetragonal unit cell),13 but is
different from the MC –type monoclinic phase
(space group Pm) recently reported in PZN-
8%PT, where the monoclinic bm-axis lies along
[0 1 0]cub.15
The monoclinic phase appears at room
temperature in a PMN-35%PT crystal previously
poled under an electric field of 43 kV/cm applied
along [001]cub. On the other hand, unpoled and
weakly-poled PMN-35%PT samples exhibit an
average   rhombohedral   symmetry.      Although
poling at high-field along [001]cub may be
necessary in order to produce a long-range
monoclinic phase for the composition, this point
is not yet fully settled and we hope to clarify it in
future experiments. The existence 
of 
the
monoclinic phase in PMN-35%PT allows us to
construct an updated phase diagram for the PMN-
PT solid solution system, in which a narrow
monoclinic phase region exists between the
rhomboheral R3m and the tetragonal P4mm
phases at low temperatures, as indicated by the
dashed area in Figure 1. More extended work is
underway 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
a 
better
understanding of the nature of the MPB and the
origin 
of 
the 
outstanding 
piezoelectric
performance of PMN-PT crystals, and will be
reported elsewhere.
 After the submission of the manuscript, two
important papers have appeared: Xu et al.22
reported the observation of monoclinic domains
by polarized light microscopy, and Lu et al.23
showed the existence of an orthorhombic phase in
0.67PMN – 0.33PT crystals.
