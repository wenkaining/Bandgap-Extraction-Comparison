We present Raman spectroscopy measurements on single- and few-layer graphene ﬂakes. Using
a scanning confocal approach we collect spectral data with spatial resolution, which allows us to
directly compare Raman images with scanning force micrographs.
Single-layer graphene can be
distinguished from double- and few-layer by the width of the D’ line: the single peak for single-layer
graphene splits into diﬀerent peaks for the double-layer. These ﬁndings are explained using the
double-resonant Raman model based on ab-initio calculations of the electronic structure and of the
phonon dispersion. We investigate the D line intensity and ﬁnd no defects within the ﬂake. A ﬁnite
D line response originating from the edges can be attributed either to defects or to the breakdown
of translational symmetry.

The interest in graphite has been revived in the last
two decades with the advent of fullerenes1 and carbon
nanotubes.2 However, only recently single- and few-layer
graphene could be transferred to a substrate.3 Transport
measurements revealed a highly-tunable two-dimensional
electron/hole gas of relativistic Dirac Fermions embed-
ded in a solid-state environment.4,5 Going to few-layer
graphene, however, disturbs this unique system in such
a way that the usual parabolic energy dispersion is re-
covered. The large structural anisotropy makes few-layer
graphene therefore a promising candidate to study the
rich physics at the crossover from bulk to purely two-
dimensional systems.
Turning on the weak interlayer
coupling while stacking a second layer onto a graphene
sheet leads to a branching of the electronic bands and
the phonon dispersion at the K point. Double-resonant
Raman scattering6 which depends on electronic and vi-
brational properties turns out to be an ingenious tool to
probe the lifting of that speciﬁc degeneracy.
We report on Raman mapping of single- and few-layer
graphene ﬂakes resting on a silicon oxide substrate. Lat-
eral resolution of 400 nm allows to address neighboring
sections with various layers of graphene down to a sin-
gle graphene sheet, previously determined with the scan-
ning force microscope (SFM). We ﬁnd that the integrated
G line signal is directly correlated with the thickness of
the graphitic ﬂake and is shifted upward in frequency
for double- and single-layer graphene compared to bulk
graphite. The mapping of the peak width of the D’ line
shows a strong contrast between single- and few-layer
graphene.
Such a pronounced sensitivity to the tran-
sition to the very last layer oﬀers an optical and non-
destructive method to unambiguously detect single-layer
graphene. In addition, we locally resolve the structural
quality of the ﬂake by investigating the D band, which
is related to elastic backscattering. The map of the in-
tegrated D line signal of a graphitic ﬂake with double-
and single-layer sections shows that the inner part of
the ﬂake is quasi defect free, whereas edges and steps
serves as scatterers. Finally, we explain the splitting of
the D’ line as a function of the number of graphene layers
within the double-resonant Raman model.6 The compar-
ison between experimental data and theory conﬁrms the
qualitative validity of the double-resonant Raman model,
but demonstrates quantitative diﬀerences between theory
and experiment. In particular, the model, when based
on ﬁrst-principles calculations, predicts a much smaller
splitting of the peaks.
The graphite ﬁlms were prepared by mechanical ex-
foliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)
and subsequent transfer to a highly doped Si waver with
300 nm SiO2 (atomic oxidation process) cap layer.3,7 The
combination of optical microscopy using phase contrast
and SFM makes it possible to locate ﬂakes with various
thicknesses down to a monolayer with lateral extensions
in the micrometer range. The Raman spectra were ac-
quired using a laser excitation of 532 nm (2.33 eV) deliv-
ered through a single-mode optical ﬁber, whose spot size
is limited by diﬀraction. Using a long working distance
focusing lens with a numerical aperture NA=0.80 we ob-
tain a spot size of about 400 nm. With a very low incident
power of 4-7 µW heating eﬀects can be neglected.
The Raman spectrum of graphite has four prominent
peaks (Fig. 3 - for a recent review see Ref. 8). The peak
around 1582 cm−1, commonly called G line, is caused by
the Raman active E2g phonon, (in-plane optical mode)2

close to the Γ point.
The D line around 1350 cm−1
exhibits two remarkable features: its position shifts to
higher frequencies with increasing incident laser excita-
tion energies9 and its relative signal strength (compared
to the G line) depends strongly on the amount of disorder
in the graphitic material.9,10 The associated overtone D’
around 2700 cm−1 is pronounced even in the absence of a
D signal. Finally, the overtone of the G line, the G’ line,
is located at 3248 cm−1, which is more than twice the
energy of the G line. The diﬀerent experimental ﬁndings
related to the dispersive D, D’ bands could be explained
by Thomsen and Reich within the framework of double
resonant Raman scattering,6 which was extended to other
phonon branches by Saito et al.11 The electronic and vi-
brational properties of graphite are dominated by the
sp2-nature of the strong intraplane covalent bonds. The
relatively weak inter-layer coupling causes the high struc-
tural anisotropy. Raman spectra for multiple graphene
layers can be compared qualitatively and quantitatively
while investigating ﬂakes with sections of various thick-
nesses. In Fig. 1(a) the SFM micrograph of a graphite
ﬂake with diﬀerent layers is presented: The bare SiO2 (in-
dicated by ’0’) is surrounded by single-layer sections with
steps of up to two, six and four layers. The diﬀerent step
heights are clearly depicted in Fig. 1(b), where a cross
section of Fig. 1(a) (see white dashed arrow) is shown.

spectral data for spatially resolved data point and con-
struct false-color 2D plots. In Fig. 1(c) the intensity of
the G peak is integrated from 1537 to 1622 cm−1. We ﬁnd
a remarkable correlation with the SFM graph: Brighter
regions correspond to thicker sections. The cross section
in Fig. 1(d) shows a step-like behavior, perfectly corre-
lated with the topographical changes shown in Fig. 1(b).
In Fig. 1(e) we plot the FWHM (full width at half max-
imum) of the D’ line.
It shows the narrowing at the
transition to a single-layer (see e.g. Fig. 3) and gives an
evident contrast between single- and few-layer graphene
sections. The quasi digital change from about 60 to 30
cm−1 shown in Fig. 1(f) suggests that the width of the
D’ line can be used as a detector for single-layer graphene
resting on a substrate. Raman spectroscopy can therefore
be used to count the layers of a thin graphite stack and to
discriminate between single and double layer. Combined
with the double-resonant Raman scattering mechanism
an optical setup using light in the visible range turns out
to be an alternative to scanning force microscopy, which
requires stacking folds as height references.

ﬁnite graphitic ﬂakes on the silicon oxide matrix obtained
with the technique explained above is remarkable: elec-
tronic mobilities up to 15’000 cm2(Vs)−1 were estimated
from transport experiments.4,5 We point out that also the
Raman spectroscopy reveals quasi defect free graphitic
sheets via the absence of a D band signal. First exper-
iments have related the intensity of the D band to the
structural coherence of the graphite material. In fact it is
inversely proportional to the crystallite grain size.10 The
appearance of the D band can, however, be related to the
occurrence of defects and disorder in general, as shown in
experiments with boron-doped and electrochemically ox-
idized HOPG.12 With micro-Raman mapping we are able
to localize the spatial origin of the defects. From cross-
correlating the SFM micrograph in Fig. 2(a) with the
Raman map of the integrated D line (1300-1383 cm−1)
intensity in Fig. 2(c) we infer directly that the edges of
the ﬂake and also the borderline between sections of dif-
ferent height contribute to the D band signal whereas the
inner parts of the ﬂakes do not. This is somewhat sur-
prising since for thinner ﬂakes the inﬂuence of a nearby
substrate on the structural quality should be increasingly
important. In the cross-section Fig. 2(d) we see clearly
that the D line intensity is maximal at the section bound-
aries, which can be assigned to translational symmetry
breaking or to defects. However, we want to emphasize
that the D line is still one order of magnitude smaller
than the G line. In Fig. 2(e) spatially averaged D mode
spectra from the two steps shown in Fig. 2(d) are pre-
sented. The frequency ﬁts well into the linear dispersion
relation of peak shift and excitation energy found in ear-
lier experiments.9 In addition, we ﬁnd that the peak is
narrower and down-shifted at the edge of the single-layer
while it is somewhat broader and displays a shoulder at
the crossover from the double to the single layer.
In Fig. 3(a) and (b), we compare the Raman spec-
tra of the double- and single-layer graphene shown in
Fig. 2(b) and labeled with A and B. The Raman signal
is signiﬁcantly altered when peeling oﬀthe penultimate
layer: the G peak decreases strongly in intensity and
shifts towards higher wave numbers. In connection with
Fig. 1(b) we already stated that the integrated G line

signal is monotonously increasing with increasing ﬂake
thickness. In order to compare data of diﬀerent ﬂakes
and measurement runs we turn our attention to the ratio
of the integrated intensities of the G and D’ line, plotted
in Fig. 4(a). Most of the changes can be attributed to the
decrease of the G line, since the spectral weight of the D’
band changes only slightly. The intensity ratio increases
almost linearly from one to four layers. In Fig. 4(b) the
dependence of the G peak position on the layer number
is investigated. Spectral data of various sections on dif-
ferent ﬂakes were averaged. The frequency shifts towards
higher wave numbers at the crossover to the double- and
especially to the single-layer graphene. However, in the
case of single-layer graphene, it is accompanied by an im-
portant statistical spread of the collected data. In Fig.
4(c) representative G peak spectra for single-, double-
layer graphene and HOPG are presented. It is important
to note that in contrast to the G line, the corresponding
overtone band, the G’ line, does not change its spectral
position as a function of the number of layers.
The most prominent diﬀerence in the spectra of single-
layer, few-layer, and bulk graphite lies in the D’ line: the
integrated intensity of the D’ line stays almost constant,
even though it narrows to a single peak at lower wave
number at the crossover to a single layer (Fig. 3). The
width of the D’ peak or - at high resolution - its splitting
into diﬀerent sub-peaks (Fig. 5) is in the following ex-
plained in the framework of the double-resonant Raman
model.6 The model explains the D’ line in the following
way (see Fig. 6(a)): An electron is vertically excited from
point A in the π band to point B in the π∗band by ab-
sorbing a photon.
The excited electron is inelastically
scattered to point C by emission of a phonon with mo-
mentum q. Since the energy of this phonon (≈150 meV)
is small compared with the photon energy of 2.33 eV, we
have drawn the line horizontally, for simplicity. Inelastic
backscattering to the vicinity of point A by emission of
another phonon with momentum ≈q and electron-hole
recombination lead to emission of a photon with an en-
ergy about 300 meV less than the energy of the incident
photon. In principle, two other double-resonant Raman4

processes, involving the phonons q′ and q′′, are possible
as well.
However, it was argued in Ref. 13 that their
weight is very low.14
In Fig. 6, we compare the electronic band structure of
the single layer with the ones of the double layer and of
bulk graphite. All three dispersion relations were calcu-
lated from ﬁrst-principles, using density-functional the-
ory in the local density approximation.15 In the double-
layer, the π and π∗bands split into two bands each. This
gives rise to four diﬀerent possible excitations. We have
calculated the corresponding oscillator strengths16 and
found that for the excitation energy of 2.33 eV, tran-
sitions 1–3 and 2–4 have negligible weight, while tran-
sitions 1–4 and 2–3 (displayed in Fig. 6(b)) have almost
equal weight. For each of the two dominant vertical tran-
sitions, there are two possible horizontal transitions. The
corresponding electron-phonon coupling matrix elements
for the phonons q0 to q3 are almost equal.17 In theory,
we therefore expect a splitting of the D’ band into four
peaks of almost equal height.
Our experimental data
(Fig. 5) shows indeed that the D’ line for the double layer
can be decomposed into four peaks. However, the outer
two peaks (corresponding to the phonons q0 and q3) have
very low weight in the experimental data. We calculated

corresponding to the momenta q1 and q2. The frequen-
cies of the highest optical branch are given in Table I.
Due to the weak inter-layer coupling the degeneracy of
this branch is lifted. However, the frequency diﬀerence
remains weak (< 1 cm−1) and does not signiﬁcantly con-
tribute to the experimentally observed splitting about 19
cm−1 of the D’ line (see Fig. 5). Table I furthermore gives
the value for 2(ν2 −ν1). We note that the value obtained
from our ﬁrst-principles calculation is only half as large as
the experimentally observed splitting of about 19 cm−1.
This discrepancy is related to the fact, that the double-
resonant Raman model based on ab-initio calculations
also predicts a value for the dispersion of the D’ line with
incident laser energy that amounts only to about half
of the experimentally observed value of 99 cm−1/eV.18
We conclude therefore that the double-resonant Raman
model can qualitatively explain the fourfold splitting of
the D’ line in the double-layer, but the amount of the
splitting and the relative heights of the peaks are not5

properly described within this model.19
In bulk graphite, the π and π∗bands split into a con-
tinuum of bands, i.e., they disperse in the direction kz
perpendicular to the layer. In Fig. 6(c), we display the
bands for three diﬀerent values of kz. In the joint-density
of states, the vertical transitions for kz = 0 have the
dominant weight and are thus considered in our calcu-
lations. Since the splitting between the bands is much
more pronounced than for the double-layer, the value for
2(ν2 −ν1) is about a factor of two higher than for the
double layer. This is in agreement with the experimen-
tal data, see Fig. 5, where the splitting increases likewise
by about a factor of two between the double layer and
bulk graphite. As in the case of the double layer, there
are quantitative diﬀerences between theory and experi-
ment for graphite as well: First-principles calculations
of the oscillator strengths and of electron-phonon cou-
pling matrix elements predict an almost equal height of
the peaks whereas the experiment shows that the lower-
frequency peak has a strongly reduced weight. The peaks
corresponding to the horizontal transitions q0 and q3 are
missing altogether in the experimental spectrum.
Even though some quantitative diﬀerences remain, the
double-resonant Raman model explains well the observed
diﬀerences in the D’ line as we go from the single-layer via
few-layer systems to the bulk limit. The quantitative dif-
ferences may be an indicator that some essential eﬀects
are not properly included in the model. E.g., the role
of quasi-particle eﬀects (electron-electron interaction)20
and of excitonic eﬀects (electron-hole interaction) in the
double-resonance process remains to be understood. The
importance of these eﬀects has been recently demon-
strated for electronic excitations in carbon nanotubes
(both semiconducting and metallic).21,22 A similar im-
portance may be therefore expected for processes that
involve electronic excitations in graphite.23
In conclusion, Raman mapping reveals to be a pow-
erful tool to investigate single- and few-layer graphene
ﬂakes. It turns out that the width of the D’ line is highly
sensitive to the crossover from single- to double-layer
graphene, which is explained by a peak splitting follow-
ing the double-resonant Raman model together with ab
initio electronic band structure calculations. A remain-
ing open question is the decrease of the G line intensity
with decreasing layer number compared to the almost
constant spectral weight of the D’ line and the accompa-
nied upshift of its frequency for double- and single-layer
graphene. The structural quality of the ﬂakes is studied
by analyzing the D line intensity: no defects are detected
in the inner part of the ﬂake. The D line signal from the
boundaries of the individual sections of the ﬂake suggest
that they act as elastic scatterer.

14 The process involving q′ (a phonon very close to the K-
point) does not occur because the corresponding electron-
phonon coupling matrix element is approximately 0 (see
footnote [24] of Ref. 24). And the process involving q′′
has a low weight because due to the “trigonal warping”
eﬀect, the corresponding phase space volume in the two-
dimensional Brillouin zone is small compared to the phase
space volume for process involving q.

18 We note that Ferrari et al.13 overcome this diﬃculty by
using the semiempirical parameter dω/dq (caption of Ta-

persion of the D’ peak. We have avoided the use of this
semiempirical parameter in order to assess the quantita-
tive validity of the double-resonant Raman model based on
ﬁrst-principles calculations. The good agreement between
experimental and theoretical D peak dispersion in Ref. 6
is based on a corresponding ﬁt of the hopping parameter
in the tight-binding band-structure.

an integration in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone for
all transitions of energy ∆E = 2.33 eV would have to be

23 We note that the picture of independent electron-hole pair
excitations has been quantitatively very successful for the
assignment of nanotube spectra to the chiral indices (m,n).
However, this success was based on the use of tight-binding
band-structures with correspondingly ﬁtted parameters.
A parameter-free, ﬁrst-principles, calculation of the opti-
cal spectra of carbon nanotubes must take into account
electron-electron and electron-hole interaction, and we sug-
gest that this may be true for graphite as well.
