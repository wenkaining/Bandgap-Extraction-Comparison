Abstract
Shear to longitudinal mode conversion via second harmonic generation is studied theoretically and com-
putationally for plane waves in a two-dimensional, adhesive, hexagonally close-packed microscale granular
medium. The model includes translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as well as normal and shear
contact interactions. We consider fundamental frequency plane waves in all three linear modes, which have
inﬁnite spatial extent and travel in one of the high-symmetry crystal directions.
The generated second
harmonic waves are longitudinal for all cases. For the lower transverse-rotational mode, an analytical ex-
pression for the second harmonic amplitude, which is derived using a successive approximations approach,
reveals the presence of particular resonant and antiresonant wave numbers, the latter of which is prohibited
if rotations are not included in the model. By simulating a lattice with adhesive contact force laws, we study
the eﬀectiveness of the theoretical analysis for non-resonant, resonant, and antiresonant cases. This work
is suitable for the analysis of microscale and statically compressed macroscale granular media, and should
inspire future studies on nonlinear two- and three-dimensional granular systems in which interparticle shear
coupling and particle rotations play a signiﬁcant role.
1. Introduction
Granular media are known to exhibit complex dynamical behavior that stems from their discrete, often
heterogeneous, structure and highly nonlinear particulate interactions [1, 2, 3].
Ordered and reduced-
dimensional granular systems, often referred to as “granular crystals,” have been a setting of interest for
several decades, as they have yielded new, broader understanding of granular media dynamics [3].
In
addition, utilization of the nonlinear particulate interactions in conjunction with classical linear eﬀects such
as dispersion induced by structural periodicity has resulted in granular crystals being used in new strategies
for passive wave tailoring [4, 5].
Models used to describe granular crystals are typically composed of one- to three-dimensional (1D and
3D, respectively) systems of rigid bodies interacting via Hertzian normal contact “springs” [6, 7].
For
example, this approach has been used in previous studies to explore highly nonlinear mechanical wave
propagation in uncompressed two-dimensional (2D) granular crystals [3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. While this type
of model works well for uncompressed granular media, interparticle shear interactions and particle rotations
become increasingly important in statically compressed granular systems. Several recent theoretical works,
based on earlier discrete lattice models of elastic media [13], have introduced linear models of two- [14, 15]
and three-dimensional [16] granular crystals that account for interparticle shear interactions and particle
rotations. These studies demonstrated how the additional degrees of freedom and modes of particle coupling
can drastically inﬂuence the granular crystal dynamics, and yield unique eﬀects such as the rotational waves
experimentally observed in statically compressed macroscale granular systems [17]. Shear interactions and
particle rotations also play a similarly important role in the emerging ﬁeld of microscale granular crystals,
as has been demonstrated in recent theoretical [18] and experimental [19] studies of quasi-1D microgranular
systems in linear dynamical regimes.
In this work, we explore the nonlinear phenomena of second harmonic (SH) generation for plane waves
traveling in a model of a 2D hexagonally-close packed lattice of microspheres, which includes interparticle

known phenomenon that has been studied extensively in nonlinear optics [20] and acoustics [21].
Past
works have also examined SH generation in 1D discrete granular chains [22, 23] and ﬂuid-saturated granular
media [24]. Using a successive approximations approach in the manner of Refs. [22, 23], we theoretically
analyze the SH generation for cases where the fundamental frequency (FF) wave is purely longitudinal (L)
or transverse-rotational (TR) in character, and ﬁnd that the generated SH waves are longitudinal in both
scenarios. Such shear-to-longitudinal mode conversion via SH generation has been previously studied in
nonlinear elastic solids [25], observed experimentally in 3D granular packings [26], and modeled in quasi-1D
nonlinear phononic crystals [27]. We show that the SH generated by a FF wave in the lower TR mode may
resonate or vanish for particular wavelengths, but the latter phenomenon is not predicted if rotations are
excluded from the model. Finally, we compare our theoretical predictions with dynamic discrete-element
simulations of a microscale granular crystal. We ﬁnd that the theoretical predictions are quantitatively
accurate for non-resonant wavelengths, and provide qualitative understanding of the behavior at resonance.
This paper extends the already rich body of work on nonlinear waves in 2- and 3D ordered granular media
by exploring the interplay of multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinear particulate interactions.

We consider a 2D, hexagonally close-packed lattice of spheres, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The interactions be-
tween spheres follow the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) adhesion model [28, 29], which includes Hertzian
normal contact forces [6, 7], and a static adhesive force FDMT = 2πwRc due to van der Waals interactions,
where w is the work of adhesion [29], Rc = R/2 is the eﬀective radius for two spheres in contact, and R is
the microsphere radius. To describe the shear contact interactions, we use the Hertz-Mindlin model [7, 30],
assuming no slip occurs in the contact surface. Because the characteristic sound speeds of waves in the
lattice are much slower than those of the bulk material of the spheres, we treat the spheres as rigid bodies
with radius R, mass m, and moment of inertia I = (2/5)mR2, interacting via nonlinear spring elements
[3]. In terms of the displacements uj,k, vj,k, and θj,k, which represent horizontal, vertical, and angular
2displacements from equilibrium, respectively, the equations of motion of the sphere with index (j, k) are
given by

We restrict our analysis to plane waves traveling in the positive y direction; hence, the equations of
motion take the form of an eﬀective 1D lattice with three degrees of freedom, and we adopt the single
index n. We also transform the system to dimensionless variables p = v/D0, q = −u/D0, φ = Rθ/D0, and
τ = t/(
p
2m/(g1 + 3k1)), where D0 is a characteristic displacement amplitude. Finally, the equations of
motion are reduced to a simpler form, which is valid for small nonlinearity (ϵ << 1):

In all numerical results that follow, we use, as a case study, the geometric and material properties of 1
µm silica spheres: elastic constants E = 73 GPa and ν = 0.17 [31], and work of adhesion w = 0.063 J/m2
[29].
2.2. Quasi-linear Regime
In the limit of vanishing amplitude, the dynamics are linear, and the medium behaves as the 2D hexagonal
lattice studied in [13]. Using Eqs. (8) - (10) with ϵ = 0, we derive the dispersion relation, and ﬁnd three
modes, as shown in Fig.
2(a): one that involves only longitudinal motion, and two involving coupled
transverse and rotational motions [13, 15]. The dispersion equations are:

where ξ and Ωare the dimensionless wave number and angular frequency (normalized to the lattice spacing
in the y direction and longitudinal mode cutoﬀfrequency [32], respectively), and the transverse-rotational
dispersion matrix M is given by

(13)
Following conventions used in previous works [16, 17], we denote the longitudinal mode “L,” and the lower
and upper transverse-rotational modes as “TR” and “RT,” respectively, where the ﬁrst letter corresponds
to the predominant displacement of each mode. While models for 3D hexagonally close-packed granular
crystals [16], which include shear interactions and particle rotations, predict faster wave speeds, due to
additional interparticle coupling terms, and additional plane wave modes due to periodically alternating
layers (including purely rotational modes), we suggest that our model may also be utilized to gain qualitative
understanding of certain 3D scenarios. This is due to the similarity of acoustic-type L and TR modes, as
well as one of the optical-type RT modes, present in both 2D and 3D systems.

2.3. Weakly-nonlinear Regime: Second Harmonic Generation and Nonlinear Mode Conversion
For |ϵ| << 1, the nonlinear response can be predicted using a successive-approximations approach, in
the manner of Refs. [22, 23]. Using this approach, we represent the displacements as power series in ϵ:
pn(τ)
=
P0,n(τ) + ϵP1,n(τ) + ϵ2P2,n(τ) + . . .
(14)
qn(τ)
=
Q0,n(τ) + ϵQ1,n(τ) + ϵ2Q2,n(τ) + . . .
(15)
φn(τ)
=
Φ0,n(τ) + ϵΦ1,n(τ) + ϵ2Φ2,n(τ) + . . . ,
(16)
and explore second harmonic generation in the granular medium, separately considering the cases of TR/RT
and L modes as FF waves. While previous works employing this approach have focused on ﬁnite-length and
semi-inﬁnite lattices [22, 23] with a harmonic boundary condition, we consider an inﬁnite lattice, and use a
single plane wave of inﬁnite extent that travels in the positive-n direction as the initial condition; that is,
pn(0)
=
P0,n(0) = ˜P0ei(ξn),
(17)
p′
n(0)
=
P ′
0,n(0) = −iΩ˜P0ei(ξn),
(18)
where ˜P0 is a constant amplitude, with similar expressions for the other displacements. Thus, the second
harmonic response is a function of wave number. This conﬁguration closely resembles the conditions of
several recent microgranular experiments [33] that utilize the laser-induced transient grating spectroscopy
technique [34], which excite waves with speciﬁc, deﬁned wavelengths via the projection of a spatially periodic
optical interference pattern.
5We note that, for the expansions (14) - (16) to be valid, each function P0, P1, etc. should be of order
O(1); this imposes limits on the range of wave numbers for which the analysis is valid, as will be discussed
later.
2.3.1. TR and RT Modes as Fundamental Waves
We ﬁrst consider TR and RT modes as FF waves, i.e.
pn(0)

n(0) = 0

qn(0)

Q0,n(0) = ˜Q0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0, q′

(20)
φn(0)
=
Φ0,n(0) = ˜Φ0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0, φ′
n(0) = −iΩφn(0).
(21)
We proceed by substituting the power series (14) - (16) into Eqs. (8) - (10). At order O(ϵ0), we ﬁnd that
P0,n, Q0,n, and Φ0,n must be plane waves satisfying the linear dispersion equations (11) and (12). To satisfy
the initial condition (19), it follows that P0,n(τ) = 0. Furthermore, the ratio of amplitudes of the Q0,n
and Φ0,n plane waves is constrained; in particular, a vector composed of these two amplitudes must be an
eigenvector of the dispersion matrix M corresponding to the eigenvalues ξ and Ω. Because we have chosen
a plane wave in the TR or RT mode as the initial condition, this constraint is trivially satisﬁed.
At order O(ϵ1), we ﬁnd

(24)
Since P0,n = 0, the right-hand side of Eq. (22) is composed of quadratic products of Q0,n and Φ0,n, while
the right-hand sides of Eqs. (23) and (24) vanish. Thus, the second harmonics at order O(ϵ1) generated by
fundamental plane waves in the TR and RT modes are purely longitudinal in character. Furthermore, from
the initial conditions (20) and (21), it follows that Q1,n(τ) = Φ1,n(τ) = 0.
We derive an expression for P1,n(τ) by seeking a solution of the form
P1,n(τ) = ˜P (+)
1,n ei(2ξn−Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P (−)
1,n ei(2ξn+Ω(2ξ)τ) + ˜P (T R)
1,n
ei(2ξn−2Ωτ),
(25)
where Ω(2ξ) is found using Eq. (11). The ﬁrst two terms of ansatz (25) are the homogeneous part of
the solution, with the (+) and (−) superscripts corresponding to positive- and negative-n traveling waves,
respectively. The third term is generated by the FF wave terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (22), and the
superscript (TR) signiﬁes that the generating FF wave is in either transverse-rotational mode. To derive
an expression for the amplitude of the generated SH wave, we substitute into Eq. (22) the expressions
P1,n = ˜P (T R)
1,n
ei(2ξn−2Ωτ), Q0,n = ˜Q0ei(ξn−Ωτ) and Φ0,n = ˜Φ0ei(ξn−Ωτ), and adopt the convention that
the FF amplitudes ˜Q0 and ˜Φ0 have been normalized, such that the sum of their squares is unity. After
simpliﬁcation, we ﬁnd an expression for the amplitude of the longitudinal SH wave that depends on the
amplitudes of the transverse-rotational FF waves, as well as the wave number:
6˜P (T R)

h
−β
√
3 sin(ξ)˜Φ0 + iα sin2(ξ/2) ˜Q0
i
sin2(ξ) −(2Ω)2
,
(26)
where the ratio ˜Q0/˜Φ0 is a function of ξ. This expression is applicable for FF waves in both the TR and
RT modes, and is plotted for each case in Fig. 2(b-c).
In Fig. 2(c), we observe a resonance near ξ ≃π/2; this arises because the generated SH wave of the TR
mode (i.e. the third term of (25)) has a wave number and frequency that intersect the L branch, as shown
in Fig. 2(a). Since the value of ˜P (T R)
1,n
near the resonance is larger than O(1), the expansion (14) is no
longer valid, as the generated harmonics would grow to the same order of magnitude as the FF wave. The
wave number at which this resonance occurs depends on the mass and stiﬀness properties of the lattice, but
the resonance must exist in our model, because the generated SH wave will always possess an intersection
with the L mode, though it may occur outside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. In the limiting case of inﬁnitely large
rotational inertia or vanishing shear contact stiﬀness (i.e. neglecting rotations or shear interactions), the
resonance still exists, albeit at a diﬀerent wave number.
We also note the presence of an antiresonance in Fig. 2(c); this implies that the quadratic nonlinearities
vanish at order O(ϵ1), for a particular wavelength. Near the antiresonance, the harmonics generated by
higher-order nonlinearities can be of the same order of magnitude as the SH waves; thus, these nonlinearities
would need to be included in the equations of motion (8) - (10), and additional terms of the expansions (14)
- (16) should be included, to obtain accurate results. The wave number of this antiresonance is dependent
on mass and stiﬀness properties, but is not guaranteed to exist for arbitrary parameter values; indeed, the
numerator of Eq. (26) is not guaranteed to vanish, except for values of ξ that are integer multiples of π
(corresponding to the edges of the Brillouin zones). We note that the antiresonance cannot exist in the limit
of inﬁnitely large rotational inertia, i.e. ˜Φ0 = 0; this underscores the importance of particle rotations in our
model.
Considering ﬁnite rotational inertia, we derive a condition on the wave number ξ and frequency ω that
must be satisﬁed at the antiresonance. The dispersion relation (12) is a solvability condition of the matrix
equation

(27)
Thus, by manipulating either of the two scalar equations in this system, the ratio ˜Φ0/ ˜Q0 can be written in
terms of ξ, Ω, and lattice stiﬀness and mass parameters. We ﬁnd
˜Φ0
˜Q0

√
3iµ2 sin (ξ)

(28)
By substituting Eq. (28) into the bracketed term in the numerator of (26), equating this expression to zero,
and rearranging, we derive the expression
Ω= sin
ξ

(29)
which deﬁnes a condition for the antiresonance. Thus, if the TR dispersion branch intersects the curve deﬁned
by Eq. (29), the antiresonance exists at the corresponding wave number and frequency, as shown in Fig.
2(a). Furthermore, when the Hertz-Mindlin contact model is assumed, the stiﬀness parameters contained
in (29) are all related by Poisson’s ratio ν [7]. By manipulating (12) and (29), it is straightforward to show
that the TR mode has a higher cutoﬀfrequency at ξ = π than the curve deﬁned by (29), but has a lesser
slope at the origin. It follows that the intersection is guaranteed to exist for physically realizable materials
(i.e. −1 ≤ν ≤0.5).
Enforcing the initial conditions (17) and (18), which imply that P1,n(0) = P ′
1,n(0) = 0, we derive the
amplitudes of the homogeneous terms as a function of the generated second harmonic amplitude:
7˜P (+)

(31)
We note that, for an experimental setup, the FF wave would contain components traveling in both
the positive and negative directions.
In a region where these two components interact, two additional
longitudinal SH waves would be present: a negative-n traveling wave analogous to the third term of (25),
which also has the same dependence on ξ, and a standing wave with wave number 2ξ and vanishing frequency,
which arises due to the interaction between FF waves.
2.3.2. L Mode as Fundamental Wave
We now conduct a similar analysis using a plane wave in the L mode as the FF wave, i.e.
pn(0)
=
P0,n(0) = ˜P0ei(ξn−Ωτ)|τ=0, p′
n(0) = −iΩpn(0)
(32)
qn(0)
=

(33)
q′
n(0)
=
φ′
n(0) = 0.
(34)
By inspecting the quadratic terms in Eqs. (9) - (10), we observe that no motion in the transverse and
rotational displacements can be generated via nonlinearity, because these terms are all products containing
qn and φn. Thus, the remaining equation of motion (8) reduces to a form that is mathematically equivalent
to that in [23], while the boundary conditions diﬀer.
After substituting the power series of (14) into (8), we equate the coeﬃcients of order O(ϵ0), seek solutions
of the form P0,n(τ) = ˜P0ei(ξn−Ωτ), and ﬁnd that P0,n(τ) satisﬁes (11), the dispersion relation for L modes.
At order O(ϵ1), we ﬁnd
P ′′
1,n −1
4(P1,n+1 −2P1,n + P1,n−1) = 1
8(P0,n+1 −2P0,n + P0,n−1)(P0,n+1 −P0,n−1).
(35)
This is a linear equation for P1,n with a generation term that is quadratic in P0,n. Thus, we seek a solution
as the sum of homogeneous and generated second harmonic waves in the form
P1,n(τ) = ˜P (+)

where each term is analogous to the corresponding term in Eq. (25). Here, the superscript (L) signiﬁes
that the generating FF wave belongs to the longitudinal mode. The amplitude of the generated term ˜P (L)
1,n ,
which is analogous to Eq. (26), can be derived as in [23], where a detailed analysis has been performed.
While the system considered in [23] is 1D and clearly not identical to our own, the calculation of ˜P (L)
1,n is
mathematically equivalent.
Because this solution must satisfy the initial conditions (17) and (18), the amplitudes of the homogeneous
terms may by derived in the same way as for transverse-rotational FF waves, and appear in the same form
as (30) and (31), with the exception that the superscript (TR) must be replaced by (L).
3. Simulations
3.1. Numerical Setup
To examine the validity of our theoretical analysis with a complete Hertzian nonlinearity, we simulate
second harmonic generation from an FF wave in the TR mode by numerically solving the equations of
motion (1) - (3) for 1 < n < 201. We use initial conditions of the form (20) - (21), with ﬁxed boundaries.
For each case, we probe the response of the central lattice site (n = 101), and end the simulation before
disturbances caused by the boundaries reach this site. We present the results in terms of the normalized
variables p101(τ), q101(τ), and φ101(τ).

Figure 3: (a-c) Transverse and rotational displacements for ξ1 = 0.80, ξ2 = 1.475, and ξ3 = 2.127. Black and blue solid lines
correspond to simulated transverse and rotational displacements, while red dashed and magenta dash-dotted lines show the
corresponding theoretical predictions. (d-f) Simulated (black solid) and theoretical (red dashed) curves showing longitudinal
displacements for the wave numbers of (a-c).
As shown in Fig. (3), we simulate the lattice using three wave numbers, each representing a qualitatively
diﬀerent case: 1) ξ1 = 0.802, which is far from the resonance and antiresonance; 2) ξ2 = 1.475, which
is approximately the resonant wave number; and 3) ξ3 = 2.127, which is approximately the antiresonant
wave number. We have chosen the characteristic amplitude D0 = 0.2∆0, which results in the nonlinearity
parameter ϵsim ≈−0.1.
For case 1), the perturbation analysis is valid (note from Fig. 2(c) that ˜P (T R)
1,n
≃O(1)), and the simulated
time histories are well-approximated by the theoretical predictions, as shown in Fig. 3(a,d). In Fig. 3(d), it
can be seen that the SH amplitude exhibits “beating” at a frequency Ωbeat = Ω(2ξ)−2Ω; this phenomenon is
a well-known characteristic of SH generation [20, 23]. For case 2), the oscillations of p101 grow linearly in τ,
as shown in Fig. 3(e). While the theoretical prediction for p101 appears to match the simulation reasonably
well, it is evident from Fig. 3(b) that there is signiﬁcant error in q101 and φ101; in fact, the second harmonic
is visibly present in the simulated signals. This is because, while the approximation works well for small τ,
the generated SH longitudinal wave eventually reaches the same order of magnitude as the FF wave, thereby
violating the assumption of weak nonlinearity. For case 3), the predictions for q101 and φ101 are accurate, as
shown in Fig. 3(b). However, as shown in Fig. 3(f), there is large error in p101, the generated longitudinal
wave. This is because the harmonics generated by higher-order nonlinearities are larger than those coming
from order O(ϵ1); such harmonics are clearly visible in the simulated signal.
4. Conclusion
In this work, we have analyzed shear to longitudinal mode conversion via SH generation for plane waves
in a 2D, adhesive, hexagonally close-packed microscale granular crystal, accounting for translational and
9rotational degrees of freedom, as well as normal and shear contact interactions. In the case of a FF wave
in the L mode, we show that the generated SH is also longitudinal, and can be described using the same
equations as for a 1D chain studied in earlier works. For the case where the lowest TR mode is treated as the
FF wave, the generated SH wave is longitudinal, and an analytical expression for the SH amplitude reveals
the presence of resonant and antiresonant wave numbers. This antiresonance is not predicted if rotations
are excluded from the model, which demonstrates that, while the TR mode is predominantly transverse
for most wavelengths, particle rotations produce a qualitative change in the nonlinear lattice dynamics.
By simulating a lattice with DMT and Hertz-Mindlin particle interactions, we verify the accuracy of the
theoretical analysis for a non-resonant case, and ﬁnd that it eﬀectively predicts the qualitative behavior
of the resonant and antiresonant cases.
Future generalizations of this work to oﬀ-symmetry directions
of propagation and extension to strongly nonlinear dynamical regimes may yield particularly interesting
phenomena. This work is particularly suitable for the analysis of both microscale granular crystals, which
are naturally precompressed by adhesive forces, and statically compressed granular crystals with macroscale
particles.
We expect that future studies of such 2- and 3D granular media will yield unique dynamics
stemming from the interplay of interparticle shear coupling and particle rotations with highly nonlinear
phenomena such as solitary waves [3] or hysteretic contact mechanics [35].
