1Abstract:
A signiﬁcant step in space exploration during the 21st century will be human settlement on Mars.
Instead of transporting all the construction materials from Earth to the red planet with incredibly high
cost, using Martian soil to construct a site on Mars is a superior choice. Knowing that Mars has long
been considered a “sulfur-rich planet”, a new construction material composed of simulated Martian soil
and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw material availability for producing sulfur concrete
and a strength reaching similar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing, low
temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100% recyclability are appealing supe-
rior characteristics of the developed Martian Concrete. In this study, diﬀerent percentages of sulfur are
investigated to obtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconﬁned compression and
splitting tests were conducted to determine strength development, strength variability, and failure mecha-
nisms. The test results show that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete utilizing
regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution plays an important role in the mixture’s
ﬁnal strength. Furthermore, since Martian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also
formed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high strength. The optimal mix
developed as Martian Concrete has an unconﬁned compressive strength of above 50 MPa. The formulated
Martian Concrete is simulated by the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which exhibits excellent
ability in modeling the material response under various loading conditions.

Introduction
Sulfur has been used as a molten bonding agent for quite a long time in human history. The use of
sulfur was mentioned in literature of ancient India, Greece, China and Egypt [7]. For example, sulfur was
one of the raw materials to manufacture gunpowder by ancient Chinese [29]; sulfur was also used to anchor
metal in stone during the 17th century [6]. Starting in the 1920s, sulfur concrete has been reported to
be utilized as a construction material [24]. Various researchers and engineers studied and succeeded in
obtaining high-strength and acid-resistant sulfur concretes [1, 2, 3]. In the late 1960s, Dale and Ludwig
pointed out the signiﬁcance of well-graded aggregate in obtaining optimum strength [4, 5].
2When elemental sulfur and aggregate are hot-mixed, cast, and cooled to prepare sulfur concrete prod-
ucts, the sulfur binder, on cooling from the liquid state, ﬁrst crystallizes as monoclinic sulfur (Sβ) at
238 ◦F (114 ◦C). On further cooling to below 204 ◦F (96 ◦C), Sβ starts to transform to orthorhombic sulfur
(Sα), which is the stable form of sulfur at ambient room temperatures [8]. This transformation is rapid,
generally occurring in less than 24 hours and resulting in a solid construction material. However, since
Sα is much denser than Sβ, high stress and cavities can be induced by sulfur shrinkage. Hence, durability
of unmodiﬁed sulfur concrete is a problem when exposed to humid environment or after immersion in
water. In the 1970s, researchers developed techniques to modify the sulfur by reacting it with oleﬁnic
hydrocarbon polymers [9, 16], dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) [10, 12, 11, 15, 17], or other additives and stabi-
lizers [13, 14, 18] to improve durability of the product. Since then, commercial production and installation
of corrosion-resistant sulfur concrete has been increasing, either precast or installed directly in industrial
plants where portland cement concrete materials fail from acid and salt corrosion [24].
For earth applications, well developed sulfur concrete features (1) improved mechanical performance:
high compressive & ﬂexural strength, high durability, acid & salt water resistant, excellent surface ﬁnish
and pigmentation, superior freeze/thaw performance; (2) cost beneﬁts: faster setting-solid within hours
instead of weeks, increased tolerance to aggregate choice; and (3) environmentally friendly proﬁle: reduced
CO2 footprint, no water requirements, easily obtainable sulfur as a byproduct of gasoline production,
recyclable via re-casting, compatible with ecosystem, e.g. for marine applications. Current pre-cast sulfur
concrete products include, but are not limited to, ﬂagstones, umbrella stand, counterweights for high
voltage lines, and drainage channel [38].
For example, in January 2009, around 80 meters sewage pipeline in the United Arab Emirates was
removed and replaced by sulfur concrete. In the same time period, a total of 215 ﬁsh reef blocks made of
sulfur concrete (2.2 tons/block) were stacked at a depth of 15 meters, 6 kilometers oﬀthe coast of UAE
[35]. With regular concrete ﬁsh reefs, the growth of algae and shells takes time because concrete is alkaline.
However, since sulfur concrete is practically neutral in alkalinity, algae and shell growth was observed soon
after installation.
While sulfur concrete found its way into practice as an infrastructure material, it is also a superior
choice for space construction considering the very low water availability on the nearby planets and satellites
3[23]. After mankind stepped on the lunar surface in 1969, space agencies have been planning to go back and
build a research center on the moon. Since local material is preferred to reduce expenses, starting in the
early 1990s, NASA and collaborative researchers studied and developed lunar concrete using molten sulfur.
Around the year 1993, Omar [20] made lunar concrete by mixing lunar soil simulant with diﬀerent sulfur
ratio ranging from 25% up to 70% and found the optimum mix with 35% sulfur to reach a compressive
strength of 34 MPa. Later he added 2% of steel ﬁbers to the mixes and increased the optimum strength to
43 MPa. However, lunar concrete has serious sublimation issues because of the near-vacuum environment
on the moon. In 2008, Grugel and Toutanji [31, 33, 41] reported experimental results of two lunar concrete
mixes: (1) 35% sulfur with 65% lunar soil simulant JSC-1, and (2) 25% sulfur and 20% silica binder mixture
with 55% JSC-1. The two mixtures, similar in strength (∼35 MPa), revealed a continuous weight loss
due to the sublimation of sulfur when placed in a vacuum environment, 5×10−7 torr, at 20 ◦C for 60
days. Based on the measurements, it was predicted that sublimation of a 1 cm deep layer from the two
sulfur concrete mixes would take 4.4 and 6.5 years respectively. The sublimation rate varied from rapid at
the high lunar temperatures (<120 ◦C) to essentially nonexistent at the low lunar temperatures (-180 ◦C
to -220 ◦C). However, the low temperature on the moon is too harsh to maintain intact the mechanical
properties of sulfur concrete. After cycled 80 times between -191 ◦C (-312 ◦F) and 20 ◦C (68 ◦F), the
samples failed at about 7 MPa under compression, which is about 1/5 of the average strength, 35 MPa,
of the non-cycled samples.
While the moon is the closest and only satellite of earth, its near-vacuum environment, broad tem-
perature range and long day-night rhythm, about 30 earth days, are not the most adequate for human
settlement. Venus is the closest planet to Earth, however it is also the hottest planet in the solar system
with an average surface temperature over 400 ◦C [45], making it uninhabitable for humans. Mars, on the
other hand, is not too hot or too cold, and has an atmosphere to protect humans from radiation. Its
day/night rhythm is very similar to that on Earth: a Mars day is about 24 hours and 37 minutes [25].
Thus, Mars is the most habitable planet in the solar system after Earth. In recent years, many countries,
including the U.S., China, and Russia, announced to launch manned Mars missions in the next decades.
Due to the dry environment on Mars, sulfur concrete concept is a superior choice for building a human
village on the red planet. Studies of Martian meteorites suggest elevated sulfur concentrations in the inte-
4rior, and Martian surface deposits contain high levels of sulfur (SO3 up to 37 wt%, average 6 wt%), likely
in the forms of sulﬁde minerals and sulfate salts [37]. Except of the easiest option of ﬁnding a sulfur mine
on Mars, like the one in Sicily on Earth, elemental sulfur can be extracted from sulﬁdes or sulfates through
various chemical and physical processes, for example, by heating up the sulfur compounds [19]. NASA
has advanced programs on In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) [30] for this speciﬁc purpose. Moreover,
the atmospheric pressure (0.636 kPa) [34] as well as temperature range (≤35 ◦C) are highly suitable for
the application of sulfur concrete. As shown in Fig. 1 [31], the most possible construction site on Mars
has environmental conditions in the Rhombic (stable) state of sulfur and is three orders of magnitude in
pressure above the solid-vapor interface. Thus, sublimation is not an issue and a relatively warm area can
be selected as the construction site. Furthermore, with the temperature on Mars lower than 35 ◦C, the
drawback of sulfur concrete melting at high temperature will not be an issue for initial constructions such
as shelters and roads while certainly might be of concern for long term settlements in which ﬁre resistance
would be important.
To let the thoughts become facts, a new construction material using simulated Martian soil and molten
sulfur is developed in this study. Diﬀerent percentages of sulfur are studied to obtain the optimal mixing
proportions. Through mechanical tests, it is found that Martian Concrete have much higher strengths than
sulfur concrete utilizing regular sand. Sieve analysis and chemical analysis provide possible explaination for
the higher strength of Martian Concrete: the Martian soil simulant has a better particle size distribution,
it is also rich in metal elements, which react with sulfur, forming polysulfates and possibly enhancing
strengths. Mechanical simulations of Martian Concrete are then carried out using the state-of-art Lattice
Discrete Particle Model with excellent simulation of Martian Concrete mechanical properties.

Experimental Study of Martian Concrete
Sulfur concrete products are manufactured by hot-mixing sulfur and aggregate. The sulfur binder ﬁrst
crystalizes as monoclinic sulfur (Sβ), and then the mixture cools down while sulfur transforms to the stable
orthorhombic polymorph (Sα), achieving a reliable construction material. While sulfur is commercially
available, Martian soil simulant JSC Mars-1A [32] was obtained in replacement of Martian soil to develop
a feasible Martian Concrete. Table 1 lists the major element composition of the simulant. As seen, the
Martian soil simulant, resembling the actual Martian soil [22], is rich with metal element oxides, especially
aluminium oxide and ferric oxide. In this study, various percentages of sulfur are mixed with JSC Mars-1A
in a heated mixer at above 120 ◦C. Temperature measurements are performed during mixing to ensure
sulfur melting. Then the mixture is transferred to 25.4×25.4×127 mm (1×1×5 in) aluminum formwork
when it reached ﬂowable state or best mixing conditions. Afterwards the material was let to cool down
at room temperature, about 20 ◦C. Martian soil simulant Mars-1A of maximum 5 mm aggregate size was
ﬁrst used for casting, however the specimens showed many voids and uneven surfaces due to the large
aggregate, see Fig. 2a. Sulfur cannot be ensured to ﬁll the large number of big voids or to surround
and bind all large aggregates, especially on the specimen surface. Afterwards, only Mars-1A of maximum
1 mm aggregate size was utilized to achieve Martian Concrete (MC) with ﬂat and smooth surfaces, see
Fig. 2b. Mechanical tests were conducted after 24 hours, and these included unconﬁned compression,
notched and unnotched three-point-bending (TPB), and splitting (Brazilian) tests. Beams of dimensions
25.4×25.4×127 mm (1×1×5 in) are used for TPB tests, which are then cut to 25.4 mm (1 in) cubes for
compression and splitting tests.

Unconﬁned Compression Test
Unconﬁned compression tests were performed in a closed loop servo-hydraulic load frame with a maximum
capacity of 489 kN (110 kips). Stroke/displacement control with a loading rate of 0.003 mm/s was applied.
In order to ensure consistent and accurate test results, a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for testing
was created. The test protocol was ﬁrst ﬁlled with the relevant details, which include Vernier Caliper
measurements of each dimension (average of 2 ∼4 measurements), the initial weight, the label of the
specimen, control mode, loading rate, and start time of loading. Pictures were taken to document the
initial condition of the specimen, during test and post test states. A preload of approximately 1-5 % of
the expected peak-load was applied before the actual test commenced.
Specimens used for unconﬁned compression tests were 25.4 mm (1 in) cubes cut from the undamaged
parts of 25.4×25.4×127 mm (1×1×5 in) beams, see Fig. 3a. The cubes were cut out of the 62 mm (2.5 in)
long failed half’s at the center between bending test support point and fracture surface. Typical cone type
of failure is observed of Martian Concrete under unconﬁned compression, as shown in Fig. 3b.
The studied sulfur ratio for Martian Concrete under compression tests ranged from 35 wt% to 60
wt%. Compressive strength versus percentage of sulfur is shown in Fig. 4 (circles), revealing an optimum
percentage around 50% (± 2.5%). Furthermore, the test results indicate that recast can further increase
strength of the material. For 50% sulfur batches, recast made compressive strength go up from 48 MPa
to about 58 ∼63 MPa, which is roughly a 20 ∼30% increase, see Fig. 4 labeled as “Mars1A 1mm R.”.
Furthermore, better mixing and applying pressure while placing the material in formwork facilitates ma-

terial strength. In the experimental campaign of this study, a well distributed pressure was manually
added to the mixture in formwork, and thus the pressure was not quantiﬁed. Making the mixture compact
facilitates formation of sulfur bonds and also reduces the number and size of cavities of the ﬁnal product.
Average compressive stress-strain curves for MC with sulfur ratio ranging from 40% to 60% are plotted
in Fig. 5a. Stress is calculated as P/A, where P is load and A is the area of the cross section; strain
is calculated as ∆h/h, where h is the height of the specimen. The stress-strain curves feature a typical
almost-linear behavior up to the peak and a long stable softening post-peak.
While Martian Concrete has a high strength of over 50 MPa with relatively high percentage of sulfur,
sulfur concrete made of regular sand (Sand Concrete, SC) was cast and tested as well for comparison.
With the same dimension of 25.4 mm (1 in), SC cubes were cast with a sulfur ratio in the range of 15%
∼35%. Sand with a maximum aggregate size of 11 mm was ﬁrst utilized. Then for comparison purposes,
maximum 1 mm sand, sieved from the coarser sand, was used as well. Following the same test procedure,
SC specimens were tested under unconﬁned compression loads. As shown in Fig. 4, the best percentage
of sulfur for SC was found to be about 25% for both ﬁne (crosses in Fig. 4) and coarse (squares in Fig. 4)
mixes, having 24.5 MPa and 28.3 MPa compressive strength, respectively. The results obtained on the SC
mixes are consistent with the existing literature on standard sulfur concrete [24]. When the aggregate size
distribution of the ﬁne sand was modiﬁed based upon the particle size distribution of Mars-1A simulant,
its SC mix’s stregnth had a 29% jump to 31.5 MPa, see Fig. 4 labeled as “Sand1A 1mm” and marked with
a diamond symbol. This indicates and conﬁrms the signiﬁcance of the particle size distribution in order
to obtain an optimum material strength.

Particle Size Distribution Analysis
While 25% of elemental sulfur works the best for both mixes with regular sand, they also both have much
lower strength compare to Martian Concrete. To study the inﬂuence of aggregates and the corresponding
particle size distribution (PSD) on material strength, sieve analyses of Mars-1A (maximum 1 mm aggregate
size) as well as regular sand (maximum 11 mm aggregate size) were conducted. Also included in the PSD
analysis were the recommended PSDs by ASTM and AASHTO standards for mixing sulfur concrete
[24]. In Fig. 6, the normalized distributions of Mars-1A, regular sand, the ASTM D 3515 and AASHTO
recommended PSD ranges as well as Fuller’s law with power 1/2 are plotted and compared. Overall, the
PSD of Mars-1A falls well in the recommended PSD range according to standards and is relatively close
to Fuller’s law, while the PSD of regular sand misses the recommended PSD range and also deviates from
Fuller’s law. While this ﬁnding explains partly the diﬀerence in the measured strength of MC and SC, it
cannot justify the more than doubled strength of MC compared to SC.
2.3
Microscopy Study
In addition to the PSD of aggregate, other factors must play a role concerning the ﬁnal strength obtained
in MC experiments. Fig. 7 & 8 show the microscope study of Martian Concrete (MC) and sulfur concrete
with regular sand (SC) with optimal compositions. By comparing the particles of MC and SC in the
11(a)
(b)
Figure 7: Microscopy study of sulfur concrete on 1 mm scale with compositions of (a) 50% sulfur and 50%
Martian soil simulant (b) 25% sulfur and 75% regular sand and a maximum particle size of 1 mm
mesostructure pictures, a few observations are in order. Firstly, the visible average particle size of MC
is much smaller than that of SC after hot mixing, although both mixes use aggregate with maximum
particle size up to 1 mm. After casting and curing, the aggregate particles and their sizes can be well
distinguished for SC; on the contrary, the majority of MC particles are below 500 microns. Secondly, the
MC mix has many red areas, dark spots and almost no voids, while the SC mix shows distinguishably
yellow areas of sulfur, opaque orange to dark red spots related to sand particles and a number of voids
of around 200 microns.
These observations, along with preliminary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) tests, suggest that the metal elements in Mars-1A react with sulfur during hot mixing, forming
sulfates and polysulfates, and altering the PSD of aggregates to lower ends, which further enhance the
MC strength. SC does not have such phenomena because silica sand does not react with sulfur at the
aforementioned casting conditions. In other words, in MC aggregate is chemically active whereas in SC
is inert and sulfur only serves as “glue” for the sand particles. The existence of sulfates and polysulfates
in MC are qualitatively conﬁrmed by XPS by analyzing the chemical state of sulfur and individual metal
elements within 900 micron-diameter areas of a thin MC sample. Deﬁnitely, further research is needed to
clearly identify the chemical products characterizing MC internal structure.
2.4
Three-point-bending Fracture Test
To complete the mechanical characterization of MC, its fracturing behavior is studied in this section and
the next. Beam specimens with nominal dimensions 25.4×25.4×127 mm (1×1×5 in) were cast to perform

Figure 8: Microscopy study of sulfur concrete on 400 µm scale with compositions of (a) 50% sulfur and
50% Martian soil simulant (b) 25% sulfur and 75% regular sand and a maximum particle size of 1 mm
three-point-bending (TPB) tests. The beam specimens featured a half-depth notch at midspan cut with a
diamond coated band-saw machine. Testing notched samples is customary in fracture mechanics to control
the fracture onset and to capture post-peak behavior. Dimension and weight measurements were recorded
on speciﬁcally optimized TPB protocols. Centerline on top of specimen, and support lines at the bottom
were pre-marked then aligned within the servo-hydraulic load frame, which had a capacity of 22.2 kN
(5 kip). The adopted TPB test setup is shown in Fig. 9a. The nominal span (distance between bottom
supports) was 101.6 mm (4 in). An extensometer sensor was glued to the bottom of the specimens with the
notch in between its two feet. After applying a pre-load of up to 5% of the expected peak, the specimens
were loaded in crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control with a loading rate of 0.0001 mm/sec,
which was increased in the post-peak section to limit the total testing time while ensuring a fully recorded
softening behavior. Typical crack propagation and fracture surface after failure are presented in Fig. 9b&c.
The crack starts at the notch tip and develops upward along the ligament.
Notched (50%) fracture test stress-strain curves of MC with sulfur ratio in the range of 40% ∼60%
are plotted in Fig. 5b. The nominal tensile ﬂexural stress is calculated as σ = 3PL/2bh2, where P is load,
and L, b, and h are span, width, and depth of the specimen respectively; the nominal strain is calculated
as ϵ=CMOD/h. The optimal percentage of sulfur is found to be 50% (± 2.5%) which gives a nominal
ﬂexural strength of approximately 1.65 MPa, and it agrees with the optimal percentage determined from
unconﬁned compression tests. The highest nominal ﬂexural strength obtained is 2.3 MPa reached by one
of the two recast 50% sulfur batches, as shown in Fig. 10a. It must be observed that nominal ﬂexural

strength and ﬂexural nominal stress-strain curves are not material properties, due to the presence of the
notch, and they are calculated here only for comparison purposes. The typical material property that
can be calculated from TPB test is the fracture energy, deﬁned as the energy per unit area needed to
create a unit stress-free fracture area. By adopting the work-of-fracture method [21] the fracture energy is
computed by dividing the area under the load vs. stroke curve by the ligament area. The highest average
total fracture energy is as well reached by the recast Martian Concrete with 50% sulfur with a value of
67 J/m2, as shown in Fig. 10b. When mixed with lower or higher sulfur ratio than 50%, MC has lower
fracture energies, see Fig. 5b and Fig. 10b. Same as for compressive strength, recast and applying pressure
can as well improve material ﬂexural strength thanks to more compact sulfur bonds.
2.5
Splitting and Modulus of Rupture Tests
Splitting tests on 25.4 mm (1 in) cubes were performed by the same load frame as for compression.
Roughly 1 mm diameter bars were placed on the top and at the bottom of the specimen. A loading rate
of 0.003 mm/s was applied until failure of the specimen at peak load. Only recast Martian Concrete with
47.5%, 50%, and 52.5% were tested, and provided splitting tensile strength of 3.6 MPa ± 30%, 3.9 MPa

where P is load, b and h are the depth and height of the cube specimen respectively. In agreement with
compression and TPB test results, splitting tests again conﬁrm that MC with 50% of sulfur have the
highest performance. The splitting nominal stress-strain curves, until failure at peak load, of the optimum
MC are shown in Fig. 16b, where nominal strain is calculated as vertical displacement divided by the
specimen height.
Modulus of rupture (MOR) tests were carried out for MC with the optimum mix, 50% sulfur and 50%
Martian soil simulant. Unnotched beams with dimensions 25.4×25.4×127 mm (1×1×5 in) were tested for
MOR using the aforementioned machine and setup for notched TPB but by stroke control with loading
rate 0.001 mm/s. The developed MC has an average MOR value of 7.24 MPa, see Fig. 16a. The nominal
MOR stress is calculated as σ = 3PL/2bh2, where P is load, L, b, and h are span, width, and depth of the
specimen respectively; the nominal strain is calculated as vertical displacement divide by specimen depth.

Lattice discrete Particle Model Simulations
For design and analysis purposes it is important to formulate and validate a computational model for the
simulation of Martian Concrete. This is pursued within the theoretical framework of the Lattice Discrete
Particle Model (LDPM).
In 2011, building on previous work [26, 27, 28], Cusatis and coworkers [39, 40] developed LDPM, a
mesoscale discrete model that simulates the mechanical interaction of coarse aggregate pieces embedded
15in a binding matrix. The geometrical representation of concrete mesostructure is constructed by randomly
introducing and distributing spherical shaped coarse aggregate pieces inside the volume of interest and
zero-radius aggregate pieces on the surface. Based on the Delaunay tetrahedralization of the generated
particle centers, a three-dimensional domain tessellation creates a system of polyhedral cells (see Fig. 11)
interacting through triangular facets and a lattice system. The full description of LDPM geometry is
reported in Cusatis. et. al. [39, 40].
Figure 11: One LDPM Cell around an aggregate piece.
In LDPM, rigid body kinematics is used to describe the deformation of the lattice particle system and
the displacement jump, JuCK, at the centroid of each facet is used to deﬁne measures of strain as

where ℓ= interparticle distance; and n, l, and m, are unit vectors deﬁning a local system of reference

L are mesoscale eigenstrains (if any present). For stresses and strains beyond the elastic limit,
the LDPM formulation considers the following nonlinear mesoscale phenomena [26, 27, 39]: (1) fracture
and cohesion; (2) compaction and pore collapse; and (3) internal friction.

L(t/e∗). The eﬀective stress t is incrementally elastic (˙t = E0 ˙e) and must satisfy the inequal-
16ity 0 ≤t ≤σbt(e, ω) where σbt = σ0(ω) exp [−H0(ω)⟨e −e0(ω)⟩/σ0(ω)], ⟨x⟩= max{x, 0}, and tan(ω) =

Compaction and pore collapse from compression.
Normal stresses for compressive loading
(e∗
N < 0) must satisfy the inequality −σbc(eD, eV ) ≤tN ≤0, where σbc is a strain-dependent boundary
depending on the volumetric strain, eV , and the deviatoric strain, eD = eN −eV . The volumetric strain is
computed by the volume variation of the Delaunay tetrahedra as eV = ∆V/3V0 and is assumed to be the
same for all facets belonging to a given tetrahedron. Beyond the elastic limit, −σbc models pore collapse
as a linear evolution of stress for increasing volumetric strain with stiﬀness Hc for −eV ≤ec1 = κc0ec0:
σbc = σc0 + ⟨−eV −ec0⟩Hc(rDV ); Hc(rDV ) = Hc0/(1 + κc2 ⟨rDV −κc1⟩); σc0 is the mesoscale compressive
yield stress; rDV = eD/eV and κc1, κc2 are material parameters. Compaction and rehardening occur beyond
pore collapse (−eV ≥ec1). In this case one has σbc = σc1(rDV ) exp [(−eV −ec1)Hc(rDV )/σc1(rDV )] and
σc1(rDV ) = σc0 + (ec1 −ec0)Hc(rDV ).
Friction due to compression-shear. For compression dominated loading conditions (e∗

incremental shear stresses are computed as ˙tM = ET(˙e∗

M = ˙ξ∂ϕ/∂tM,

L = ˙ξ∂ϕ/∂tL, and ξ is the plastic multiplier with loading-unloading conditions ϕ ˙ξ ≤0 and ˙ξ ≥0. The
plastic potential is deﬁned as ϕ =

M + t2
L −σbs(tN), where the nonlinear frictional law for the shear
strength is assumed to be σbs = σs +(µ0 −µ∞)σN0[1−exp(tN/σN0)]−µ∞tN; σN0 is the transitional normal
stress; µ0 and µ∞are the initial and ﬁnal internal friction coeﬃcients.
Each meso-level parameter in LDPM governs part of the mechanical material behavior. The normal
elastic modulus, which refers to the stiﬀness for the normal facet behavior, E0, , along with the coupling
parameter α, govern LDPM response in the elastic regime.
Approximately, the macro scale Young’s
modulus E and Poisson’s ratios ν can be calculated as E = E0(2 + 3α)/(4 + α) and ν = (1 −α)/(4 + α).
Typical concrete Poisson’s ratio of about 0.18 is obtained by setting α = 0.25 [40]. The tensile strength, σt,
and characteristic length, ℓt, govern the strain softening behavior due to fracture in tension of LDPM facets
17[40], with the relation Gt = ℓtσ2
t /2E0, where Gt is the mesoscale fracture energy. Calibration of σt and ℓt
is typically achieved by ﬁtting experimental data, e.g. the nominal stress-strain curves of TPB tests. The
yielding compressive stress, σc0, deﬁnes the behavior of the facet normal component under compression.
The softenig exponent, nt, governs the interaction between shear and tensile behavior during softening
at the facet level and it governs the macroscopic compressive behavior at high conﬁnement. One obtains
more ductile behavior in both compression and tension by increasing nt, however the increase is more
pronounced in compression than in tension. The initial internal friction, µ0, mainly govern the mechanical
response in compression at low conﬁnement and have no inﬂuence on tensile behavior. Descriptions of
eﬀects and functions of other LDPM mesoscale parameters and further discussions can be found in Cusatis
et. al. [40] and Wan et. al. [48].
LDPM has been utilized successfully to simulate cementitious concrete behavior under various loading
conditions [39, 40]. Furthermore, the framework has been extended to properly account for ﬁber reinforce-
ment [42, 43] and has the ability to simulate the mechanical behavior of ultra high performance concrete
(UHPC) [44, 46, 48] and long term behavior of concrete with fastening applications [47].
Although Martian Concrete has sulfur bonds instead of calcium-silicate-hydrate gels, it shares with
cementitious concrete the heterogeneous internal structure, which is the basis of the LDPM formulation.
Thus, LDPM is adopted to simulate the mechanical behavior of the Martian Concrete. The numerical sim-
ulations presented in this paper were performed with the software MARS, a multi-purpose computational
code, which implements LDPM, for the explicit dynamic simulation of structural performance [36]. As
aforementioned, the particle size of aggregate in MC is shifted to lower ends after casting, however, the ex-
act distribution cannot be obtained and simulating the smallest particles would result in signiﬁcantly high
computation cost. Thus, the discrete particles are generated randomly with aggregate piece of 0.5 to 1 mm
and Fuller’s law to the power 1/2 for each type of specimen. The utilized mesoscale parameters for MC
with the best sulfur ratio (50%) are listed in Table 2. The TPB experimental data was primarily utilized
to calibrate the LDPM parameters governing elastic as well as fracture behavior, which include normal
modulus, tensile strength, shear strength ratio, tensile characteristic length, and softening exponent. Note
that the normal modulus is calibrated by the TPB test data because the nominal strain (CMOD/h) is
directly measured on the specimen, while all other tests include the eﬀect of the test machine compliance.
18Compression experimental data was then used to calibrate the shear strength, the softening exponent and
the initial internal friction. The other parameters’ values, relevant to conﬁned compressive behavior, are
determined based on calibrated sets for typical concrete materials available in the literature [40, 48] and
are assumed to work also for Martian Concrete in absence of speciﬁc experimental data. The adopted
values are densiﬁcation ratio = 1, asymptotic friction = 0, transitional stress = 300 MPa, volumetric devi-
atoric coupling coeﬃcient = 0, deviatoric strain threshold ratio = 1, and deviatoric damage parameter =
5. After all LDPM parameters had been calibrated and determined, prediction simulations for unnotched
TPB tests and splitting tests were carried out and compared to experimental data as validation.
The LDPM simulation setup, typical failure type and crack propagation of notched TPB, unconﬁned
compression, splitting, and unnotched TPB tests are shown in Fig, 12, 13, & 14 respectively.
Note
that in the notched and unnotched TPB simulation setup (Fig. 12 & 14), the specimen is composed of
lattice discrete particles at the center and classical elastic ﬁnite elements on the two sides, where only
elastic deformation is expected to occur, to save computational time. In the unconﬁned compression test
simulation, high friction parameters for typical concrete-steel slippage interaction [40] are utilized: µs =
0.13, µd = 0.015, and s0 = 1.3 mm, to simulate friction between the specimen ends and the steel loading
platens, assuming a slippage-dependent friction coeﬃcient formulated as µ(s) = µd + (µs −µd)s0/(s0 + s).
The ﬁtted stress-strain curves can be found in Fig. 15 & 16. Fig. 15a shows the nominal stress-strain curves
for 50% notched TPB tests and the material has total fracture energy, GF, of 67.0 J/m2. The mesoscale
initial fracture energy calculated from LDPM parameters, Gt = ℓtσ2
t /2E0 = 37.6 J/m2, is approximately
half of GF. This is due to the fact that even under macroscopic mode I fracture the mesoscale response is
characterized by both shear and tension. Fig. 15b presents the experimental and simulated stress-strain
curves of unconﬁned compression test.
Young’s modulus E is back calculated as the aforementioned
equation E = E0(2 + 3α)/(4 + α) and has an average value of 6.5 GPa. This value is then used to remove
the machine compliance in experimental compression test data.
Brittle failure is observed both in experiments and simulations for unnotched TPB and splitting tests,
as shown in Fig. 16 a & b respectively. The compliance in splitting and unnotched TPB experimental data
is removed according to calibrated simulations. As pure predictions, the simulation peaks highly agree
with the average strengths of the experiments. This indicates the superior ability of LDPM to simulate and

concrete materials.

Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion, the developed sulfur based Martian Concrete is feasible for construction on Mars for its easy
handling, fast curing, high strength, recyclability, and adaptability in dry and cold environments. Sulfur
is abundant on Martian surface and Martian regolith simulant is found to have well graded particle size
distribution to ensure high strength mix. Both the atmospheric pressure and temperature range on Mars
are adequate for hosting sulfur concrete structures. Based upon the experimental and numerical results
presented in this paper, the following conclusions can be drawn:
• The best mix for producing Martian Concrete (MC) is 50% sulfur and 50% Martian soil simulant
with maximum aggregate size of 1 mm. The developed MC can reach compressive strength higher
than 50 MPa.
• The optimum particle size distribution (PSD) of Martian regolith simulant is found to play a role in
achieving high strength MC compared to sulfur concrete with regular sand.
• The rich metal elements in Martian soil simulant are found to be reactive with sulfur during hot
mixing, possibly forming sulfates and polysulfates, which further increases MC strength. Simultane-
ously, the particle size distribution of aggregate is shifted to lower ends, resulting in less voids and
higher performance of the ﬁnal mix.
• With the advantage of recyclability, recast of MC can further increase the material’s overall perfor-
22mance.
• Applying pressure during casting can also increase the ﬁnal strength of MC. Sulfur shrinks when is
cooled down. By reducing the mixture’s volume during casting, the number and size of cavities of
the ﬁnal product are decreased.
• Although developed for conventional cementitious concrete, the Lattice Discrete Particle Model
(LDPM) shows also excellent ability in simulating the mechanical behavior of MC under various
loading conditions.
