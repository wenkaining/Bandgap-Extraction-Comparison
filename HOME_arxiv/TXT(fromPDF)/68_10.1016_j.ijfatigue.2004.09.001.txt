This paper presents an experimental study of the fretting crack nucleation threshold, expressed
in terms of loading conditions, with a cylinder/plane contact. The studied material is a damage
tolerant aluminium alloy widely used in the aerospace application. Since in industrial problems, the
surface quality is often variable, the impact of a unidirectional roughness is investigated via varying
the roughness of the counter body in the fretting experiments. As expected, experimental results
show a large eﬀect of the contact roughness on the crack nucleation conditions. Rationalisation of
the crack nucleation boundary independently of the studied roughnesses was successfully obtained by
introducing the concept of eﬀective contact area. This does show that the fretting crack nucleation
of the studied material can be eﬃciently described by the local eﬀective loadings inside the contact.
Analytical prediction of the crack nucleation is presented with the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT)
parameter and size eﬀect is also studied and discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Weight saving is still a topical issue in aerospace ap-
plications. Because of their low densities, aluminium al-
loys are widely used in air plane structures, in spite of
quite bad fatigue and tribological properties. As noted by
many authors [1, 2], a very important example of applica-
tion is riveted lap joints structures, where contact fretting
stress, due to vibrations during the ﬂight, can initiate
cracks at the hole edge which may propagate due to the
overall structure fatigue stress. In the worst case, propa-
gation will lead to failure. Authors [2, 3] also report par-
tial slip in rivet structures. This shows the importance
of investigating fretting crack initiation boundary in par-
tial slip conditions of concerned material. In addition,
in industrial application, where variable surface qualities
can be found, one major issue is the impact of surface
roughness on the crack nucleation process. Coupling ex-
periments and modelling this paper focuses on this topic
in order to predict the cracking risk on a 2024T351 alu-
minium alloy under fretting loading and taking into ac-
count the roughness impact. To evaluate the roughness
eﬀect on a simple fretting test, a cylinder/plane conﬁgu-
ration with three diﬀerent fretting pads in terms of rough-
ness, was used. After a brief description of fretting test,
material studied and surface roughness morphologies, the
crack nucleation boundary at 5.104 fretting cycles under
partial slip condition is deﬁned for the smooth contact
case. Two unidirectional surface roughnesses are succes-
sively analysed and the corresponding crack nucleation

boundary is determined. Introducing the concept of ef-
fective contact area, the diﬀerent experimental results
are rationalised through the introduction of a crack nu-
cleation master curve. Finally, applying the SWT multi-
axial fatigue criterion, prediction of the crack nucleation
is intended taking into account the size eﬀect.

EXPERIMENTAL WORK
Fretting is deﬁned as a small oscillatory movement be-
tween two bodies in contact which induce a relative dis-
placement between the two surfaces.
Considered as a
plague for modern industries, it is a very complex prob-
lem involving many aspects as tribology, contact fatigue
mechanics and material science. To reproduce such phe-
nomena, diﬀerent fretting test devices have been devel-
oped [4, 5].

Fretting experiment
The experimental setup used in this study is based on
a fretting device rigidly mounted to a servo hydraulic
test machine (see ﬁgure 2). The counter body is made of
7075T6 aluminium alloy ; the cylinder radius is 49 mm
and the cylinder length L is 4.4 mm. In cylinder plane
conﬁguration, it is helpful to deﬁne normalised loads P
and Q with respect to the contact length (eq. 1), which is
perpendicular to the sliding direction. The linear normal
load range is 100 to 1000 N/mm, equivalent to a nominal
maximum hertzian pressure from 220 MPa to 700 MPa.

Once specimen is ﬁxed and carefully aligned with the
counter body, fretting solicitation is applied during 5.104
cycles by monitoring the normal load imposed to the sur-
faces (P) and the displacement amplitude (δ) or the tan-
gential load amplitude induced by the contact (Q). For
the oscillatory parameters the stared versions (δ∗, Q∗)
denote their amplitude. After the test, an optical micro-

Surface quality
Relatively few literature can be found on the eﬀect of
roughness in fretting damage. Although a detrimental
eﬀect of the roughness is expected, some authors have
reported a great beneﬁt in term of lifetime can be ob-
tain by a special laser surface texturing [6]. In order to3
study the roughness eﬀect on the fretting crack nucle-
ation conditions, three diﬀerent cylinders named R1, R2,
R3 with increasing roughness, are used. Each counter
body is obtained by lathe machining so that roughness
is assumed unidimensional. R3 is machined with rela-
tively high speed advance of the tool, R2 is obtained
with a lower one and R1 is polished on the machine af-
ter as ﬁne as possible machining. Figure 4 presents the
three proﬁles of the fretting pads and one of a specimen
for comparison. Respective roughnesses are measured on

TRIBOLOGY ANALYSIS
A.
Fretting regime analysis and material response
maps
Two essential sliding conditions can be deﬁned: Par-
tial slip regime (PSR) characterised by a closed elliptical
fretting loop, with a composite contact of a sliding and
a sticking zone ; and Gross slip regime (GSR) identiﬁed
by a quadratic dissipative fretting loop, with full sliding
occurring over the entire contact zone [7]. The transi-
tion between one regime to another deﬁnes the Mixed
fretting regime (MFR). Identiﬁcation of this regimes in
carried out by plotting a Running Condition Fretting
Map (RCFM). Waterhouse [8] ﬁrst highlighted a corre-
lation between the sliding regime and fretting damage.
The main fretting damages can be rationalised in a Ma-
terial Response Fretting Map (MRFM) involving non-
degradation, cracking, particle detachment in a map with
normal load versus relative displacement. The fretting
description proposed by Vincent et al. [9] is based on
these two sets of fretting maps (see ﬁgure 5). When the
relative displacement of the surface is small, partial slip
prevail and induce crack initiation, although at higher
values of the displacement, gross slip settles and impose
wear of the surface.
Since in our case, partial slip is
assumed, very small displacement amplitudes have been
maintained to study the crack initiation.

Experimental fretting regimes determination
To determine the fretting regimes, variable displace-
ment method [10], has been applied for diﬀerent val-
ues of the normal load. In each test, the normal load
is kept constant.
The relative displacement start to a
very low value, imposing partial slip (with Q∗< µtP).
When stabilised conditions are reached, δ∗is increased
and maintained constant until new stabilisation is reach.
δ∗is increased this way, step by step, until the con-
tact has overcome the sliding transition conditions (i.e.
Q∗= µtP). Precise value of the transition is then cal-
culated by computing the value of the energy sliding cri-
terion A = Ed/Et ; with Ed the dissipated energy of
the corresponding cycle and Et the total energy [11, 12].
In the cylinder/plane conﬁguration, it has been shown
that the sliding transition is associated to a discontinu-
ity of ratio A (see ﬁgure 6). Figure 7 present the slid-
ing transition obtained with the variable displacement4

sus Al7075T6. On this ﬁgure, results are presented ver-
sus the relative displacement amplitude δ∗. However, it
does not appear as the more convenient representation
when diﬀerent series of results are compared.
Indeed,
the value of δ∗depends on the fretting setup compliance
[12]. Since we will use 3 diﬀerent fretting pads and dif-
ferent contact compliances, the displacement amplitude
is adequately substituted by the linear tangential force
amplitude Q∗(N/mm). Note that the tangential force is
not aﬀected by the apparatus compliance. In the next,
except if speciﬁed, results will be presented using the
tangential force.

Coeﬃcient of friction in partial slip
Under partial slip conditions, slip takes place in two
symmetrical regions a > |x| ≥c which surround a central
stick zone |x| < c. In this central zone, from Coulomb’s
law we have q(x) ≤µt × p(x). Because of the stick zone,
the friction coeﬃcient obtained at the sliding transition
cannot not used. Instead, the friction coeﬃcient in par-
tial slip regime µP S can be determined by the investiga-
tion of the scars, after the fretting tests. From Mindlin

From examination of fretting scars, the contact width
2a and the stick zone width 2c (deﬁned on ﬁgure 8) are
measured for a large range of displacement values and
the friction coeﬃcient in partial slip regime is calculated
in each case. This was done for a constant normal force
FN = 1400N (P = 318N/mm) and result is assumed to
be true wathever the value of P is for the investigated

gross slip as displacement (and so tangential force) in-
crease is well observed. Calculations of the friction co-
eﬃcient in partial slip regime with equation (3) show
clearly a constant evolution, very close to the value at
the transition. Then we can postulate that the coeﬃ-
cient of friction under studied partial slip conditions, is
identical to the value deﬁned at the transition.

A.
Methodology
For each normal load, kept constant during a test, sev-
eral fretting tests were carried out as detailed in II B,
maintaining a constant tangential force (Q∗) by mon-
itoring the displacement amplitude (δ∗).
The critical
value (Q∗
c) is precisely determined thanks to cross sec-
tion observations of specimens cut after fretting solici-
tation. Cracking is assessed by optical inspection, the
smallest observable crack being around 5µm long.
To
bracket the crack nucleation threshold, dichotomy is ap-
plied to select the values of Q∗[11]. About ten test are
required to reach a 5N accuracy in the determination of
Q∗
c. Measurement of the crack lengths allows to extrap-
olate Q∗
c even if dispersion can sometimes disturb the
method. This methodology is illustrated in ﬁgure 10.
B.
Results with a smooth contact
The described methodology is applied with R1 counter
body for 5 normal forces and crack nucleation bound-
ary is determined (ﬁgure 11). In addition, Several other
conclusions can be derived from experimental observa-
tions. First of all, the crack nucleation is always located
near the trailing edge of the contact, which is in agree-
ment with former fretting studies in partial slip regimes.
When crack initiation is detected, the crack angle is mea-
sured and is found to be lower than 35 degrees for all the
loading conditions investigated. Referring to the work of
Lamacq [14] and Dubourg and Lamacq[15], cracks seems
to growth under mode II by maximal shear amplitude.
Figure 11 shows that the threshold tangential load is
found independent of the normal force, giving:

ROUGHNESS IMPACT
In this section, results with rough surfaces are pre-
sented and compared. As expected, signiﬁcant gaps are
observed between each crack nucleation boundary. The
eﬀective contact area concept is introduced in order to
account for the roughness.
Finally, a new representa-
tion is introduced which rationalises the diﬀerent crack
boundaries obtained for diﬀerent roughnesses.6
A.
Results with rough contacts
Mean and total values of fretting pads roughness were
presented in table III. The same methods as used in para-
graph III B, for determining the sliding transition and
in paragraph IV B for establishing the crack nucleation
boundary, were used with the fretting pads of roughness
R2 and R3. The corresponding results are shown in ﬁg-
ures 12 and 13. On ﬁg. 12 it can be seen that the sliding
transition does not depends on the roughness value. This
could be expected since gross slip condition is imposed at
the transition, which induce wear in the contact. Rough-
ness is then blurred in a few cycles; and the contact in-
terface tends to a unique structure. On the contrary, the

crack initiation, under stabilised partial slip condition,
strongly depends on the surface roughness (ﬁgure 13).
As expected, a higher roughness leads to a lower tan-
gential threshold load. Fig 13 also shows a slope in the
experimental boundaries obtained with R2 and R3. This
inﬂuence of the normal force on the tangential thresh-
old load was not observed with R1. Those diﬀerences in
tangential load threshold can be explained in considering
intrinsic contact parameters. Indeed, the observation of
fretting scars (ﬁgure 14), clearly shows that for identical
loading conditions, the fretting pad surface in contact
varies with the surface roughness. This implies diﬀerent
loading conditions inside the contact, depending on the
area eﬀectively involved in the contact.
B.
Deﬁnition of the eﬀective contact area
First developed by Greenwood [16], the eﬀective con-
tact area Seff can be simpliﬁed in our case. Considering
the polished surfaces of the specimens and the unidimen-
sional fretting pad roughness, Seff is easily deﬁned as the
sum of the micro-rectangles of the pad indentation. This
deﬁnition can be one more time simpliﬁed by 2a × Leff
where Leff is the sum of the micro-length of indentation

on the medium line of the contact (ﬁgure 15). This rather
simplistic deﬁnition is only valid for well aligned contact.
Next step is to quantify the inﬂuence of FN and FT on
Leff. Eﬀective contact lengths were measured from opti-
cal images of fretting scars after the tests. Results clearly
show a negligible inﬂuence of tangential load so that Leff
appears mainly monitored by the normal load. A linear
dependence of Seff with FN is observed ; the quasi hori-
zontal curve obtained for R1 shows that Seff = S in the
investigated loading range (ﬁgure 16).
C.
Uniﬁcation of the fretting crack nucleation
boundary
Two new loading parameters Peff and Qeff, respec-
tively the eﬀective normal load and the eﬀective tangen-
tial load are introduced :
Peff = FN
Leff
and Qeff = FT
Leff
(6)
Fig. 16 gives the evolution of Leff with FN. Assuming
a negligible impact of the tangential force on Leff, the
values of Peff and Qeff can be computed. All the fret-
ting tests deﬁning the three nucleation boundaries can
then be plotted in terms of the intrinsic contact loading
parameters Peff and Qeff. The corresponding represen-
tation is presented on ﬁgure 17. On this ﬁgure, compared
to the ﬁg. 13, the crack nucleation boundary under par-
tial slip conditions appears independant of the roughness
value (for the experimental conditions investigated). Ac-
cessing intrinsic contact loading parameter was successful
in correlating the three experimental boundaries. One
point further reinforce this correlation: in ﬁg. 13, the
slope with R2 is larger than with R3 even if the rough-
ness is lower. Figure 16 shows that the slope in the Leff
evolution with FN is larger for R2 than for R3. This re-
sult might seem incoherent with the fact that zero slope
is expected for a perfectly smooth contact. However it7

could be explained by a diﬀerent response of roughness
to indentation induced by the quite diﬀerent shapes of
the roughness proﬁles shown on ﬁg.

This outlines
the diﬃculty to rationalise a surface morphology by only
considering the two parameters Ra and Rt. In any case,
the larger slope observed for the Leff R2(FN) curve per-
fectly accounts for the good correlation observed on ﬁgure
17 and highlights the physical reliability of the approach.
To summarise ﬁg. 17, it is shown here that the crack ini-
tiation of the 2024 alloy studied depends on the real lo-
cal stress state (Peff, Qeff), which cannot be calculated
without considering the real contact length Leff, in case
of a rough contact. It is also shown here that considering
the eﬀective loading parameters have removed the eﬀect

FRETTING CRACK INITIATION
PREDICTION WITH SWT PARAMETER
To predict the crack nucleation risk and formalise the
previous experiments, the SWT multiaxial fatigue cri-
terion is implemented and combined with a Mindlin de-
scription of the cylinder/plane contact conﬁguration. Ex-
plicit formulation will provide a physical justiﬁcation to
a non dependence of the crack initiation boundary with
respect to the normal load. Size eﬀect is also introduced
and implemented. It should be noted that alternative ap-
proaches like combining classical fracture mechanics and
notch fatigue can also be used to tackle this problem.8

A.
Theoretical background
The SWT critical plane approach was ﬁrst used to
tackle fretting problems by Szolwinski and Farris [1].
They used a fatigue approach developed by Smith et al.
[18] which was developed to account for a mean stress or
strain eﬀect in classical fatigue. According to the Szol-
winski and Farris approach, the crack initiation in fret-
ting occurs on the plane where the product of the nor-
mal strain amplitude ǫa, and the maximum normal stress
σmax is maximum. The SWT parameter Γ can then be
expressed as:
Γ = σmax × ǫa =
(σ′
f)2
E
(2N)2b′ + σ′
fǫ′
f(2N)b′+c′
(7)
where σ′
f is the fatigue strength coeﬃcient, b′ is the fa-
tigue strain exponent, ǫ′
f is the fatigue ductility coef-
ﬁcient, c’ is the fatigue ductility exponent and N the
number of reversal to failure. These constants are also
given by Szolwinski et al. [19] and listed in table IV.
To normalise the crack nucleation risk, the following

scalar parameter dSWT can be introduced :
dSWT =
max(σmax × ǫa)
(σ′
f )2
E
(2N)2b′ + σ′
fǫ′
f(2N)b′+c′
(8)
If dSWT is greater than or equal to 1, cracking is likely
to occur. If dSWT is less than 1, there is no risk of crack-
ing.
By expressing analytically σmax and ǫa, a literal
expression of the cracking risk dSWT can be obtained.
Fouvry [12] and Fridrici [20] showed that the SWT multi-
axial fatigue criteria application on fretting contact gives
a maximum crack initiation risk a the trailing edge of the
contact. This is in agreement with our experimental ob-
servations. We can therefore express the surface stresses
at the contact border in partial slip with Mindlin theory.
Assuming an elastic plane strain 2D state, we use the
general equation [21] :

(18)
The critical linear tangential force amplitude is propor-
tional to the cylinder radius, a function of the elastic and
fatigue properties of the material and inversely propor-
tional to the friction coeﬃcient. It must be pointed out
that Q∗
c does not depend on the normal force which ac-
count for the observed negligible impact of the pressure
ﬁeld on crack nucleation. Performing a numerical appli-
cation leads to Q∗
c = 106N/mm, value to be compared
with the experimental threshold of 240 N/mm. This dif-
ference could be related to the large stress/strain gradi-
ents which exists in and below the contact region.
Although this approach gives a theoretical justiﬁcation of
the normal load non dependance, it cannot predict the
exact threshold tangential load. Indeed, fretting crack
initiation behaviour may also depend on the severity of
the stress/strain gradients, and not only on the maximum
values. First introduced by Fouvry et al. [12, 22], the
crack nucleation process volume was successively adapted
by Araujo and Nowell [23] and more recently used by
Naboulsi and Mall [24]. In this approach, the compu-
tation of a representative SWT critical plane parame-
ter must be conducted from an averaged stress strain
state, deﬁned over an intrinsic processing material vol-
ume. Hence, the stress gradient eﬀect is indirectly con-
trolled through the averaging process.
B.
Crack nucleation process volume approach
To compute the SWT parameter using the process
volume approach, a cross section is discretised and par-
tial slip stresses and strains corresponding to the experi-
mental conditions, are computed from Mindlin solutions.

FIG. 18: Schematic representation of the radial shape process
volume averaging.
Process volume averaging is then applied considering a
radial shape volume as shown on ﬁgure 18. The SWT
crack initiation parameter is then computed from these
averaged values which gives a mean SWT value on the
process volume. As discussed in [24], SWT could be com-
puted on each point, the averaging procedure occurring
thereafter ; but the result would not be very diﬀerent
and the ﬁrst method, which is faster, has more physi-
cal meaning. From these computations, the critical lo-
cations where cracking risk is maximum, is located at
the contact surface in the vicinity of the trailing edge.
This matches the experimental observations seen in sec-
tion IV.
However if the crack location at the trailing
edge is well predicted, the SWT parameter does not pre-
dict the observed crack initiation angle (≤35 degrees).
All the values are closed to 90 degrees, perpendicular to
the maximum principal stress. Indeed, mainly dependent
on the tensile stress and strain state, the SWT param-
eter is unable to describe the shear mechanisms which
presently control the crack nucleation process. The pro-
cess volume has been identiﬁed for a linear eﬀective force
of 380 N/mm. Figure 19 displays the surface distribution
of the cracking risk dSWT deﬁned in equation (8), for dif-
ferent averaging length scale values. Experimental cor-
relation with the crack nucleation boundary is obtained
for a r = 80µm process volume radius. This value match
very well the mean grain size radius of 75µm, and con-
sequently conﬁrms a correlation between the mechanical
crack nucleation process volume and the microstructure.
With the process volume radius ﬁxed, by varying normal
load in the computation analysis, one can draw the ana-
lytic crack initiation boundary predicted with SWT pa-
rameter. This is compared to the experimental boundary
on ﬁg. 20 and plot in the eﬀective loads representation.10

discussion
Obviously, ﬁgure 20 conﬁrms that SWT computations
with a r = 80µm process volume radius allows to predict
the studied 240 N/mm linear normal loading. Although
a weak inﬂuence of the normal load is observed, it is
nevertheless deduced that the application of a singular
process volume radius is ineﬀective to quantify the pres-
sure impact. Indeed, in the SWT formulation, pressure
eﬀect have tendency to reduce the cracking risk which
is based on tensile stress, although the contrary is ob-
served experimentally. Thus the physical meaning of the
SWT parameter to predict the 2024T351 fretting crack
initiation appears discutable. Other criteria, more repre-
sentative of the physical behaviour of the studied alloy,
should be studied involving elasto-plastic analyses of the
stress/strain loading path.
D.
Identiﬁcation of a safe crack nucleation process
volume
The results presented above show that analytical cal-
culations coupled with the process volume approach and
the SWT criterion are limited for predicting the experi-
mental crack nucleation boundary. However, due to the
simplicity of its formulation, it is widely employed in in-
dustrial component conception. An alternative method
to reach a safe prediction for crack initiation in contact
submitted to fretting loading, is presently introduced.
First, the contact pressure range must be deﬁned. Then
the process volume is evaluated for both Pmin and Pmax.
Assuming a monotonous evolution between Pmin and
Pmax, the safe crack nucleation process volume rs is de-
ﬁned as :
rs = Min[r(Pmax), r(Pmin)]
(19)
In the present case, a positive slope with the pressure

increase has been identiﬁed. Therefore we can directly
assume that the safe crack nucleation process volume
correspond to the process volume deﬁned for Pmax, the
maximum pressure loading. Setting Pmax to 1000N/mm
leads to a critical value of r = 70µm which can be used to
deﬁne the safety domain (see ﬁgure 21). It is important
to mention that the obtained process volume is very close
to the value previously deﬁned for the minimal pressure.
Again, it conﬁrms the stability of the approach and sup-
port the idea of a reliable grain size averaging approach.

CONCLUSION
Fretting crack initiation under partial slip conditions
is investigated through an experimental approach and11
the eﬀect of roughness is studied quantitatively.
Alu-
minium alloys contact, under cylinder/plane conﬁgura-
tion is studied in order to tackle crack initiation in riv-
eted assemblies. Three fretting pads are used with tree
diﬀerent surface qualities, with a unidimensional rough-
ness morphology.
First, the running condition fretting map is determined
and the friction law is quantiﬁed. the friction coeﬃcient
in partial slip is demonstrated to be equal to the friction
coeﬃcient at the transition µt = 1.1. The sliding tran-
sition appears to be independent of the roughness value,
which could be explained by a rapid blurring of the in-
cipient surface roughness under gross slip conditions.
Further work has been undertaken to determine the ex-
perimental crack nucleation boundaries with respect to
the surface roughness. Results have shown that a critical
tangential load could be found with a smooth contact,
although a weak pressure eﬀect is observed for the two
rough contacts.
As expected, crack initiation appears
very sensitive to the surface quality, a higher roughness
leading to a lower value of the tangential force needed for
crack initiation. A contact eﬀective area formulation is
introduced in order to access the intrinsic contact load-
ing parameters. Linear normal and tangential eﬀective
loads Peff and Qeff are computed and a new represen-
tation is drawn to describe the crack nucleation bound-
aries.
This is successfully applied to correlate experi-
mental results and various crack nucleation boundaries
are uniﬁed independently of the surface quality leading
to Q∗
effc = 240N/mm.
An analytical justiﬁcation of the weak dependence of
Q∗
c to the normal load for a smooth contact has been
conducted.
SWT criterion has been formulated in or-
der to predict the crack nucleation threshold. The non
inﬂuence of the normal load on crack nucleation thresh-
old is justiﬁed although the numerical application ap-
pears to be on the safe side. A radial process volume ap-
proach is then introduced to take into account the severe
stress/strain gradient in the contact. A global correla-
tion is found with the experimental results with a pro-
cess volume diameter which match the mean grain radius
of 75 µm and thus, this eﬀect could be correlated to a
stress/strain microstructure accommodation. In spite of
this, the pressure eﬀect on the crack nucleation bound-
ary, is not in agreement with experimental results. To
avoid a large underestimation of the cracking risk, a safe
crack nucleation process volume identiﬁcation approach
is introduced.
It consists in deﬁning the smallest vol-
ume through the investigated pressure and contact size
ranges.
However, some critical aspects like the pressure loading
impact or the incipient crack orientation suggests that
other fatigue approaches must be considered and elasto-
plastic stress/strain analysis are required.
