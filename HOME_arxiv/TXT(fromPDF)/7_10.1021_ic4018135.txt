We have synthesized a new layered BiS2-based compound SrFBiS2. This compound has similar
structure to BiS2.
It is built up by stacking up SrF layers and NaCl-type BiS2 layers alterna-
tively along the c axis. Electric transport measurement indicates that SrFBiS2 is a semiconductor.
Thermal transport measurement shows that SrFBiS2 has a small thermal conductivity and large
Seebeck coeﬃcient. First principle calculations are in agreement with experimental results and show
that SrFBiS2 is very similar to LaOBiS2 which becomes superconductor with F doping. Therefore,
SrFBiS2 may be a parent compound of new superconductors.

INTRODUCTION
Low-dimensional superconductors with layered struc-
ture have been extensively studied and still attract
much interest due to their exotic superconducting prop-
erties and mechanism when compared to conventional
BCS superconductors.
The examples include high Tc
cuprates,1 Sr2RuO4,2 NaxCoO2·H2O,3 and iron-based
superconductors.4 The discovery of LnOFePn (Ln =
rare earth elements, Pn = P, As) in particular revi-
talises the study of layered compounds with mixed an-
ions, paving a way to materials with novel physical prop-
erties. For example, Ln2O2TM2OCh2 (TM = transition
metals, Ch = S, Se) show strong electron-electron in-
teractions and Mott insulating state on the two dimen-
sional (2D) frustrated antiferromagnetic (AFM) checker-
board spin-lattice.5−9 Very recently, bulk superconduc-
tivity was found in BiS2-type layered compounds with
mixed anions: Bi4O4S3 and Ln(O,F)BiS2.10−12 Exper-
imental and theoretical studies indicate that these ma-
terials exhibit multiband behaviors with dominant elec-
tron carriers originating from the Bi 6px and 6py bands
in the normal state.13−16 On the other hand, com-
pounds with mixed anions exhibit remarkable ﬂexibil-
ity of structure. Diﬀerent two-dimensional (2D) build-
ing blocks, such as [LnO]+, [AEF]+ (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba),
[Ti2OPn2]2−, [FePn]−, and [TM2OCh2]2−, can some-
times be integrated to form new materials.4,17−21 In-
dividual building blocks often keep their structural and
electronic properties after being combined together.19
In this work, we report the discovery of a new BiS2-
based layered compound SrFBiS2. It contains NaCl-type
BiS2 layer and shows semiconducting behavior with rel-
atively large thermopower. Theoretical calculation indi-
cates that this compound is very similar to LnOBiS2.

EXPERIMENT
A.
Synthesis.
SrFBiS2 polycrystals were synthesized by a two-step
solids state reaction. First, Bi2S3 was prereacted by re-
acting Bi needles (purity 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) with sulfur
ﬂakes (purity 99.99%, Aldrich) in an evacuated quartz
tube at 600 ◦C for 10 h. Then Bi2S3 was mixed with stoi-
chiometric SrF2 (purity 99%, Alfa Aesar) and SrS (purity
99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and intimately ground together using
an agate pestle and mortar.
The ground powder was
pressed into 10 mm diameter pellets. We used a maxi-
mum pressure of 5 tons. The pressed pellet was loaded in
an alumina crucible and then sealed in quartz tubes with
Ar under the pressure of 0.15 atmosphere. The quartz
tubes were heated up to 600 ◦C in 10 h and kept at 600
◦C for another 10 h.
B.
Structure and Composition Analysis.
Phase identity and purity were conﬁrmed by powder
X-ray diﬀraction carried out by a Rigaku Miniﬂex X-ray
machine with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 ˚A). Structural
reﬁnement of powder SrFBiS2 sample was carried out by
using Rietica software.22 Synchrotron X-ray experiment
was conducted at 300 K on X17A beamline of the Na-
tional Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL). The setup utilized X-ray
beam 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm in size and λ = 0.1839 ˚A (E =
67.4959 keV), conditioned by two-axis focusing with one-
bounce sagittally-bent Laue crystal monochromator, and
Perkin-Elmer image plate detector mounted perpendicu-
lar to the primary beam path. Finely pulverized sample
packed in cylindrical polyimide capillary 1mm in diame-
ter was placed 204 mm away from the detector. Multiple
scans were performed to a total exposure time of 120 s.
The 2D diﬀraction data were integrated and converted
to intensity versus 2θ using the software FIT2D.23 The
intensity data were corrected and normalized and con-
verted to atomic pair distribution function (PDF), G(r),
using the program PDFgetX2.24 The average stoichiom-
etry of SrFBiS2 polycrystal was determined by examina-
tion of multiple points using an energy-dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) in a JEOL JSM-6500 scanning elec-
tron microscope.2
C.
Electrical and Thermal Transport
Measurements.
The sample pellets were cut into rectangular bar and
the surface is polished by sandpaper.
Thin Pt wires
were attached using silver epoxy for four probe resistiv-
ity measurements. Electrical and thermal transport mea-
surements were carried out in Quantum Design Physical
Property Measurement System (PPMS-9).
D.
Band Structure Calculations.
First principle electronic structure calculation were
performed using experimental crystallographic param-
eters within the full-potential linearized augmented
plane wave (LAPW) method25 implemented in WIEN2k
package.26 The general gradient approximation (GGA)
of Perdew et al.,27 was used for exchange-correlation po-
tential. The LAPW sphere radius were set to 2.5 Bohr
for all atoms, and the converged basis corresponding to
Rminkmax = 7 with additional local orbital were used
where Rmin is the minimum LAPW sphere radius and
kmax is the plane wave cutoﬀ.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Structure and Compostion.
Fig. 1(a) shows the powder XRD pattern of SrFBiS2
measured by Rigaku Miniﬂex. Almost all of reﬂections
can be indexed using the P4/nmm space group.
The
unidentiﬁed peaks belong to the second phase of Bi2S3.
Using two-phase Le Bail ﬁtting, the reﬁned lattice param-
eters of SrFBiS2 are a = 4.084(2) ˚A and c = 13.798(2)
˚A. When compared to LaOBiS2, the a-axial lattice pa-
rameter is larger and the c-axial one is slightly smaller.11
The PDF structural analysis was carried out using the
program PDFgui.28 The SrFBiS2 data are explained well
within the model having P4/nmm symmetry with a =
4.079(2) ˚A and c = 13.814(5) ˚A(Rwp = 0.138, χ2=0.024).
It is consistent with the ﬁtting results obtained from
Miniﬂex. The ﬁnal ﬁt is shown in Fig. 1(b), and the
results are summarized in Table 1. In addition to the
principal phase, the sample is found to have ∼16(1) wt%
of Bi2S3 impurity with Pnma symmetry, which is also ob-
served in Fig. 1(a). Structure of SrFBiS2 is similar to
LaOBiS2, which is built up by stacking the rock-salt-type
BiS2 layer and ﬂuorite-type SrF layer alternatively along
the c axis as shown Fig. 1(c). The EDX spectrum of
polycrystal conﬁrms the presence of Sr, F, Bi, and S.
The average atomic ratios determined from EDX are Sr
: F : Bi : S = 1.00(4) : 1.00(9) : 1.03(5) : 1.88(4) when
setting the content of Sr as 1. It conﬁrms the formula of
obtained compound is SrFBiS2.

Electrical Properties.
As shown in Fig. 2, the resistivity ρ(T ) of SrFBiS2
polycrystalline shows a semiconducting behavior in the
measured temperature region (1.9-300 K). It should be
noted that Bi2S3 polycrystal shows metallic behavior
becasue of sulfur deﬁciency.29 The impurity may have
some minor inﬂuence on the absolute value of resis-3

tivity, but the semiconducting behavior should be in-
trinsic.
Neglecting the grain boundary contribution,
the room-temperature resistivity ρ(300 K) is about 0.5
Ω·cm.
Using the thermal activation model ρab(T ) =
ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT ) (ρ0 is a prefactor, Ea thermal activated
energy and kB the Boltzmann’s constant) to ﬁt the ρ(T )
at high temperature (75 K - 300 K) (inset of Fig. 2),
we obtain Ea = 31.8(3) meV. The semiconductor be-
havior is consistent with theoretical calculation result
shown below.
On the other hand, theoretical calcula-
tions have indicated that undoped LaOBiS2 is also a
semiconductor, which is partially consistent with the ex-
perimental result.13,30 Transport measurement indicates
that LaOBiS2 shows semiconducting behavior at T < 200
K, but exhibit an upturn of resistivity at higher temper-
ature. The origin of the upturn is unclear. Therefore,
the replacement of LaO by SrF should not change the
band structure and thus physical properties too much,
especially at low temperature, similar to the relation be-
tween SrFFeAs and LaOFeAs.18,31 The slight diﬀerences
between LaOBiS2 and SrFBiS2, such as larger a-axial and
smaller c-axial lattice parameters, could result in chang-
ing of physical properties at higher temperature. Note
that the semiconducting ρ(T ) in LaOBiS2 and SrFBiS2
are diﬀerent from those in parent compounds of iron pnic-
tide superconductors. The latter show metallic behaviors
at high temperature and semiconducting-like upturn in
resistivity curve related to the spin density wave (SDW)
transition. There is no signiﬁcant magnetoresistance in
SrFBiS2 up to 90 kOe magnetic ﬁeld.
C.
Thermal Transport Properties.
The temperature dependences of the thermal conduc-
tivity κ(T ) and thermoelectric power (TEP) S(T ) for
SrFBiS2 in zero ﬁeld between 2 and 350 K are shown in
Fig. 3. The electronic thermal conductivity κe(T ) esti-
mated from the Wiedemann-Franz law using a value for
the Lorenz number of 2.44×10−8 W Ω/K2 was less than
5×10−6 of κ(T ). Therefore, lattice thermal conductivity
dominates κL(T ) which exhibits a peak at around 60 K
(Fig. 1(a)). The peak in κ(T ) commonly arises since dif-
ferent phonon scattering processes usually dominate in
diﬀerent temperature ranges. Umklapp scattering dom-
inates at high temperatures, while boundary and point-
defect scattering dominate at low and intermediate tem-4

peratures, respectively.32 On the other hand, the κ(T ) of
SrFBiS2 shows similar behavior to Bi4O4S3 but with dif-
ferent peak position and absolute value.16 For TEP S(T )
of SrFBiS2, there is a reversal in sign at about 11 K, i.e,
hole-like carrier changes into electron-like carrier which is
dominant at room temperature. According to two band
model, S = |Sh|σh −|Se|σe/(σe + σh).16 If we assume
that Sh and Se are temperature independent, it suggests
that electron and hole conductivities change dramatically
with temperature: at low temperature, σh > σe whereas
σe > σh above 11 K. Hole-like carrier may originate from
defect induced p-type doping. With increasing temper-
ature, electron-like carrier due to intrinsic band excita-
tion increase signiﬁcantly, ﬁnally leading to σe > σh and
a sign change in S(T ). Similar behavior was observed
in LaOZnP and p-type Si.33,34 Even though the S(T )
in SrFBiS2 is signiﬁcant and not much smaller than in
classics thermoelectric materials,35 its low electrical con-
ductivity makes its ﬁgure of merit ZT (ZT = σS2T/κ)
extremely small.
D.
Electronic Structure.
First principle calculations (Fig.
4) conﬁrm that
SrFBiS2 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of
0.8 eV located at X point. This is similar to LaOBiS2
where the energy gap was found to be 0.82 eV.36 The
calculation conﬁrms the results of transport measure-
ment.
Similar to LaOBiS2,13,36 both S 3p and Bi 6p
states are located around the Fermi level (-2.0 to 2.0 eV)
in SrFBiS2. Thus there is a strong hybridization between
S 3p and Bi 6p states. The absence of dispersion along
Γ −Z line suggests quasi two dimensional character of
the band structure in SrFBiS2 (Fig. 4(b)). In LaOBiS2,
F doping results in metallic states and superconductiv-
ity at low temperature. Main inﬂuence of F substitution
is a carrier doping that shifts the Fermi level and has
only minor eﬀect on the lowest conduction band. Due to
similarity between SrFBiS2 and LaOBiS2, new supercon-

ductors could be obtained by chemical substitution.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we report a discovery of a new layered
ﬂuorosulﬁde SrFBiS2. It contains NaCl-type BiS2 layer
similar to Bi4O4S3 and Ln(O,F)BiS2 superconductors.
SrFBiS2 polycrystals shows semiconducting behavior be-
tween 2 K and 300 K. We observe rather small thermal
conductivity and large TEP with sign reversal at low
temperature. Theoretical calculation conﬁrms the semi-
conducting behavior and indicates similar DOS and band
structure to undoped LaOBiS2. Because of the similarity
between SrFBiS2 and the parent compound of BiS2-based
superconductors, it is of interest to investigate the dop-
ing eﬀects on physical properties of SrFBiS2. It could
pave a way to new members in this emerging family of5
BiS2-based superconductors.
