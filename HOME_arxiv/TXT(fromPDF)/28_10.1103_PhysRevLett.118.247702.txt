The photovoltaic reciprocity theory relates the electroluminescence spectrum of a solar cell under
applied bias to the external photovoltaic quantum eﬃciency of the device as measured at short
circuit conditions. Its derivation is based on detailed balance relations between local absorption and
emission rates in optically isotropic media with non-degenerate quasi-equilibrium carrier distribu-
tions. In many cases, the dependence of density and spatial variation of electronic and optical device
states on the point of operation is modest and the reciprocity relation holds. In nanostructure-based
photovoltaic devices exploiting conﬁned modes, however, the underlying assumptions are no longer
justiﬁable. In the case of ultrathin absorber solar cells, the modiﬁcation of the electronic struc-
ture with applied bias is signiﬁcant due to the large variation of the built-in ﬁeld. Straightforward
use of the external quantum eﬃciency as measured at short circuit conditions in the photovoltaic
reciprocity theory thus fails to reproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias
voltage. This failure is demonstrated here by numerical simulation of both spectral quantities at
normal incidence and emission for an ultrathin GaAs p-i-n solar cell using an advanced quantum
kinetic formalism based on non-equilibrium Green’s functions of coupled photons and charge car-
riers. While coinciding with the semiclassical relations under the conditions of their validity, the
theory provides a consistent microscopic relationship between absorption, emission and charge car-
rier transport in photovoltaic devices at arbitrary operating conditions and for any shape of optical
and electronic density of states.
Absorption and emission of light by a semiconductor
material are two physical processes that are related by
the fundamental laws of light-matter coupling.
For a
given set of electronic states connected by an optical tran-
sition, the two processes are described in terms of iden-
tical optical matrix elements and joint density of elec-
tronic states participating in the transition. In thermal
equilibrium, the principle of detailed balance dictates a
vanishing net transition rate. On these grounds, the ab-
sorption coeﬃcient has been related to the radiative life-
time of charge carriers under non-equilibrium conditions
[1], and to the local emission spectrum at ﬁnite splitting
of quasi-Fermi levels [2]. In the ﬁrst case, the absorption
coeﬃcient α determines the prefactor B of the local rate
of radiative recombination R(r) = B(r)ρn(r)ρp(r)/n2
i via
B(r) =

where Eγ = ℏω is the photon energy, ρn(p) and ni de-
note the electron (hole) and intrinsic carrier densities,
respectively, nr is the local refractive index – approx-
imated as independent of energy – and ¯φbb ≡4πφbb

fBE(Eγ) = {exp[βEγ] −1}−1 (β ≡{kBT}−1) the Bose-
Einstein distribution function at emitter temperature T.
In the second case, a generalization of the Planck emis-
sion law is given by the following rate (per unit volume):
RGP(r, Eγ, ∆µ) = α(r, Eγ) ¯Dγ

c0
nr(r)fBE(Eγ −∆µ),
(2)
where ¯Dγ
0 is the angle-integrated density of photon states
and ∆µ denotes the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS).
In Ref. 2, this result was derived under the assumption of
unrestricted optical transitions (no momentum selection
rule), of quasi-equilibrium occupation described by Fermi
statistics with distinct and constant (bulk) quasi-Fermi
levels for electrons and holes, and of an optically homo-
geneous medium exhibiting a photon density of states for
free ﬁeld modes, ¯Dγ
0(r, Eγ) = (E2
γn3
r)/(π2ℏ3c3
0). The two
cases coincide if Boltzmann statistics are used for the
carrier densities in Ref. 1 and substituted for the Bose
factor in (2), which is often found in literature, though
strictly valid only at high temperature and far from de-
generacy. Expression (2) constitutes one of the main in-
gredients of the photovoltaic reciprocity theory as formu-
lated in Ref. 3, which relates the luminescent emission of
a solar cell under applied bias voltage to the external
quantum eﬃciency QPV of the same device under illumi-
nation, and which has found widespread application in
luminescence-based characterization of photovoltaic ma-
terials, cells and modules [4–7]. For the case of an applied
electrical bias V and a QPV that is determined at nor-
mal incidence and short circuit conditions (V = 0), this
reciprocity relation reads [3]

The limits for the applicability of the photovoltaic reci-
procity relation as encoded in Expr. (3) have been inves-
tigated for diﬀerent situations where some of the basic
assumptions - such as, the superposition principle or the
Donolato theorem [8] - do not hold [9–12]. For instance,
in Ref. 11, numerical device simulations were used to
show the failure of the reciprocity relation in the case of
non-identical band diagrams in the dark and under illu-

mination. However, these numerical experiments are lim-
ited by the validity of the underlying description of the
photovoltaic device operation, which has thus far been
restricted to semiclassical bulk physics.
On the other
hand, there is a range of photovoltaic device architec-
tures under active development where this conventional
bulk picture is no longer appropriate as it fails to reﬂect
the dependence of the microscopic electronic structure on
the operating point of the device, such as nanostructure-
based and ultra-thin solar cells [13, 14]. In this Letter,
we therefore assess the validity of Eqs.
(2) and (3) if
applied to ultra-thin solar cells by comparison with the
quantum-kinetic picture of radiative charge carrier gener-
ation, transport and recombination as formulated within
the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) formalism
[15–17]. To this end, the coupled NEGF problems of in-
teracting electrons and photons are solved - for the ﬁrst
time - for a realistic solar cell device exhibiting a com-
plex potential proﬁle, such as the ultra-thin GaAs p-i-n
structure displayed in Fig. 1.
In the case of a planar absorber, the local NEGF ex-
pressions for the spectral radiative rates (per unit vol-
ume, z: depth) read [18, 19]

In the above equations, q∥is the transverse – i.e., in-plane
– component of the photon wave vector, D denotes the
transverse photon Green’s function and Π is the trans-
verse photon self-energy tensor related to the polariza-
tion of the electronic system [20]. These expressions pro-
vide a general microscopic relation between local absorp-
tion and emission rates in terms of occupied photon and
electron-hole pair states (D<, Π<) and the correspond-
ing ﬁnal state spectral functions (ˆΠ ≡Π> −Π<, ˆD ≡
D> −D<). The expressions are valid for arbitrary shape
of the density of states and nonequilibrium occupation
corresponding to the actual operating point of the struc-
ture under optical or electronic excitation.
For the comparison with the semiclassical quasi-
equilibrium result (2), several approximations corre-
sponding to the restricted regime of validity of the latter
are applied to (5) and (6). In the case of the absorption,
coupling to a coherent radiation ﬁeld permits to replace
the photon GF by the electromagnetic vector potential

Equation (8) formally deﬁnes the local and modal ab-

the local value of the photon ﬂux Φ. For slow variation of
the transverse electromagnetic ﬁeld in the absorber, the

Expr. (2). At this point, however, it needs to be empha-
sized that the two polarization function components en-
tering expressions (10) and (11) are computed on the ba-
sis of the same electronic GF, which in turn may depend
strongly on the point of operation. As shown in Fig. 2
displaying the absorption coeﬃcient and spectral emis-
sion rate in the center of the intrinsic region of a 100 nm
GaAs p-i-n photodiode, this is indeed the case for ultra-
thin absorber solar cells: due to the strong impact of the
built-in ﬁeld on the local absorption coeﬃcient [13], the
emission spectrum at V = 1 V based on the generalized
Planck (GP) law (2) – ¯RGP
em – does only coincide with the
one obtained from the isotropic NEGF expression (11) –
¯RNEGF
em
– if the absorption coeﬃcient at V = 1 V is used.
In contrast, the GP emission spectrum based on the ab-
sorption coeﬃcient at short circuit conditions (V = 0 V)
shows a strong ﬁeld-induced red-shift and broadening as
compared to the NEGF spectrum.
Since the validity of the GP law is an essential req-
uisite for the photovoltaic reciprocity relation to hold,
the above ﬁnding has severe consequences for the appli-
cability of Expr. (3) to the case of the ultrathin solar
cells under consideration, as QPV is conventionally de-
ﬁned at zero applied bias voltage where it provides the
short circuit current Jsc under the action of the external
illumination spectrum. However, for a proper assessment
of Expr. (3), the local relation (2) between absorption
and emission ﬁrst needs to be propagated to the global
relation between QPV and the emitted photon ﬂux φem
at the surface of the device. To this end, in addition to
the local dynamics, knowledge of the propagation of light
inside the cell is required. This information is encoded
in the NEGF version of the Poynting vector component

In the above expression, b characterizes the global

ﬂuctuations and n is the distribution function of incident

state is given by

Under the assumption of com-
plete isotropy, the absorptance obeys aµν(q∥, Eγ) ≡
¯a(Eγ)δµν cos θ/2 for q∥= q0 sin θ with q0 = Eγ/(ℏc0).
In the case of global quasi-equilibrium characterized by a
QFLS ∆µ = µn−µp, the distribution of medium-induced
excitations amounts to the corresponding Bose-Einstein
function, bµν(q∥, Eγ) ≡fBE(Eγ −∆µ), and the integra-
tion in (17) is restricted to the absorptance. Hence, us-
ing Expr. (17) for vanishing incident radiation ﬁeld – i.e.,
n ≡0 – Expr. (16) for emission into air becomes

For the ultra-thin solar cell considered here, the global

cally constant QFLS throughout the absorber – are well
met, as can be inferred from Fig. 1.

obtained from the NEGF carrier densities ρ and spec-

Dirac distribution function at lattice temperature T and
the upper (lower) sign is for electrons (holes). The tiny

bility and the absence of fast recombination processes,
and leads to the equivalence QPV ≡a, as shown in
Ref. 19, where the short circuit current under monochro-
matic illumination is compared to the photocurrent ob-
tained from the absorptance. The spectral rate of photon

this point, it is interesting to note that while the global

cal rate (4) gives the radiative dark current upon inte-
gration over photon energies, it does not coincide with

gation through the absorbing material is not accounted

In conclusion, we presented a critical assessment of the
photovoltaic reciprocity relation between external quan-
tum eﬃciency and electroluminescent emission in ultra-
thin solar cells, by application of a comprehensive non-
equilibrium quantum theory of photovoltaic device op-
eration which considers both electronic and optical de-
grees of freedom on equal footing.
The explicit rela-
tion of the macroscopic device properties to the micro-
scopic nonequilibrium charge carrier states reveals the
approximate nature of the semiclassical reciprocity the-
orem and provides at the same time a more generally
valid picture of local (GP) and global (GK) connections
between radiative processes in mesoscopic solar cell de-
vices. This is of high practical relevance for photovoltaic
devices whose characteristics are no longer determined by
the equilibrium bulk properties of the constituent mate-
rials, but by the actual nonequilibrium device state at
the operating point, as in the case of the ultrathin solar
cell architectures considered here and in a wide range of
nanostructure-based implementations of third-generation
solar cell concepts.
