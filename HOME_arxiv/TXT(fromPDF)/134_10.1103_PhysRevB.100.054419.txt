We calculate transverse spin susceptibility in the linear response method based on the ground
states determined in the quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method. Then we extract spin
wave (SW) dispersions from the susceptibility. We treat bcc Fe, hcp Co, fcc Ni, and B2-type FeCo.
Because of the better description of the independent-particle picture in QSGW, calculated spin
stiﬀness constants for Fe, Co, and Ni give much better agreement with experiments in QSGW than
that in the local density approximation (LDA), where the stiﬀness for Ni in LDA is two times
bigger than the experiment. For Co, both acoustic and optical branches of SWs agree with the
experiment.
As for FeCo, we have some discrrepancy between the spin stiﬀness in QSGW and
that in the experiment. We may need further theoretical and experimental investigations on the
discrepancy.

INTRODUCTION
Spin wave (SW) is one of the important factors to con-
trol magnetic properties of material. SW is excited at
considerably low temperature compared to room tem-
perature (RT), and its energy range typically lies in a
few hundred meV. When one magnetic moment tilted
from the parallel spin conﬁguration, the exchange in-
teraction triggers the SW propagation throughout the
material as collective excitation. We can observe SWs
in bulk materials by inelastic neutron scattering experi-
ment, e.g., in bcc Fe [1], fcc Ni [2], and even half-metals
like perovskite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 [3]. In addition to collec-
tive excitation, another magnetic excitation like spin-ﬂip
excitation is called Stoner excitation, whose excitation
energy is related to the exchange splitting ∆Ex. We can
experimentally observe Stoner excitation by the high en-
ergy experiment such as spin-polarized electron energy
loss spectroscopy (SPEELS) [4]. High energy SWs are
strongly damped because of the hybridization with the
Stoner excitation.
Let us explain how we determine the spin stiﬀness D
experimentally. From the macroscopic point of view, the
Bloch’s T
3
2 rule [5] in the temperature dependence of
magnetization M(T) is derived from the SW theory. For
the wave vector q ∼0, the SW dispersion ω(q) behaves
as ω(q) = Dq2. Since this behavior of ω(q) results in
the T
3
2 rule in low temperature, we can determine D by
analyzing the temperature dependence of magnetization
[6].

We mainly have three methods to calculate ω(q) in
the ﬁrst-principles methods. The ﬁrst one is the Lichten-
stein formula (LF) [7]. Assuming the Heisenberg model,
we calculate exchange interaction Jij or its Fourier trans-
form J(q) based on the magnetic force theorem [8]. Here
i, j are for site indices.
Then ω(q) is calculated from
J(q).
In Ref.
7, they calculated Jij up to the sec-
ond nearest neighbors, resulting in D, which are in good
agreement with experiments for Fe and Ni. Later, Pajda
et al. investigated the convergence of D for a range of
neighbors and found that converged D are in good agree-
ment with experiments for Fe but overestimated for Ni
[9].
The second one is the frozen magnon method (FMM)
[10], which assumes the Heisenberg model as in LF. In
FMM, we employ adiabatic approximation; namely, we
neglect motions of the magnetic moment compared to
electron motions. Then we calculate J(q) from the con-
straint spin-spiral conﬁgurations with the ﬁxed magni-
tude of the magnetic moment. Once we get J(q), we solve
the eigenvalue problem for deriving ω(q). This method
works well for bcc Fe [10, 11]. Note that we can not de-
scribe the decay of collective SWs (Stoner damping) in
both of these two methods.
The third one is the linear response (LR) method for
transverse spin susceptibility R+−(q, ω) [12].
The LR
method directly gives ω(q) in the reciprocal space. Cooke
et al.
ﬁrst introduced the LR method for calculating
R+−(q, ω), and they discussed Stoner damping in SWs in
bcc Fe and fcc Ni [13]. Savrasov treated spin ﬂuctuations
based on the many-body perturbation theory and repro-
duced the experimental ω(q) [14]. Karlsson and Aryase-
tiawan also calculated R+−(q, ω) based on the Green
function method [15].
From a view of computational
arXiv:1904.09093v3  [physics.comp-ph]  27 Oct 20192
eﬃciency, S¸a¸sıoˇglu et al. proposed a LR method with
maximally-localized Wannier function (MLWF) [16]. In
the method, we decrease to the second power of the num-
ber of a Wannier basis set and we can decrease the cal-
culation cost. With this eﬃcient method, they can use
ﬁne q mesh for calculating R+−(q, ω).
These three methods mainly have been applied to the
ground states given in the local density approximation
(LDA). However, the ground state given in LDA is not
necessarily good enough.
For example, Sponza et al.
shows that 3d-bandwidth and ∆Ex in LDA are not good
enough to calculate ω(q) [17]. In antiferromagnetic tran-
sition metal oxides such as NiO and MnO, the calculated
ω(q) does not agree with the experiment due to too small
∆Ex and too small bandgap [18]. Serious disagreement
is also found in the ω(q) in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, for which
LDA fails to reproduce the half-metallic electronic struc-
ture of that compound [19]. It is possible to start from
the ground states of LDA+U; however, we sometimes
have diﬃculty in determination of U. It may suggest a
limitation of LDA+U itself.
To overcome such limitations in LDA, Kotani et al.
calculated ω(q) for strongly-correlated materials in an
LR method for the ground states determined in the quasi-
particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method [18, 19].
Then we see reasonable agreement with experiments for
NiO and MnO because QSGW gives good descriptions
of the band quantities such as ∆Ex and bandgaps [20].
We expect such good agreement for wide-range of ma-
terials.
However, Kotani’s LR method used in Refs.
[18, 19] is too simple to apply a wide range of materials.
Thus we implemented the eﬃcient LR method to calcu-
late R+−(q, ω) based on the MLWF given by S¸a¸sıoˇglu
et al. [16] in QSGW calculation package ecalj compiled
by Kotani et al. [21]. We demonstrate how the method
works for typical ferromagnets such as bcc Fe, fcc Ni, hcp
Co, and B2 FeCo (CsCl structure) and we discuss the dif-
ference between LDA and QSGW. Except for FeCo, the
SWs in QSGW agree with experiments. We ﬁnd some
discrepancies for FeCo.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
A.
quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW)
Until now, varieties of GW calculations based on the
Hedin’s GW approximation [22, 23] have been performed
since it is introduced to the ﬁrst-principles calculations by
Hyberstein and Louie [24]. Most of the GW calculations
are so-called one-shot GW. Starting from G0 for the one-
body Hamiltonian in LDA HLDA
0
, we calculate correc-
tions to the eigenvalues of HLDA
0
to reproduce quasipar-
ticle energies. In the one-shot GW, the self-energy for the
corrections is given as Σ(1, 2) = iG0(1, 2)W(1+, 2), where
we use notation 1 ≡(r1, t1). The screened Coulomb in-
teraction W(1+, 2) is calculated as W = (1 −vP)−1v
from the bare Coulomb interaction v and the polariza-
tion function P = −iG0 × G0. The one-shot GW has a
shortcoming since the one-shot GW is just a perturbation
on top of HLDA
0
.
To overcome the shortcoming of the one-shot GW,
we utilize QSGW method [25–27] implemented in ecalj
package [21]. Let us summarize QSGW method. At ﬁrst,
recall the above GW procedure which can be applicable
to any static one-body Hamiltonian H0(r, r′) as
H0(r, r′) = −∇2
2 + Vext + VH + Vxc(r, r′),
(1)
where we have the external potential Vext, the Hartree
potential VH, and the non-local exchange-correlation po-
tential Vxc(r, r′).
With Σ(1, 2) = iG0(1, 2)W(1+, 2)
where G0 = 1/(ω −H0), we have the energy-dependent
one-body Hamiltonian H(r, r′; ω) as
H(r, r′; ω) = −∇2
2 + Vext + VH + Σ(r, r′; ω).
(2)
That is, GW approximation gives a procedure H0 →
H. QSGW requires “quasiparticle self-consistency”, that
is, minimization of the diﬀerence between H0 and H.
The minimization gives the procedure H →H0, replacing
the ω-dependent Σ in Eq. (2) with the static non-local
exchange-correlation potential V xc as
V xc = 1

where eigenvalues εi and eigenfunctions ψi are those of
H0. This deﬁnes a procedure to give a new H0, H →
H0. Thus we ﬁnally have a ’quasiparticle self-consistency’
cycle H0 →H →H0 →H →· · · (or G0 →G →G0 →
· · · ) until converged.
B.
Dynamical magnetic susceptibility
In LR, we follow the procedure given in Ref.
[16,
28].
Here we treat the transverse spin susceptibility
R+−(1, 2), which describes the response of the expec-
tation value of a spin density operator ˆσ+(1) to the the
external magnetic ﬁeld B−(2) as,
R+−(1, 2) = δ ⟨ˆσ+(1)⟩
δB+(2)
,
(4)
where 1 = (r1, t1). See Eq. (20) in Ref. 28. Here the
expectation value of ˆσ+(1) is given as

where G(1, 1+) is the single-particle Green function from

sider four-points representation R(4)
↑↓(12, 34). The trace
of matrix R(4)
↑↓(11, 33) leads to two-point representation
R+−(1, 2).3
In order to obtain R(4)
↑↓(12, 34), we solve the Bethe-
Salpeter equation where we use the static screened
Coulomb interaction W(1+, 2) which is ∝δ(t1 −t2). It
is

(particle-hole with opposite spin) propagator given as

and t3
=
t4,
i.e.,
K↑↓(r1, r2; r3, r4; t1 −t3). The Fourier transform is from
t1 −t3 to ω.
We symbolically solve Eq. (6) to be
R = K + KWK + KWKWK + · · · = K(1 −WK)−1,
where the numerator K describes the Stoner excitations,
whereas zeros of the denominator (1 −WK) gives the
collective excitation.

where k, k′ are in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, n(n′) is the
band index summed over occupied (unoccupied) states,
εkn↑(εkn↓) is the nth majority (minority) band energy
at k, and Ψ is the eigenfunction of H0.
As mentioned in Ref. [16], in order to satisfy the Gold-
stone theorem ω(q) →0 (q →0), we need to intro-
duce a factor η for R = K(1 −ηWK)−1. In principle,
the Goldstone theorem should be automatically satisﬁed
with the LR method since we expect that the LR method
evaluates the second derivative of the total energy of
the ground states. However, our LR is not formulated
to reproduce the second derivative exactly; furthermore,
QSGW is not formulated to minimize the total energy.
This simple scaling by introducing η is a quick remedy
to satisfy the theorem; their deviations from unity show
the size of vertex corrections, which should be added to
the interaction W. The calculated η of LDA (QSGW)
are 1.15 (1.19), 1.41 (1.87), 1.26 (1.33), and 1.05 (0.87)
for Fe, Ni, Co, and FeCo, respectively. These η are in
good agreement with previous calculations 1.28, 1.5, and
1.33 for Fe [28], Ni [16], and FeCo [28]. The deviations
are not small enough. We may need to treat the vertex
correction accurately in order to override the ambiguity
due to this quick remedy in the future.
C.
Wannier representation
Based on Refs.
[29, 30], we generate MLWFs from
eigenfunctions of LDA or QSGW. Once we generate ML-
WFs, we can obtain the Wannier representation of R↑↓
as follow.
In the Wannier basis, we expand eigenfunctions as
Ψkn(r) = P
Ri akn
Riwk
Ri(r),
(9)
where akn
Ri is the expansion coeﬃcient, R is atomic po-
sition in a primitive cell, i is the Wannier orbital (e.g.
i = 3dxy) of each atom on R. wk
Ri(r) is represented as a
complete set of orthogonal basis {wRi(r)},
wk
Ri(r) =

√
N
X
T
wRi(r −R −T) exp(ik · T), (10)
where T is the lattice translation vector and N is the
normalization constant satisfying the Born von Kar-
man boundary condition.
By using the orthogonality,
the eigenvalue equations HΨkn(r) = εknΨkn(r) can be
rewritten with this Wannier representation,

Substituting Eqs. (9) and (10) to Eq. (8) and using
Fourier transform of real-space, we will obtain the time-
ordered linear response function for a non-interacting sys-
tem represented in a restricted Hilbert space,

by a tetrahedron method and obtain its real part by the
Hilbert transform. The matrix element of R↑↓
Rij,R′kl is
calculated through R = K(1 −ηWK)−1, where W is
calculated in the random phase approximation (RPA) in
the product basis technique developed in Ref. [31].

Calculation details
All of the calculation procedures above are imple-
mented in the ﬁrst-principles package ecalj [20, 21]. The
ecalj is based on the linearized augmented plane-wave
and muﬃn-tin orbital (MTO) method (PMT method),
which combines augmented plane wave (APW) and MTO
basis sets. We also generate MLWFs in ecalj. We per-
form LDA and QSGW calculations for band structures
with 20 × 20 × 20 and 16 × 16 × 16 k-point mesh re-
spectively. We consider 9 MLWFs (spd) for the 3d el-
emental materials (Fe and Ni) and 18 MLWFs for hcp
Co and binary FeCo. In the calculations of K↑↓, we use
48 × 48 × 48 q-point mesh for the 3d elemental material
and 24×24×24 for binary FeCo. We use static and onsite
W, i.e., we take Wijkl(ω) = WRij,Rkl(ω = 0). We use
experimental lattice parameters, a = 2.867 ˚A, a = 3.524
˚A, a = 2.850 ˚A for Fe, Ni, and FeCo, respectively. For
hcp Co, we use a = 2.507 ˚A and c = 4.070 ˚A.4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
bcc Fe
Figs. 1(a), (b), and (c) show the majority and minor-
ity band structures and the partial density of states in
QSGW for Fe, while Figs. 1(d), (e), and (f) in LDA as
well. Calculated total magnetic moments in LDA and
QSGW are both 2.22 µB for Fe, in agreement with the
experimental value 2.22 µB [32], in contrast to 2.93 µB
in the fully self-consistent GW method [33]. Our results
are consistent with Ref. [17] by Sponza et al. The su-
perposed Wannier band structures in Eq. (11) by broken
lines are entirely on the original band structures by bold
grey lines. Size of colored circles show the weights of each
MLWF. In Table I, we show the t2g of minority spin at
Γ and that of majority spin at N in LDA and QSGW.
QSGW gives better agreement with the angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data [34]. The 3d-
bandwidth in QSGW is a little smaller than that in LDA.
Except for this diﬀerence, the overall shapes of the ma-
jority and the minority bands are similar in both LDA

at N for the majority spin. These are in LDA, in QSGW, in
addition to the experimental data by ARPES [34]. Energy is

Fig. 2(a) shows −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] in LDA and in

We
use a little diﬀerent deﬁnition from Refs. 16, 28, and 35,
thus it is not meaningful to compare absolute value of
K+−(q, ω) with their results.
As shown in the ﬁgure,
QSGW gives smaller ∆Ex and 3d-bandwidth, which is
consistent with results by Sponza et al. Roughly speak-
ing, the shape of −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] agree with the
shape of density of states (DOS) of majority spin. The
peak around 2 eV originates from the t↑
2g-t↓
2g and e↑
g-
e↓
g transition, i.e., vertical transitions to the unoccupied
minority states above the Fermi energy EFermi from the
occupied majority states just below the EFermi in Fig. 1.

(red bold line) and in LDA (blue broken line). The inset is
the total density of states in Fe. (b) and (c) show calculated
−Im[K+−(q, ω)] along the BZ symmetry line in LDA and
QSGW, respectively. Ωis the unit cell volume.5
The second peak around 4 eV is stemmed from another
e↑
g-e↓
g transition to EFermi + 2 eV in minority states from
EFermi −2 eV in majority states.
We see two features in the diﬀerence between LDA and
QSGW in −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] shown in Fig. 2(a). One
is that the width of the peak around 2 eV in QSGW is
wider than that in LDA. The diﬀerence of DOS in LDA
and QSGW can not explain this fact; it can be due to
the diﬀerence of eigenfunctions. The peak becomes wider
in QSGW, probably because of the general tendency of
QSGW that it makes a more signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween occupied 3d states and unoccupied 3d states. The
former is more localized, and the latter more extended
in comparison with the case in LDA. The other is the
width due to the 3d band; corresponding to the width of
3d band shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), we see narrower
width in −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] in QSGW.
Figs. 2(b) and (c) show the Stoner excitation spectrum
−Im[K+−(q, ω)] in LDA and QSGW. Our LDA results
give good agreement with Fig.
6 in Ref.
35.
We see
red triangle-like strong intensity around Γ, especially in
LDA. The center of peak moves up as a function of q.
This is because shifted q from Γ requires corresponding
energy shift to trace the peak of −Im[K+−(q, ω)] as a
function of ω. This is explained in Fig. 7 of Ref. 35.
Fig. 3 shows Im[R+−(q, ω)] in LDA (a) and in QSGW
(b), where R+−(q, ω) means the trace of the matrix R↑↓
given as R+−(q, ω) = P
R,i,j R↑↓
Rii,Rjj(q, ω). We super-
pose experimental data [1, 36] on it. We also superpose
the SW dispersion calculated with the LF [9] in LDA,
and that with FMM in LDA [10]. These are not only in
(a) but also in (b) as a guide of eye. As shown in Fig. 3,
the peak broadening due to the Stoner damping can be
seen even below 100 meV because bcc Fe is a weak ferro-
magnet, whose majority and minority 3d have relatively
large DOS at EFermi as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a).
This results in relatively large low-energy Stoner excita-
tions. It means that SWs are getting to be hybridized
well with Stoner excitation immediately after departing
from Γ. The strong damping around H is also seen in the
previous calculation combining the the generalized gra-
dient approximation (GGA) and the MLWF approach
with 6 MLWFS (sd) [28]. Our LDA calculation indicates
Kohn anomalies in Γ-H, H-N, and Γ-N, which are also
found in the other calculations [9–11]. We checked calcu-
lations with denser q-point mesh (60×60×60) and con-
ﬁrmed the strong anomaly at 2/3 along Γ-N in LDA, and
especially in QSGW. Ref. [35] explains how such anoma-
lies can be traced back to the band structures, although
they have not given explicit analysis. Real metals such
as Fe can have complicated band structures, resulting in
too complicated Fermi-surface-nestings like phenomena
to be analyzed. Thus, we also have not yet got into such
analysis. We are somehow skeptical whether it is worth
to do or not.
In Table II, we summarize calculated results of stiﬀ-
ness constant D, with another LR result based on the
GGA [28], and with that of the time-dependent density

cause of the mesh of used k points.
Results with LF [9]
(solid line), and that with FMM [10] (broken line) are super-
posed. Experimental data by neutron scattering are indicated
by open squares (Fe (12%Si) at RT [1]) and open circles (pure
Fe at 10 K [36].)
functional theory (TDDFT) [37]. To obtain D, we ﬁt the
calculated SW dispersion by quadratic functions. For the
ﬁtting, we just take peaks for small q as |q| < 0.20( 2π
a )
where little Stoner damping occurs. Details for Fe and
Ni are in supplements [38]. LDA gives D = 155 meV·˚A2,
which is a little smaller than experiments D = 230, 280
meV·˚A2 [1, 6]. On the other hand, QSGW gives D = 222
meV·˚A2 in much better agreement with the experimental
values. Note that we see a contradiction between our LR
(LDA) and the other two previous calculations, the LR
(GGA) and the LF. Our values D = 155 meV·˚A2 is too
low in comparison with the other data 248, 250 meV·˚A2,
although the smaller diﬀerence from D = 189 meV·˚A2 in
TDDFT. However, we currently have no deﬁnite idea to
resolve the discrepancy from these previous works.
B.
fcc Ni
The calculated magnetic moment for Ni in LDA is in
agreement with the experiment, 0.62 µB [32].
On the
other hand, QSGW gives 0.80 µB. Sponza et al. [17] in-
dicates that this is reasonable because we have not taken6

[28], with the LF [9], and with the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) [37] (on average). In addition we show inelastic neutron
scattering data [1, 2, 6, 40, 44, 46].

In LDA, we may have accidentally had a good agreement
because of too small exchange splitting cancels the fact
that calculations do not include the ﬂuctuation.
Fig. 4(a) shows the −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] in Ni. Peaks
at 0.7 eV and 0.8 eV in LDA and QSGW are the Stoner
gaps, corresponding to the diﬀerence of peaks between
majority and minority spins in DOS shown in its inset.
∆Ex given in LDA and QSGW are about two times larger
than 0.3 eV, which is the value obtained by ARPES
at L3 point [39]. Sponza et al. [17] indicates that the

overestimation is due to the missing of spin ﬂuctuations.
Figs. 4(b) and (c) show −Im[K+−(q, ω)] in LDA and
QSGW. Our LDA results give good agreement with Fig.
6 of Ref.
35.
We see that strong intensity around Γ
get broadened as a function of q as in the case of ho-
mogeneous electron gas shown in Fig. 5 of Ref. 35. In
QSGW, q-dependence of −Im[K+−(q, ω)] looks slightly

Experimental results by neutron scattering [41] are indicated
by circles.7
weakened around Γ, probably because of the reﬂection of
ﬂattened (weak q-dependent) 3d band.
In Fig. 5 (a), we show Im[R+−(q, ω)] in LDA. We can
identify the SW dispersion in the whole BZ in contrast
to the case of Fe in Fig. 3. Our SW dispersion in LDA
is consistent with a previous LR calculation by Savrasov
[14] and a TDDFT calculation by Niesert [37]. As super-
posed in Fig. 5, results with FMM [10] and with the LF
[9] give a little lower ω(q). Let us compare QSGW result
shown in Fig. 5(b) with (a), where we can use black lines
as a guide of eye. ω(q) curvature around Γ is smaller
in QSGW. In fact, Table II shows that QSGW gives
very smaller D = 449 meV·˚A2 around Γ than D = 873
meV·˚A2 in LDA. This is in agreement with the exper-
imental values D = 433, 555 meV·˚A2 [2, 40].
This is
the reﬂection of weak q-dependence of −Im[K+−(q, ω)]
around Γ in the previous paragraph. Along Γ-L, QSGW
successfully trace an experiment [41] even up to the half
of the BZ boundary. Although (b) may be taken as a
simple elongation of (a) at a glance, it is not true if we
take the behavior around Γ into account. In Ref. [15],
Karlsson and Aryasetiawan gives good agreement with
the SW dispersion along [100] by adjusting the ∆Ex of
Ni. However, such a procedure may give a simple shrink-
age. Thus the physical mechanism in QSGW is very dif-
ferent from their method even though both our QSGW
and their method reproduce the experimental D.

hcp Co
Fig. 6(a) shows the −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] in Co and
Figs. 6(b) and (c) show −Im[K+−(q, ω)] in LDA and
QSGW. The calculated magnetic moments per Co atom
is 1.67 µB in LDA, 1.76 µB in QSGW. These are a little
larger than the experiment 1.58 µB [42]. It is reasonable
in the sense that the QSGW value relative to experiment
is 1.76 µB/1.58 µB, in between 2.22 µB /2.22 µB (Fe)
and 0.80 µB /0.62 µB (Ni).
Let us compare peaks of
3d shown in insets with those for Fe and Ni (Figs.
2
and 4). In QSGW, 3d bands are narrower than LDA in
both of majority, and minority spins in Co and Ni, in
contrast to the case of Fe where little narrowing of DOS
in the minority spins.
It is probably because the bcc
structure has more hybridization with sp bands than fcc
and hcp. In Co, the largest peaks of 3d are pushed down
by QSGW relative to LDA, with keeping the exchange
splitting.
Thus changes of −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] from
QSGW to LDA are similar in Fe and Co. As we already
noted in Sec.III A, we admit several universal tendencies
of QSGW relative to LDA, however, such changes of DOS
and −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] are hardly predicted without
calculations in practice.
In Fig. 7(a), we show Im[R+−(q, ω)] in LDA together
with plots of the SW dispersion given by the FMM [10]
FIG. 7.
Im[R+−(q, ω)] for Co in LDA (a) and in QSGW (b),
showing the SW dispersion. The LF [9] (bold line), the FMM
calculation [10] (broken line) are also shown. Experimental
data by neutron scattering [43] are indicated by circles. The
inset shows the BZ for hcp Co and its symmetry lines.8
(black broken lines) and by the LF [9] (black lines).
In these plots, two branches appear because of two
atoms per primitive cell.
The LF traces peaks of our
Im[R+−(q, ω)] very well especially along Γ-A-K-H-A.
At M around, the black lines are slightly lower than
the peak of Im[R+−(q, ω)] seen at ∼800 meV. Near Γ,
Im[R+−(q, ω)] shows no optical branch.
Experimental
data shown by oval circles [43, 44] are a little lover than
the plots and peaks of Im[R+−(q, ω)].
In contrast, we have an impressive agreement with
the experiment in QSGW. As seen in Fig. 7(b), oval
circles are on the peak of Im[R+−(q, ω)] in QSGW.
The calculated D shown in Table II in QSGW are 486
meV·˚A2 along [100], and 532 meV·˚A2 along [001]. These
give much better agreements with experiments, consis-
tent with the agreement in Fig. 7(b).
This agreement
of the SW energy is probably originated from narrower
3d band in QSGW, resulting weaker q-dependence of
−Im[K+−(q, ω)], rather than LDA.
D.
B2 FeCo
We treat B2 FeCo in the CsCl structure. Calculated
magnetic moments per cell are 4.44 µB in LDA, 4.80 µB in
QSGW. The latter is close to experiment 4.70 µB [45]. It
is consistent with other compounds [18, 19] where QSGW
give agreements with experiments as for magnetic mo-

ments when LDA gives underestimation. Alternatively,
we may take FeCo as a case between Fe and Co. Since
QSGW/experiment = 2.22 µB/2.22 µB for Fe, = 1.76
µB/1.58 µB for Co, we may say that slight overestima-
tion 4.80 µB/4.70 µB is reasonable.
Fig. 8(a) shows −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)] in LDA and
QSGW. In its inset, ∆Ex is ∼2.8 eV in QSGW while
∼2.2 eV in LDA. The diﬀerence results in the diﬀerence
of peaks in −Im[K+−(q = 0, ω)]. Figs. 8(b) and (c) show
−Im[K+−(q, ω)] in LDA and QSGW, although we see no
speciﬁc features worth to be mentioned.
Fig. 9 shows Im[R+−(q, ω)] in (a) LDA and in (b)
QSGW, together with the previous SW calculation in
the FMM [11]. Im[R+−(q, ω)] in LDA shows the lower
peaks of ω(q) than FMM. Im[R+−(q, ω)] in LDA gives
D = 407 meV·˚A2 is a little smaller than 500 meV·˚A2 by
Grotheer [11]. The optical branch is weakened as in the
case of Fe. Weak peak around ∼600 meV are close to
ω(q) in FMM.
In QSGW, there is lower ω(q) in the whole BZ as in
the case of Co. Table II shows that D = 307 meV·˚A2
in QSGW is much smaller than the experiment 450-500
meV·˚A2 by inelastic neutron scattering [46]. Considering
success on Fe, Ni, and Co, this FeCo was the case that
we could expect a good agreement with experiments. We
have not yet found a reason why QSGW gives such dis-
crepancy from the experiment.

SUMMARY
In order to calculate SW dispersion in QSGW, we have
implemented an eﬀective numerical method for calculat-
ing R+−(q, ω) in a package ecalj. This is in the linear
response formulation based on the maximally localized
Wannier functions as given in Ref. 16.
Then we apply the method to Fe, Ni, Co, and FeCo.
We compare peak of Im[R+−(q, ω)] with inelastic neu-
tron scattering data and with the spin stiﬀness D. For
Fe, Ni, and Co, QSGW gives much better agreements
with the experiment rather than LDA does.
Notably,
too large D of Ni in LDA is reduced by half, resulting in
a good agreement with the experiment. We see similar
agreement for Co in comparison with the neutron scat-
tering data. For FeCo, we have not yet understood why
D in QSGW disagree with the experiment.
Such good agreements are owing to the reliable descrip-
tion of the electronic structure in QSGW. QSGW gives
a good description of 3d-bandwidth, ∆Ex and magnetic
moments, except the case of Ni where we have a too
large magnetic moment. Our method developed here is
promising in the sense that it covers wide range of mate-
rials from metals treated here to transition-metal oxides
where LDA can be hardly applicable.
