Despite the lack of reproducible experimental conﬁrmation, group-V elements have been consid-
ered as possible sources of p-type doping in ZnO in the form of simple and complex defects. Using
ab initio calculations, based on state-of-the-art hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we study a
wide range of defects and defect complexes related with N, P, As, and Sb impurities. We show that
none of the candidates for p-type doping can be considered a good source of holes in the valence
band due to deep acceptor levels and low formation energies of compensating donor defects. In
addition, we discuss the stability of complexes in diﬀerent regimes.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Zinc oxide has attracted considerable interest as a
promising material for optoelectronics applications, such
as light-emitting diodes and solar cells, due to its large
band gap and large exciton binding energy. The actual
possibility of successfully employing ZnO in these kinds
of devices relies on the ability of preparing a stable p-
type as well as an n-type ZnO. Unfortunately, like other
wide band gap semiconductors, ZnO suﬀers from a dop-
ing asymmetry problem and, while n-type ZnO has been
easily obtained, reliable p-type ZnO has not been pro-
duced yet1.
One of the most common ways to overcome this diﬃ-
culty has been to incorporate group-V elements, in the
hope that they could substitute oxygen in ZnO crystal
and should in principle provide shallow enough acceptor
levels. In particular, nitrogen has played the role of the
favorite dopant, owing to its atomic size close to that of
oxygen. Experimentally, despite the great deal of eﬀort
devoted to the topic, only few successes in achieving p-
type ZnO have been reported with this kind of doping2–5
and up to now none of them has eventually led to further
development.
From a theoretical point of view, the understanding of
these results and the proposition of other ways of obtain-
ing p-type doping by means of density functional theory
(DFT) calculations is a challenging task as well. In fact,
the problem of the band gap underestimation related to
the local or semilocal approximations of the exchange
correlation functional is particularly relevant in the case
of ZnO, with a calculated gap of only ∼0.8 eV. Calcula-
tions performed within these approximations have shown,
for example, a transition level of 0.4 eV for NO6 and
shallow levels for complexes of the form XZn-2VZn7, but,
in light of the severe gap underestimation, these results
should be considered with care. Recently, some of these
calculations have been updated with the introduction of
hybrid functionals, which use an admixture of exact and
local exchange, giving larger values of the band gap and
providing more reliable results. According to the latest
evaluation with hybrid functionals for some group-V re-
lated defects8–12, the results indicate that the acceptor
levels are much deeper than expected from previous cal-
culations, suggesting that these are not good candidates
for achieving p-type doping. Anyway, these calculations
have been carried out with diﬀerent approximations and
several of the possible defects have not been considered,
making it diﬃcult to draw a uniform conclusion about
the doping with group-V elements. To ﬁll this gap, in
this paper we consider the problem of ZnO doping with
N, P, As, and Sb in the most relevant defect conﬁgu-
rations by means of DFT calculations based on hybrid
functionals. We show that it is unlikely to obtain good
acceptor states from these elements and ﬁnally, we dis-
cuss the possibility of actually observing complex defects
in doped samples.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows:
in Sec. II we introduce the methods used in our calcu-
lations and we discuss our approximations. In Sec. III
we begin our analysis of defects identiﬁed as promising
for p-type doping in the literature, starting from simple
substitutional defects XO and XZn (X=N, P, As, Sb). In
Sec. IV we study complex defects. First, given the sta-
bility of the N2 molecule and their importance for p-type
doping13,14, we analyze the (N2)O and (N2)Zn defects.
Then, we consider complexes of the form XZn-2VZn and
XZn-VZn, which are proved to be binding in ZnO7,15. In
this section, to evaluate the binding energies of the com-
plexes, the isolated Zn vacancy VZn is studied as well.
Finally, in Sec. V we discuss the possibilities of actu-
ally observing these kinds of complexes, based on their
binding energy.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Our calculations are performed in the framework
of plane-wave pseudopotential DFT as implemented in
the Quantum ESPRESSO package16. Norm-conserving
pseudopotentials are employed for all the atoms, with the
semicore Zn 3d states included in the valence electrons,
and the energy cutoﬀset to 80 Ry. The exchange cor-
relation potential is treated with the hybrid functional
of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE)17, based on the
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) function where a
fraction α of the exchange is replaced by Hartree-Fock
(HF) exchange. However, the problem of choosing the
α parameter to get accurate defect levels is still un-
der debate and its value has been set based on several2
schemes8,10,18.
Because we are dealing with transition
energies that span all the band gap, we set α = 0.45.
This allows us to correctly reproduce the experimental
value of the band gap of 3.44 eV and gives lattice pa-
rameters a = 3.23 ˚A, c = 5.19 ˚A and u = 0.38, in good
agreement with the experiments. Such a large value of
α may aﬀect the transition levels due to the downshift
of the valence band maximum (VBM) when the α pa-
rameter is increased, but this fact should not alter the
general conclusions drawn in the following. The calcu-
lations are carried out in a 72 atom supercell with a
2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack grid19 to sample the Brillouin
zone, while the Fock exchange potential is calculated us-
ing a coarser 1 × 1 × 1 grid of Q-points20. The formation
energies of defect D in charge state q are calculated ac-
cording to the formula21
Ef(D, q) = Etot(D, q) −Etot(bulk)
−

niµi + q(ǫv + ǫF + ∆V ) + ∆Eel(q),

where Etot(D, q) and Etot(bulk) represent the total en-
ergy of the supercell with and without the defect, ǫv is
the energy of the VBM, ǫF indicates the value of the
Fermi level inside the band gap, and ∆V is a potential
alignment term22. The electrostatic correction ∆Eel(q) is
calculated as the monopole Madelung term23 in the gen-
eralized case when anisotropy in the screening requires
that the dielectric constant ε is replaced by a tensor ¯ε24:

In the case of ZnO ¯ε = diag(ε⊥, ε⊥, ε∥) with ε⊥= 7.77
and ε∥= 8.9125.
Finally, for each specie i, ni is the
change in the total number of atoms to create defect D
and µi is the corresponding chemical potential, which
are constrained by the growth conditions. In particular,
µZn = µ0
Zn + ∆Hf and µO = µO2/2 for an O-rich en-
vironment, while µZn = µ0
Zn and µO = µO2/2 + ∆Hf
for Zn-rich conditions.
Here ∆Hf = −2.96 eV is the
calculated ZnO enthalpy of formation. If needed, also
the chemical potentials of the group-V dopants should
be constrained as well. The results shown are under the
dopant rich condition, using molecular N2 and P4O10,
and solid As2O3 and Sb2O3 as dopant sources.
Note
that the diﬀerent compositions of these sources, which
include oxygen in diﬀerent percentages, make a numer-
ical comparison of the formation energies of the defects
not straightforward.
In order to assess the correctness of our approxima-
tions, we performed a test for the notable case of NO. To

this aim we used the HSE hybrid functional and projec-
tor augmented wave (PAW)26 potentials as implemented
in the VASP code27, using a cutoﬀof 400 eV and setting
α = 0.375 to correctly reproduce the experimental band
gap8. We considered 72 atom and 192 atom supercells,
with, respectively, a 2 × 2 × 2 and Γ k-points sampling
for the Brillouin zone. A Madelung correction calculated
from Eq. (2) has been applied to the charged system. As
can be seen from the results in Fig. 1, a good convergence
is achieved for the neutral and charged state, conﬁrming
that a 72 atom supercell is enough to correctly describe
these deep defects. In addition, this comparison assesses
the reliability of the norm-conserving pseudopotentials
compared to the more accurate PAW scheme. Note the
impressive agreement for the transition level ǫ(0/−) and
the fair agreement for the formation energy Ef.
Since the NO defect has been already widely studied,
even with hybrid functionals, it is worth comparing our
results with those present in the literature in the case of
α being tuned to match the experimental band gap.The
data are summarized in Table I. Our value for the ǫ(0/−)
transition energy of 2.1 eV is the same as obtained by
Lany and Zunger10 for α = 0.38. The value of 1.8 eV for
α = 0.375 calculated by Boonchun and Lambrecht28 is
very close to our value without the Madelung correction.
This is also in agreement with our results obtained with
VASP (see Fig. 1). At variance, Lyons et al.9 and Sakong
et al.29 ﬁnd a transition energy of 1.3 and 1.46, respec-
tively, setting α = 0.36. This is in agreement with the
result of Gallino et al.11, which, however, is obtained with
the B3LYP hybrid functional30, making the comparison
less straightforward.
The reason for the disagreement
between the two groups of results is still unclear.

Figure 2. Formation energy Ef of simple substitutional de-
fects as a function of the Fermi level in Zn-rich conditions.
The Zn-rich conditions are chosen so to best stabilize the oxy-
gen substitution. The zero of the Fermi level has been set to
the valence band maximum.
3. The former ﬁgure deals with the simple substitutional
defects under Zn-rich growth conditions and the latter
ﬁgure focuses on complexes under O-rich conditions. As
it is immediately evident, in most cases, defects of the
same kind display the same qualitative behavior for all
the dopants, and for P, As, and Sb a quantitative agree-
ment can be recognized. We thus begin analyzing each
specie of defect. Simple oxygen substitutional defects XO
are single acceptors due to the missing electron in group-
V elements compared to O. From a structural point of
view, when using hybrid functionals the hole present in
the neutral charge state is localized on one of the four
bonds, producing a nonsymmetric conﬁguration.
It has been shown that NO with the hole localized along
the bond parallel to the c axis (NO∥) is the most sta-
ble conﬁguration and gives good agreement with electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements10,11. Our
calculations conﬁrm these results, with NO∥conﬁgura-
tion having a 45 meV lower energy than the one with the
hole localized along a bond perpendicular to the c axis
(NO⊥), highlighting the ability of hybrid functionals to
correctly describe these kinds of defects. For PO, AsO,
and SbO we found the same tendency to hole localiza-
tion, with the diﬀerence that XO∥is unstable and only
conﬁgurations of the type XO⊥are observed and with a
much smaller asymmetry in the bond lengths. Although
defects of this kind have a stable negative charge state
conﬁguration, they fail to be good sources of holes. In
fact, with the notable exception of NO, all have quite high
formation energy compared to other species, even in the
Zn-rich limit, especially if the Fermi level is close to the
VBM. Even if this kind of defect could be stabilized, the
thermal transition energies ǫ(0/−) are 2.10, 2.58, 2.92,
and 3.37 eV for N, P, As, and Sb, respectively, making
them extremely deep acceptors. This should be enough
to disregard the XO conﬁgurations as a possible source
of p-type doping.
When substituting Zn atoms, group-V elements are in-
stead triple donors. According to our hybrid functional
results, P and Sb bear positive charge state for all the
values of ǫF making them good donors and in agree-
ment with some experimental results31, while N and As
has rather deep transition energies ǫ(0/+) = 1.1 eV and
ǫ(0/3+) = 0.73 eV from the top of the conduction band,
respectively.
However, in this context it is important
that, when ǫF is close to the valence band maximum,
X3+
Zn have a very small formation energy and therefore
will certainly contribute to compensate the eﬀect of ac-
ceptor impurities that one wants to create.
Also in this case, due to its smaller atomic radius, NZn
has a diﬀerent structure compared to P, As, and Sb. The
zinc site with four bonds is not stable and the N atom
tends to shift, bonding with a lower number of oxygen
atoms. We observed several inequivalent metastable con-
ﬁgurations, whose relative stability could depend also on
the charge state of the system. These conﬁgurations of-
ten include the formation of NOn (n=1,2,3) molecules
which are isolated or loosely bound to the crystal lattice.
In Fig. 2 we show only the formation energy for the most
stable conﬁgurations found. For the neutral charge state
N is bound to only 2 O atoms, which breaks part of the
bonds with their Zn nearest neighbors. In the 1+ charge
state we have a similar conﬁguration, with one of the
O breaking all the bonds, resulting in a NO2 molecule
bonded to the lattice through an O. Finally, for 2+ and
3+ charge states the defect results in a NO3 molecule
bounded to one of the neighboring Zn atoms. The ﬁnal
structure of the NZn defect leads to strong distortions in
the lattice and this will explain the much larger forma-
tion energy of NZn with respect to NO, when compared
with the behavior of the other group-V elements. In fact,
except for As0
Zn, where As is strongly bound to just three
O atoms, P, As, and Sb form a symmetric conﬁguration
after relaxation.

complex defects, starting from the N2 molecule, which
can substitute an O or a Zn atom as recently identiﬁed in
Ref. 14. In the former case each N atom binds with two
surrounding Zn and the molecule acts as a strong double
donor. It is also quite stable, compared with NO and even
NZn, and this provides a further reason for the diﬃculty
of obtaining p-type doping from N13. On the other hand,
(N2)Zn could be a double acceptor. Recently, Lambrecht
and Boonchun14 have studied the (N2)Zn molecule in an
isolated conﬁguration, excitingly concluding that it has a
relatively shallow transition energy ǫ(0/−) for both PBE
and HSE calculations. According to our results, however,
the system has two competing conﬁgurations, one with
the N2 forming a bridge across two O atoms and one in
the N2 isolated molecule conﬁguration with a S=1 spin
conﬁguration, as shown in Fig. 4. We found that the
most stable conﬁguration among the two is charge state
dependent. In particular, for the neutral defect the bridg-
ing conﬁguration is more stable by 0.25 eV. The opposite
is true for the 1−and 2−charge states, where the isolated
conﬁguration is much more favorable. Anyway, in both
cases the conﬁguration with higher energy is metastable.
The same trends are observed within PBE calculations,
even if the formation energy diﬀerences are smaller in this
case. With our calculation parameters, both the conﬁg-
urations in the neutral charge state have relatively low
formation energies, making the transition level very deep
(ǫ(0/−) = 1.92 eV), at variance with what has been ob-
served in Ref. 14. In addition, (N2)Zn is also less stable
than (N2)O, even in O-rich conditions, and thus unlikely
to be a good acceptor.
It should be noted that the neutral isolated conﬁgu-
ration is in a spin polarized state with spin S=1, as it
happens for the VZn defect. This, along with the similar
behavior for the transition energies of (N2)Zn and VZn,
could suggest that the N2 molecule remains quite inert
with respect to the environment and that the (N2)Zn de-
fect acts basically as a Zn vacancy.
Given the diﬃculties of ﬁnding a shallow acceptor
among simple donors conﬁgurations, complexes of the

(XZn −2VZn)−. Since the ﬁrst time they were proposed7,
due to the results of semilocal functional calculations32
these complexes are believed to be shallow acceptors and
have often been used to justify the observation of p-
type doping in experiments. Only recently Puchala and
Morgan12 have shown that AsZn-2VZn is instead a deep
acceptor according to hybrid DFT calculations.
Several inequivalent conﬁgurations can be found re-
moving three Zn atoms and adding one impurity.
We
thus consider four of them, shown in Fig. 5, with the
following diﬀerent qualitative peculiarities: (1) the two
vacancies placed at opposite sites with respect to the
dopant7 [Fig. 5(a)], (2) two neighboring vacancies next to
the dopant32 [Fig. 5(b)], and two neighboring vacancies
with the dopant shifted in (3) tetrahedral [Fig. 5(c)] and
(4) octahedral [Fig. 5(d)] interstitial positions12. For N
the most stable structure is obtained starting from con-
ﬁguration (3), but it ends up in a distorted conﬁguration,
with N bound to only three O atoms. When the dopant is
P or As conﬁgurations (2) and (3) are the most favorable
and almost equivalent in energy, with (2) being slightly
favored. Sb, having a larger size, prefers conﬁguration
(4).
Here only the values of these most stable conﬁgurations
are reported. It can be argued that the small sizes of the
supercell could play a role in determining the most favor-
able conﬁguration, since the complex is quite extended
and this could actually be the case, as demonstrated in
some cases15. However, the diﬀerences in the formation
energies between the various conﬁgurations are usually
below few hundreds of meV, a quantity that will only
marginally aﬀect the values of formation and binding en-
ergies and will not alter the relevant conclusions of our
work, like the transition energies being too deep and the
formation energies of XZn-2VZn defects being much larger
than those of XZn-VZn close to the VBM.
These defects require several missing Zn, therefore the
O-rich conditions should make them more stable. It can
be seen in Fig.
3 that, in this limit, XZn-2VZn is the5

acceptor with the lowest formation energy, even if still
larger than that of XZn for a wide range inside the band
gap. Despite their relatively low formation energies, we
are faced again with the problem of deep values of the
ionization energies ǫ(0/−) for all the group-V elements:
1.53, 1.48, 1.50, and 1.69 eV for N, P, As, and Sb, re-
spectively. Unlike for XO defects, the transition energies
are approximately the same for all X and much smaller,
but still too deep to provide good acceptor levels.
Because XZn-2VZn are complex defects that involve
three atoms, it is necessary to study the properties of
its simpler components, namely XZn-VZn and VZn. Com-
plexes with only one vacancy XZn-VZn are quite stable as
well, but they do not undergo strong deformation. They
are just hold together by the attractive Coulomb inter-
action between X3+
Zn and V 2−
Zn and, as expected, they are
donors.
Once again the presence of the NZn leads to quite
large formation energies for NZn-2VZn and NZn-VZn. This
should be considered as a direct consequence of the large
formation energy of NZn and of the lattice distortions
that come with it.
Finally, it can be seen that zinc vacancy is a double
acceptor, but with a deep transition level ǫ(0/−) = 1.68
eV and a high formation energy close to the VBM. As
mentioned before, the neutral charge state is more stable
in a spin polarized conﬁguration, as in the case of the
isolated molecule conﬁguration of (N2)Zn.

STABILITY OF VACANCY RELATED
COMPLEXES
Up to now, we have shown that these complexes should
not be suitable to create p-type ZnO. Nonetheless, there
are some speculations about their possible presence in
experiments33,34 and so it is interesting to check whether
these kinds of defects are likely to be found or not. For
the cluster to form, it is essential that their binding en-
ergy Eb = Ef(X) + nEf(VZn) −Ef(X-nVZn) is positive
and large enough to favor the complexes over the single
components. The values of Eb for all the kinds of dopants
are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of the Fermi level. The
complexes including N are much less binding than those
for the other group-V elements, and, in particular, NZn-
VZn is almost never binding. As a further conﬁrmation
of the scarce utility of the complexes we can see that they
are just loosely binding in the p-type regime, while the
binding energy grows rapidly with ǫF and could remain
as large as 5 eV up to the conduction band minimum for
PZn-2VZn. This suggests that it should be possible to
observe them for large enough values of ǫF .
To further investigate this possibility, we consider the
case when the defects are formed out of equilibrium in
the crystal during the growth and the total amounts of
dopants and vacancies remain ﬁxed during the cooling
down of the sample.
In this process the defects could
reorganize in complexes and the evolution of the concen-
trations as function of the temperature T is governed by
the mass-action law
[X-nVZn] = [X][VZn]n exp(Eb/kBT ),
n = 1, 2
(3)
where [X-nVZn], [X], and [VZn] are the defect con-
centrations and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
The
experimentally reported densities of group-V elements
are quite variable in the range 1015–1020 cm−3, while
Zn vacancies35 could be found with a density of 1015–
1016 cm−3.

Solving the system given by Eqs. (3) and (4) for Eb(ǫF )
and T down to room temperature, we veriﬁed that the
concentrations tend to saturate quite fast with one of the
defect among XZn-2VZn, XZn-VZn, and VZn dominating
the others. Of course, in our conﬁguration the limiting
factor for complex total concentration is [VZn]tot, while
the group-V elements are supposed to be present in abun-
dance. We have veriﬁed that changes of a few orders of
magnitude in the values [X]tot and [VZn]tot only lead to
small changes in the relative concentrations and thus do
not alter qualitatively our ﬁndings.
The phase diagrams reporting the defect with the high-
est concentration are shown in Fig.
7 and they con-
ﬁrm that in the p-type regime the Zn vacancy should
be the dominant defect, ruling out the XZn-2VZn as dop-
ing sources. For larger values of ǫF , instead, it appears
that both XZn-2VZn and XZn-VZn could be obtained, in
agreement with some experimental result. As a ﬁnal re-
mark, it should be pointed out that the dependence of the
defects diﬀusivity on ǫF and T 15,36 could hinder the reor-
ganization of the defects into complexes when decreasing
too quickly the temperature.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we studied the properties of ZnO doped
with group-V elements as possible candidates to provide
p-type doping. We show that none of the defect conﬁg-
urations considered so far are likely to provide a good
source of holes, due to the defects being too deep or even
worse to their tendency to behave like donors. We con-
sider the complexes XZn-2VZn and XZn-VZn and we pro-
vide a justiﬁcation to the experimental observation of
these kinds of defects.
