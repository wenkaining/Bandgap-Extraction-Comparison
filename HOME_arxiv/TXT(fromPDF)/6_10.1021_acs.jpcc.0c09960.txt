Abstract
A major challenge in the modeling of ionically
conducting glasses is to understand how the
large variety of possible chemical compositions
and speciﬁc features of their structure inﬂu-
ence ionic transport quantities. Here we revisit
and extend a theoretical approach for alkali
borophosphate glasses, where changes of con-
ductivity activation energies with the borate to
phosphate mixing ratio are related to modiﬁ-
cations of the ionic site energy landscape. The
landscape modiﬁcations are caused by varying
amounts of diﬀerent units forming the glassy
network, which lead to spatial redistributions
of the counter-charges of the mobile alkali ions.
Theoretical approaches are presented to cal-
culate variations of both network former unit
concentrations and activation energies with the
glass composition. Applications to several al-
kali borophosphate glasses show good agree-
ment with experimental data.

Introduction
High ionic conductivities are desired when op-
timizing glassy electrolytes for most applica-
tions.1 To guide this optimization process, it
is important to improve our theoretical un-
derstanding of ion motion in glasses.2 Strong
enhancements of ionic conductivities can be
achieved by utilizing various eﬀects, which we
term the “ionic concentration eﬀect”, “halide
doping eﬀect”, and “mixed glass former eﬀect”.
For the ionic concentration eﬀect, a strong (su-
perlinear) increase of ionic conductivity results
from an increase of the molar content of mobile
ions,3 and for the halide doping eﬀect from an
addition of alkali halides.4 In the case of the
“mixed glass former eﬀect”,5,6 a mixing of dif-
ferent types of glass formers, such as silicates,
borates, phosphates etc., can lead to a conduc-
tivity increase at intermediate mixing ratios.
Diﬀerent theoretical approaches were developed
to understand underlying physical mechanisms
causing the ionic concentration,7–10 the halide
doping11 and the mixed glass former eﬀect
(MGFE).12–14
The MGFE received particular attention in
the last decade.13,15 Upon mixing of two or
more glass formers, the ionic conductivity can
increase (positive MGFE)16 or decrease (neg-
ative MGFE).17,18 Many studies in particu-
lar were conducted for alkali borophosphate
glasses.14,19–22
In a former study, our research group de-
veloped a theoretical approach to explain the
MGFE in sodium borophosphate glasses with
compositions
0.4Na2O-0.6[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5]
in the whole range of borate to phosphate mix-
ing 0 ≤x ≤1.14 In this approach, a thermody-
namical model was ﬁrst introduced to describe
how relative amounts of diﬀerent types of net-
work forming units (NFUs) change with x.
Excellent agreement with experimental results

on the NFU concentrations, energy landscapes
for the sodium ion migration were constructed,
and the ionic transport studied by extensive ki-
netic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. These
simulations allowed the extraction of activa-
tion energies from Arrhenius plots of long-time
sodium diﬀusion coeﬃcients. The variation of
the activation energies with x showed good
agreement with experimental results for con-
ductivity activation energies obtained from
impedance spectroscopy.
Only one disorder
parameter was ﬁtted in the theory, when as-
suming a given concentration of vacant ionic
sites in the glass network. This parameter spec-
iﬁes additional ﬂuctuations in the energetics of
individual ion jumps.
Here we revisit the theoretical approach and
give explicit expressions for the NFU concentra-
tions, including additional results in the case of
low alkali concentrations. Thereafter we show
that it is possible to calculate conductivity ac-
tivation energies analytically from the land-
scape construction, which compare well with
the KMC results and experimental data.
We ﬁrst discuss that evaluating diﬀerences be-
tween percolation and Fermi energies, as sug-
gested earlier,10,23,24 yields approximate results
only.
An accurate theory is provided by an
eﬀective mapping to a disordered conductance
network,25,26 or equivalently, to a single-particle
hopping model in a landscape with spatially
varying jump barriers.
This means that a
purely analytical approach, with just a numer-
ical determination of Fermi energies and criti-
cal percolation barriers, is able to connect in-
formation on the structure (NFU concentra-
tions) with transport properties (activation en-
ergies) in very good agreement with experi-
ments. We ﬁnd it surprising that this is pos-
sible in a complex disordered system such as
the sodium borophosphate glasses.
The analytical treatment allows avoiding ex-
tensive computer simulations and for check-
ing the robustness of the theoretical approach
against variations of parameters within rea-
sonably limits, in particular the concentra-
tion of vacant ionic sites.
Moreover, one
can quickly apply the approach now to other
borophosphate glasses.
We demonstrate this
for lithium borophosphate glasses with compo-
sitions 0.33Li2O-0.67[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5], where
experimental results for NFU concentrations
and activation energies were reported in Ref.
27.

with compositions yM2O-(1 −y)[xB2O3-(1 −
x)P2O5] (M: alkali ion, y: molar fraction of al-
kali oxide) have shown the occurrence of eight
diﬀerent NFU types, see Fig. 1: neutral trig-
onal B(3) units with three bridging oxygens
(bOs), trigonal B(2) units with two bOs and one
negatively charged nonbridging oxygen (nbO),
negatively charged tetrahedral B(4) units with
four bOs, and tetrahedral phosphate units P(n),
n = 0, . . . 4,, with n bOs, (4 −n) nbOs, and
charges (n −3) (in units of the elementary
charge).
The concentration of these diﬀerent
NFU types depends on the overall glass com-
position.
We denote by {X} (X = B(n), n = 2, 3, 4, or
P(n), n = 0, . . . , 4) the fraction of NFUs with

The numbers indicate the charges of the species
(in units of the elementary charge) and the red
circles illustrate how the total charge can be
viewed as (partially) distributed among non-
bridging oxygens or among all oxygens in the
absence of nonbridging ones.

Equations (2a)-(2c) are three determining equa-
tions for the eight unknown NFU fractions.
To obtain a complete set of determining
equations, a thermodynamic model was devel-
oped,14 which is based on diﬀerent formation
enthalpies GX of the NFUs X. The diﬀerences
between these formation enthalpies can be re-
lated to the charge delocalization in the NFUs,
with lower formation enthalpies for higher de-
localization.
If diﬀerences ∆GX are signiﬁcantly larger
than the thermal energy kBTg at the glass tran-
sition (Tg: glass transition temperature), a hi-
erarchy results with respect to the preference
of the negatively charged NFUs to compensate
for the alkali ion charges.

P(4) units, which were not considered in Ref.
14, the hierarchy corresponds to an ordering
GB(4) < GP(2) < GP(1) < GP(0) < GB(2) of
the charged NFU types. The hierarchy implies
that NFU types with higher formation enthalpy
do not occur unless they must form to satisfy
all constraints. In addition to the constraints
given by the equations (2a)-(2c), an important
further one is that of forbidden linkages be-
tween B(4) units.30 This can be attributed to
the homogeneously delocalized charge of the
B(4) units, which impedes the formation of an
oxygen bridge between them. For small ∆GX,
which are less than about 4kBTg, it is possible to
reﬁne the treatment by introducing dispropor-
tionation reactions between the respective NFU
types.
In Table 1 we give the fractions {X} of the
various NFU types predicted by the theory14
without consideration of disproportionation re-
actions, and for alkali ion fractions {M} larger
than a critical value {M}⋆= 3/7 ∼= 0.43.
In this regime of high alkali content, we pre-
dict no P(4) units to occur (see below). Using
the equations in Table 1, we ﬁnd good agree-
ment with MAS-NMR results for various series
of alkali borophosphate glasses with composi-
tions 0.4Na2O-0.6[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5], yNa2O-
2(1-y)[BPO4],
and
0.33Li2O-0.67[xB2O3–(1-
x)P2O5], see Fig. 2.
If {M} is smaller than {M}⋆= 3/7 (or
y = {M}/(1 + {M}) < 0.3), one needs to con-
sider the P(4) units also. This NFU type has
not been considered in Ref. 14, but experimen-
tal observations give strong evidence of its oc-
currence.28,31 At low alkali content, it becomes
energetically favorable to form more negatively
charged B(4) units than are needed for compen-
sating all charges of alkali ions. The additional
negative charges of B(4) units are compensated
by the positive charges of P(4) units.
The P(4) units should have small formation
enthalpies also due to their high charge delocal-
ization and their large number of four bOs. One
can imagine mutually linked B(4) and P(4) units
to form small crystalline-type cluster conﬁgu-
rations, as sketched in Fig. 12 of Ref. 28. The
theoretical modeling in Ref. 14 is thus extended
by the following additional requirement:
The
number of B(4) units is maximal under consid-
eration of positively charged P(4) units and the
constraints given by the stoichiometry, charge
neutrality and forbidden B(4)-B(4) linkages. For
the same reasons as for the B(4) units, we expect
also that P(4) units do not link to themselves.
On can check that this further constraint can

tal MAS-NMR data (ﬁlled squares) for various

and from Ref. 29 for x = 1; (b) Glasses with
compositions yNa2O-2(1-y)[BPO4] with exper-
imental data from Ref. 28.
For x = 0.25,
the theoretical values with consideration of P(4)

always be fulﬁlled with the NFU fractions cal-
culated below.
The requirement of forbidden B(4)-B(4) link-
ages implies
4{B(4)} ≤3{B(3)} + 2{B(2)} + 4{P(4)}
+ 3{P(3)} + 2{P(2)} + {P(1)} (4)
Using this relation, the hierarchy of formation
enthalpies and the principle of maximal possible
number of B(4) units, we predict four diﬀerent
regimes 1 to 4 to occur for {M} ≤{M}⋆, where
certain NFU types are replaced by certain other
types. Reﬁnements are possible by considering
disproportionation reactions but we are not in-
cluding them in the following analysis. The four
regimes are as follows:
Regime 1 (0 ≤x ≤x1): Replacement of P(2)
by B(4) units. In the phosphate glass (x = 0),
the charges of the alkali ions are compensated
by the P(2) units, {P(2)} = {M} and the rest of
the network is formed by the neutral P(3) units,
{P(3)} = 1 −{M}. When x is increased, P(2)
are ﬁrst replaced by B(4) units, because B(4) is
the most favorable NFU type for charge com-
pensation (smallest formation enthalpy of the
negatively charged NFU types). The fraction
of P(3) units does not change. Equations (2a)-
(2c) then yield
{B(4)} = x ,
(5a)
{P(2)} = {M} −x ,
(5b)
{P(3)} = 1 −{M} .
(5c)
The regime terminates when all P(2) units are
substituted at
x1 = {M} .
(6)
One can easily check that the constraint in
Eq. (4) is always fulﬁlled for the fractions in
Eqs. (5a)-(5c) if {M} ≤{M}⋆.
Regime 2 (x1 ≤x ≤x2): Replacement of P(3)
by P(4) and B(4) units. According to the discus-
sion above, more negatively charged B(4) units
can form than are needed for compensating the
alkali ion charges. This holds true as long as
B(4)-B(4) linkages can be avoided.
The addi-
5tional negative charges of B(4) units are com-
pensated by the positive charges of P(4) units.
The network is now formed by B(4), P(3) and
P(4) units and Eqs. (2a)-(2c) yield
{B(4)} = x ,
(7a)
{P(3)} = 1 + {M} −2x ,
(7b)
{P(4)} = x −{M} .
(7c)
This regime terminates, if condition (4) be-
comes violated at
x2 = 1
2 −{M}

,
(8)
i.e. when B(4)-B(4) linkages can no longer be
avoided. For {M} = {M}⋆= 3/7 in particular,
it holds x2 = x1 and the regime 2 disappears.
This explains why we expect P(4) units to be
absent for {M} ≥{M}⋆.
Regime 3 (x2 ≤x ≤x3): Replacement of
P(3) by B(3) units. As the fraction of B(4) units
has saturated, B(3) units are replacing P(3) units
now. The network is formed by B(3), B(4), P(3),
and P(4) units.
Equations (2a)-(2c) together
with condition (4) (as equation) yield
{B(3)} = −1

The regime terminates when all P(3) units are
replaced at
x3 = 1
2 + 7
6{M} .
(10)
Regime 4 (x3 ≤x ≤x4): Replacement of P(4)
by B(3) units. Eventually B(3) units replace P(4)
units and the number of B(4) units decreases
to keep the overall charge neutrality. The net-
work is formed by B(3), P(4) and B(4) units and
Eqs. (2a)-(2c) yield
{B(3)} = −1 −{M} + 2x ,
(11a)
{B(4)} = 1 + {M} −x ,
(11b)
{P(4)} = 1 −x .
(11c)
This behaviour continues until at x = 1 the net-
work is built by charged B(4) units with fraction
{B(4)} = {M} and neutral B(3) units with frac-
tion {B(3)} = 1 −{M}.
The predicted variations of the fractions of
NFU types in the four regimes 1-4 are summa-
rized in Table 2.
A few experimental results
for NFU fractions when {M} < {M}⋆= 3/7,
or y < 0.3, are shown in Fig. 2(b). They are
in good agreement with the theoretical predic-
tions.

Site Energy Landscapes
for Charge Transport
The negatively charged NFUs form counter
charges for the mobile alkali ions. If the relative
concentrations of NFU types change, the spa-
tial distribution of the counter charge becomes
modiﬁed and hence the energy landscape for
the ion migration. To describe changes of con-
ductivity activation energies Ea with the glass
composition in alkali borophosphate glasses, we
base our modeling on the hypothesis that the
modiﬁcation of site energies, i.e. the energies of
the mobile ions at their residence sites in the
glass network, plays the decisive role.
In general, when considering a jump of a mo-
bile ion from a site i to a vacant neighboring site
j, the energies ˜ϵi and ˜ϵj of the ion at the initial
and target site matter,1 as well as the saddle
point energy to be surmounted. All these en-
ergies are aﬀected by the NFUs in the environ-
ment of the sites i, j and by the Coulomb inter-
action with the other mobile ions. To assume
that the NFU contribution to the site energies
is decisive, requires the spatial variation of the

alyze the charge transport ﬁnally in a vacancy picture,
where the vacancies have site energies ϵi = −˜ϵi, see be-
low.
6˜ϵi caused by the Coulomb contribution to be
weak compared to that caused by the NFUs. In
addition, the saddle point energies should vary
weakly in comparison to the site energies.
As for the Coulomb interaction, molecular dy-
namics simulations suggest that the assumption
of a weakly ﬂuctuating contribution to the en-
ergetics of ion jumps is better justiﬁed in a “va-
cancy picture”.32–34 In this picture, one consid-
ers the vacancies, i.e. the vacant ion sites as
charge carriers with a negative charge (anal-
ogous to hole conduction in energy bands of
semiconductors).
Only a small fraction f0 of
the ion sites is found to be vacant in molecu-
lar dynamics simulations, with f0 typical in the
range of 3-10%.35–38 Small vacancy concentra-
tions can be expected on thermodynamic rea-
sons, because “defect concentrations” should be
small in melt-grown glasses.39 It was further-
more shown that f0 ≪1 is required to under-
stand the peculiar behavior seen in the internal
friction behavior of mixed alkali glasses.40,41
To construct site energy landscapes in alkali
borophosphate glasses, we follow the approach
in Ref. 14 and consider the two simple-cubic
sublattices of a body-centered cubic lattice. A
two-dimensional sketch of these sublattices is
shown in Fig. 3. One of the sublattices is the
“NFU lattice”. Its “NFU sites” are randomly
occupied by NFUs of diﬀerent types, where each
type occurs with its respective concentration.
On the other sublattice, termed the “M lat-
tice”, we consider the ionic motion to take
place.
A site in this M lattice can be occu-
pied by at most one mobile ion and ionic mo-
tion proceeds by jumps of ions to vacant nearest
neighbor site (as long these are accessible, see
below). As the amount of mobile ions relative
to the total number of NFUs is {M} = y/(1−y)
(see Sec. 2), a fraction y/(1 −y) of all sites
in the M lattice is occupied.
This requires
{M} = y/(1 −y) < 1, meaning that the ap-
plicability of the method is restricted to glass
compositions with y < 1/2. It is possible to
introduce other types of interwoven sublattices
to lift this restriction. As we consider composi-
tions with y = 0.33 and y = 0.4 in Sec. 4 below,
corresponding reﬁnements of the approach are
not necessary here.
Figure 3: Two-dimensional sketch illustrating
the M sublattice with accessible ion sites (open
circles) and blocked sites (crosses), and the
NFU sublattice with sites randomly occupied
by diﬀerent NFUs (with the diﬀerent species
occurring with their respective concentrations).
The arrows indicate how the charge of the
NFUs (see also Fig. 1) is distributed among the
neighboring ion sites.
As for the remaining fraction of unoccupied
sites in the M lattice, not all of these sites
are considered to be accessible for the mobile
ions. This is because the corresponding frac-
tion of vacant sites would be too high (51% for
y = 0.33 and 33% for y = 0.4). In the mod-
eling, we ﬁx the fraction f0, i.e. the number of
vacant sites relative to the number of accessi-
ble residence sites. All remaining unoccupied
sites in the M lattice are blocked. The fraction
of blocked sites (relative to all sites in the M
lattice) is then given by
fbl = 1 −
1
1 −f0
y
1 −y .
(12)
To summarize, for a given f0 in the range 3-
10%, we block a fraction fbl of sites in the M
lattice according to Eq. (12). The other sites
are the accessible residence sites, which we refer
to as “ion sites” in the following.2
To the ion sites are assigned partial charges
in dependence of the surrounding neighboring
NFUs in the NFU lattice, where we take into
2It is possible that ﬁnite clusters of ion sites arise
due to the blocking, which are not connected to the
percolating cluster of ion sites.
7account how charge is localized in the diﬀerent
NFU types (see the red circles in Fig. 1). The
procedure is illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 3.
Consider an NFU of type α with charge qα
and kα nbOs that occupies an NFU site, which
has z ion sites in its immediate surroundings.
This means that z of its 8 nearest neighbor sites
in the M lattice are accessible for the mobile
ions. Among these z ion sites, we select kα ran-
domly and add a partial charge qα/kα to them
(in the rare case z < kα, the NFU is inter-
changed with a charge-neutral one at another
site; all charges of the NFUs can then be dis-
tributed as described). For a negatively charged
B(4) unit without nbO, where the charge qB(4) =
−1 can be viewed as delocalized over all four
oxygens, we add a charge (−1/z) uniformly
to all surrounding ion sites. A P(4) unit with
qP(4) = +1 would be treated analogously, but
for y = 0.33 and y = 0.4, we have {M} > 3/7
and P(4) units do not appear (see Sec. 2).
All partial charges at an ion site i are summed
up to the total charge
Qi =
X
j(i)
qj .
(13)
where the sum over j = j(i) runs over all eight
NFU sites j surrounding the ion site i, and qj
is the partial charge contribution of the NFU
at site j (qj = 0 if the NFU at site j is charge-
neutral).
The total charge Qi gives rise to a site energy
˜ϵ (0)
i
= V0 Qi ,
(14)
where V0 is an energy scale. This scale can be
roughly estimated by the Coulomb interaction
between an alkali ion with positive charge and
an oxygen with negative charge at a distance of
about 2˚A. The precise value V0, however, is not
relevant, when we consider relative changes of
activation energies with the glass composition
in Sec. 4.
To account for additional structural and en-
ergetic disorder, we add ﬂuctuations V0ηi to
the sites energies, where the ηi are uncorrelated
Gaussian random numbers with zero mean and
standard deviation σϵ,
˜ϵi = ˜ϵ (0)
i
+ V0 ηi = V0 (Qi + ηi) .
(15)
The ﬂuctuations have several sources. In par-
ticular they should take into consideration that
sites in a glass are not located on a simple cubic
lattice, and that there is an additional contri-
bution from the Coulomb interaction between
mobile ions (see the discussion above). More-
over, for ion jump rates, whose variation de-
pends only on the site energies, we can think of
the ﬂuctuations to take into account also spatial
variations of the saddle points energies.
As the structure of the glass changes with the
borate to phosphate mixing ratio, the standard
deviation or “disorder parameter” σϵ should de-
pend on x also. However, according to our hy-
pothesis, the redistribution of counter-charges
and associated modiﬁcations of the site ener-
gies should be the main cause of changes in
long-range ion transport properties. Hence, σϵ
should vary only weakly with x. More precisely,
its variation with x should be small compared
to the variations of the ˜ϵ(0)
i
in Eq. (14). In or-
der to see whether the dependence of conductiv-
ity activation energies Ea on x can be captured
without adjusting σϵ for each x, we deliberately
constrain σϵ to a ﬁxed value. It is the only ﬁt
parameter then, when we calculate normalized
values Ea(x)/Ea(0) for diﬀerent mixing ratios x
in the next section.

In a former study,14 it was shown that the
change of Ea(x)/Ea(0) with x in the glasses
0.4Na2O-0.6[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5] could be suc-
cessfully modeled based on the energy land-
scape construction presented in Sec. 3, despite
of its simplicity. The activation energies in the
respective study were obtained by extensive ki-
netic Monte-Carlo (KMC-) simulations with a
Metropolis form of the jump rates of the mo-
bile ions for f0 = 0.1. Using a disorder param-
eter σϵ = 0.3, good agreement with measured
values was obtained, see the ﬁlled (experiment)

The energy scale V0 in real units can be esti-
mated by requiring the measured value Ea(0)
to agree with the simulated one.
This yields
V0 ≃1.29 eV.
Here we will present two analytical ap-
proaches I and II to determine the acti-
vation energy and compare the results to
those obtained earlier by the KMC simula-
tions.
Approach II will be applied also to
lithium borophosphate glasses with compo-
sitions 0.33Li2O-0.67[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5].
For
both analytical approaches we use the vacancy
picture, for which the site energies ϵi have op-
posite sign, ϵi = −˜ϵi.
Method I is based on a simple picture that
has been used in former works.24,42 It is ill-
lustrated in Fig. 5, where we show the dis-
tribution of site energies resulting from our
landscape construction for the glass 0.4Na2O-
0.6[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5] with x = 0.25.

tion of vacancies relative to all accessible sites
is f0 = 0.1. The Fermi energy ϵf indicates the
highest energy of vacant sites in thermal equi-
librium in the low temperature limit T →0.

ergy required for all sites with ϵi ≤ϵc to form a

is the Fermi energy.3 Due to thermal ﬂuctua-
tions, vacancies can move through the “whole
system” (long range diﬀusion corresponding to
dc-conductivity), where at low temperatures
the respective diﬀusion path should consist of
all sites with energies ϵi below a critical value
ϵc. This critical value is the lowest one, where
a connected path of sites with energies be-
low a given threshold ϵth can form, i.e. ϵc =
minϵth(set of sites with ϵi ≤ϵth is percolating).
The conductivity activation energy is then
given by
Ea = ϵc −ϵf .
(16)
We have determined both the Fermi energy
ϵf and the critical energy ϵc by generating site
energy landscapes in systems (M lattices) with
1003 sites. The determination of ϵf is straight-
forward and for determining the critical energy
ϵc we used the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm of

vacancy, i.e. the Fermi statistics applies to the vacancies
as well.
9percolation theory.43 Once the algorithm is im-
plemented, the calculation of one value of Ea
takes just a few minutes on a standard personal
computer.
The normalized Ea(x)/Ea(0) calculated for
the
glasses
0.4Na2O-0.6[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5]
with approach I is shown in Fig. 4 (red line)
for the ﬁxed value f0 = 0.1 formerly used in
the KMC simulations.
The agreement with
the KMC results (open symbols) is good for
x ≲0.3, but for larger mixing ratios the ac-
tivation energy is overestimated. At x ∼= 0.9,
the predicted Ea(x) exhibits a local maximum,
while the KMC results indicate a local mini-
mum. Hence, model I does not give a satisfac-
tory prediction of Ea(x) for all x.
In approach II, we make use of the fact that
the hopping transport in a Fermionic lattice gas
with site energy disorder can be mapped onto
an eﬀective single particle hopping model in a
landscape, where all site energies are equal, and
the energetic disorder is completely transferred
to the jump barriers (this model corresponds
also to a random conductance network).25 The
barrier ∆ij for a jump from site i to a nearest-
neighbor site j is given by
∆ij = 1
2 (|ϵi −ϵj| + |ϵi −ϵf| + |ϵj −ϵf|) . (17)
Note that the barriers are symmetric, ∆ij =
∆ji, and that the vacancy concentration enters
via the Fermi energy ϵf. Bonds in the M lattice
connected to blocked sites are assigned inﬁnite
barriers.
The activation energy follows by considering
all bonds (ij) with ∆ij below a threshold value
∆th. It holds
Ea = ∆c ,
(18)
where ∆c is the critical smallest value of
the thresholds, where the bonds with ∆ij ≤
∆th still form a percolating path, i.e. ∆c =
min∆th(set of bonds (ij) with ∆ij ≤∆th is per-
colating).
Figure 6 shows as an example the distribu-
tion of barriers calculated from Eq. (17) for the
same energy landscape used in Figure 5. The
critical barrier ∆c indicated by the red vertical
line was determined again by using the Hoshen-

percolation was evaluated.
The activation energies from approach II are
shown in Fig. 4 as blue line and agree well with
the KMC results for all mixing ratios x. Small
deviations can be attributed to uncertainties in
the Ea values calculated from the KMC simu-
lations. Hence, conductivity activation energies
can now be calculated very quickly without the
need to perform extensive KMC simulations for
various temperatures and subsequently extract-
ing Ea from Arrhenius plots.
Let us apply the procedure to another se-
ries of alkali borophosphate glasses, namely
the lithium conducting ones with compositions
0.33Li2O-0.67[xB2O3–(1-x)P2O5]. Experimen-
tal results for NFU concentrations (see Fig. 2)
and conductivity activation energies for these
glasses were reported in Ref. 27. To construct
site energy landscapes for them, we take two
ﬁxed values f0 = 0.05 and f0 = 0.1 of the va-
cancy fraction in order to see, whether the spe-
ciﬁc value of f0 is important. To determine the
disorder parameter σϵ, we require Ea(1)/Ea(0)
to match the experimental value for each of the
two considered f0 values. This means that σϵ
is solely determined by the phosphate (x = 0)
and borate (x = 1) glass.

to match the experimental value Ea(1)/Ea(0)
(σϵ = 0.44 for f0 = 0.05 and σϵ = 0.49 for
f0 = 0.1).
Ea(x)/Ea(0) with the network former mixing
ratio is then a prediction of the theoretical mod-
eling, i.e. not aﬀected by any parameter ﬁtting.
We ﬁnd σϵ = 0.44 for f0 = 0.05 and a slightly
larger value σϵ = 0.49 for f0 = 0.1. The pre-
dicted behavior for Ea(x)/Ea(0) as a function of
x (red line for f0 = 0.05, blue line for f0 = 0.1)
is shown in Fig. 7 and compares very well with
the measured data (symbols). When calculat-
ing V0 in real units by requiring the measured
value Ea(0) to agree with the simulated one, we
obtain the estimates V0 ≃0.69 eV for f0 = 0.05
and V0 ≃0.80 eV for f0 = 0.1. Let us note that
we checked also the robustness against changes
of f0 in our modeling of the sodium borophos-
phate glasses considered in Fig. 4.

Summary
and
Conclu-
sions
For alkali borophosphate glasses, we derived an-
alytical results for NFU concentrations, con-
structed site energy landscapes based on the
concentrations and charges of the NFUs, and
calculated conductivity activation energies from
these landscapes by applying a method, which
requires only a simple and quick determina-
tion of Fermi and critical percolation energies.
The results for the predicted NFU concentra-
tions and activation energies compare well with
experimental data.
We thus regard our the-
oretical approach as a promising step forward
toward relating structure to transport proper-
ties in ionically conducting glasses, and toward
developing a theoretical understanding of ion
transport in glasses with quantitive predictive
power.
There is plenty of room for further devel-
opments of the approach. One important re-
ﬁnement will be to incorporate spatial correla-
tions between the NFUs of the various types
in the energy landscape construction.
These
spatial correlations can be measured, for ex-
ample, by applying dipolar recoupling meth-
ods in rotational-echo double-resonance (RE-
DOR) measurements of advanced solid state
NMR27,28,44,45 (for a recent review of solid state
NMR studies on borophophate glasses, see Ref.
46). Another point is to evaluate aspects of the
constructed energy landscapes more directly
with respect to experimental observations, as,
for example, those obtained from the recently
developed method of charge attachment in-
duced transport (CAIT).47,48 Further improve-
ments concern a more detailed modeling of the
local jump dynamics with explicit consideration
of saddle point energies and disorder in the spa-
tial arrangements of ion sites.
The mapping of the (many-body) jump model
with varying site energies to a single parti-
cle model with varying jump barriers more-
over provides insights, why the random barrier
model49,50 is successful to capture the quasi-
universal scaling behavior of conductivity spec-
tra in glasses with one type of mobile ion.51–53 A
11corresponding mapping is not possible if more
than one type of mobile ion is present, as, e.g.,
in mixed alkali glasses. One may thus expect
that conductivity scaling in such glasses is not
observed, which is indeed the case.54 Calcula-
tions of conductivity spectra and preexponen-
tial factors of dc conductivities will be pre-
sented in upcoming work.
