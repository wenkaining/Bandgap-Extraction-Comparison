The vortex state of mesoscopic three-dimensional superconductors is determined using a minimiza-
tion procedure of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy. We obtain the vortex pattern for a mesoscopic
superconducting sphere and ﬁnd that vortex lines are naturally bent and are closest to each other at
the equatorial plane. For a superconducting disk with ﬁnite height, and under an applied magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to its major surface, we ﬁnd that our method gives results consistent with pre-
vious calculations. The matching ﬁelds, the magnetization and Hc3, are obtained for models that
diﬀer according to their boundary properties. A change of the Ginzburg-Landau parameters near
the surface can substantially enhance Hc3 as shown here.

INTRODUCTION
In the last decade the response of a mesoscopic su-
perconducting disk to a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld has
been theoretically1,2 and experimentally3 studied. The
small volume to surface ratio of mesoscopic supercon-
ductors brings new and interesting physical properties
such as giant vortices, recently detected thanks to new
advances in small-tunnel-junction technology4. Previous
studies of mesoscopic systems were based on two dimen-
sional (2D) theory, where the superconducting conden-
sate was assumed not to vary along the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld. This assumption is not taken here and
we study ﬁnite size extreme type-II mesoscopic supercon-
ductors using a truly three-dimensional (3D) theoretical
approach previously applied to a bulk superconductor5,6.
Only a few vortices ﬁt inside a mesoscopic supercon-
ductor whereas for a bulk superconductor, with non-
superconducting inclusions inside, the number of vortices
is uncountable. By inclusion we refer to a pinning center
with the size equal to a few multiples of the coherence
length, ξ. These two systems have a similar properties
because of their mesoscopic scale structure. For instance,
giant vortices are naturally found in mesoscopic super-
conductors but not in bulk superconductors, where the
nucleation of a vortex line with multiple magnetic ﬂux
NΦ0 is energetically forbidden and only the nucleation of
N individual vortex lines with Φ0 is possible (Φ0 is the
quantum of ﬂux). However this picture does not hold in
the presence of inclusions. For instance for a bulk super-
conductor, Mkrtchyan and Shmidt7, Buzdin8, and some
of us9,10 have shown that a columnar defect can hold a
multiple magnetic ﬂux NΦ0.
Metastability, matching ﬁelds, occupation numbers
and giant vortices have been experimentally studied in
2D bulk superconductors with inclusions, namely, su-
perconducting ﬁlms with an array of two-dimensional
mesoscopic pinning centers consisting of not fully perfo-
rated holes (blind holes)11, fully perforated holes (open
holes)12,13 and micro holes14,15. A similar 3D bulk super-
conductor with a truly three-dimensional arrangement of
internal inclusions has yet to be experimentally realized
though it has been theoretically studied9,10. Such inter-
nal inclusions are present as a random array16,17 in the
LREBaCuO superconductors (where LRE is a light rare
earth element such as Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) and some of
the present ideas may be useful to explain their unusual
properties. Such internal inclusions bring new features
to vortex physics as just a single one can trap many vor-
tex lines in its neighborhood. The regular array theo-
retical study of the 3D bulk superconductor with inclu-
sions was done in the context of a modiﬁed version of the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Other studies based on
the Ginzburg-Landau theory for 3D systems have been
done, including shells18 and constricted superconducting
wires19 both in the extreme type-II limit.
In this paper we apply the same theoretical approach
to study a mesoscopic superconductor. A 3D lattice of
inclusions turns into a 3D lattice of mesoscopic super-
conductors with the same geometry when the insulat-
ing regions are replaced by superconducting ones and
vice-versa. The 3D lattice of mesoscopic superconduc-
tors becomes a set of individually equivalent mesoscopic
superconductors for a London penetration length much
larger than their size. In this case the local ﬁeld is con-
stant and equal to the applied ﬁeld everywhere. In this
way we obtain the vortex patterns for a single meso-
scopic superconductor, here of a sphere and of a disk. In
the past the vortex patterns of mesoscopic superconduc-
tors were obtained1,2,20,21 in the limit of an extremely
thin ﬁlm.
This condition renders the variation of the
Cooper pair density along the magnetic ﬁeld negligible.
Baelus and Peeters21 studied several diﬀerent ﬂat ge-
ometries typically with thickness 0.1ξ and obtained the
vortex patterns from the two-dimensional GL equations
supplemented by the Saint-James–de Gennes22 bound-
ary conditions at the edge. They considered a Ginzburg-2
Landau parameter, the ratio of the London penetration
to the coherence length, κ = 0.28, and solved the two
GL equations. Here we study a thick disk and compare
our results to theirs21 taking into account that in their
case the magnetic response to an external applied ﬁeld
is much stronger than here. We only report results for
κ →∞although our method is not restricted to this
limit. Notice that for our case the boundary conditions
are truly three-dimensional, and so, imposed in all direc-
tions including perpendicularly to the ﬂat geometry.
The major new results of this paper can be summarized
as follows. (i) We ﬁnd the vortex pattern for a meso-
scopic sphere, with radius Rs = 4.0ξ, a problem whose
solution is beyond the scope of previous 2D techniques.
(ii) We show that a slight change of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameters near the edge can substantially increase the
Hc3 ﬁeld. A thin layer covers the superconductor and
separates it from the outside insulating world. This layer
is also superconducting but with eﬀective GL parameter
slightly diﬀerent from those inside. For a bulk system
the phenomenological GL parameters are known to be
related to the microscopic parameters in the following
way: α0 ∼(kTc)2/ǫF, β ∼(kTc)2/(ǫF n), where Tc is the
critical temperature, ǫF is the Fermi energy, and n is the
electronic density. Similar relations should exist in case
of a mesoscopic superconductor although we don’t obtain
them here. We just show that a decrease near the edges
of the eﬀective Cooper pair mass, m, and of α0, lead to
an enhancement of Hc3. Therefore the present approach
is interesting for a system with a small volume to sur-
face ratio because there a slight change at the boundary
over a distance less or equal to ξ is found here to make
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence. The present approach relies on a
free energy minimization procedure carried in the whole
space, including the world outside the superconductor,
where the order parameter is found to vanish. The de-
cay of the Cooper pair density at the boundary, from a
ﬁnite value inside the mesoscopic superconductor to zero
outside, is treated here. Notice that standard diﬀeren-
tial equation approaches, such as that of Ref. 21, only
treat the volume internal to the superconductor, and do
not treat the order parameter discontinuity at the edge,
from a ﬁnite value to zero at the outside world. In this
paper we study three kinds of boundary conditions and
discuss them in the context of a disk of radius R = 4.0ξ.
Below we provide a short description of the disk and
sphere boundary problems treated here. We chose to give
them names that recall their major features: (i) sharp:
a disk is considered and its boundary treatment is the
standard one used for comparison with all other models.
A coarse grained grid is used and gives a fast and eﬃ-
cient convergence to the ﬁnal conﬁguration. The vortex
states are satisfactorily described here. Its name stems
from the sharp deﬁnition of the edge.
(ii) mesh: this
model is the same as sharp except with a reﬁned grid,
which contains 8.2 times more grid points. (iii) sphere:
a sphere is treated here with the same grid coarseness
along the disk radial direction as in the sharp model.(iv)
BP2D: this is the disk reported by Baelus and Peeters21
using their two-dimensional approach. (v) smooth: this
type of boundary was previously used in Refs. 23,24 for
insulating pinning spheres inside a bulk superconductor
and is used here for the disk. Its major property is that
the supercurrent normal to the surface does not disap-
pear abruptly but over some small region (fraction of ξ).
(vi) step: This model contains a superconducting layer
that sets the disappearance of superconductivity. Thus
there are two concentric disks and we ﬁnd that this in-
termediate layer stabilizes the superconducting state in
the inner disk. This model features a very high Hc3 as
compared to the other models.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we de-
scribe our theoretical approach valid for the following two
complementary situations: (i)superconductor with non-
superconducting inclusions and (ii)mesoscopic supercon-
ductor. In Section III we describe the disk and sphere
boundary models and discuss their properties obtained
through our numerical simulations.
In Section IV we
compare the models and discuss many of their common
features. Finally in Section V we summarize the main
achievements of this work.

THEORETICAL ASPECTS
One of the advantages of the present method is that it
can easily incorporate the shape of the mesoscopic super-
conductor, which is done at the free energy level, given
by the density expansion below,

where ⃗D ≡(¯h/i)⃗∇−q ⃗A/c, q is the Cooper pair charge,
and τ(⃗r) is a step-like function, equal to one inside the
mesoscopic superconductor and zero outside. The τ(⃗r)
contains the geometry of the mesoscopic superconductor.
The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are given
by,

These modiﬁed GL equations automatically incorporate
the appropriate boundary conditions through the step-
like function τ(⃗r), discontinuous at the edge, equal to one
inside, and zero outside, for the mesoscopic superconduc-
tor. The gradient of τ(⃗r) is zero everywhere except at the3
interface, where it diverges. Any ﬁnite and physical so-
lution must obey ⃗∇τ · ⃗Dψ = 0 because this divergence
is proportional to the Dirac delta function. For instance,
along the radial direction of the disk: τ(r) = 1 for r ≤R
and τ(r) = 0 for x > R, thus the derivative becomes
⃗∇τ = ˆr∂τ(r)/∂r = −ˆrδ(r −R). Let f(r) be any function
describing products of the order parameter and its deriva-
tives. The product f(r)∂τ(r)/∂r diverges at the border
and the only way to make it vanish there is through the
condition f(R) = 0. Thus the well-known Saint-James–
de Gennes22 boundary condition, ˆn · ⃗Dψ

n = 0, is re-
covered here. As the superconducting order parameter
is deﬁned everywhere in the unit cell, including outside
the mesoscopic superconductor, where Eq. (1) becomes
F = (1/V ) R dv[ β|ψ|4/2 + ⃗h2/8π ] outside the super-
conducting volume.
It must vanish as a result of the
free energy minimization, and variation with respect to
ψ and ⃗A shows that the minimum is reached for ψ = 0
and ⃗∇× ⃗h = 0 according to Eqs. (2)-(3). It is possi-
ble to obtain more elaborate versions of the GL theory,
such as the one containing a local depression of the criti-
cal temperature through a function Tc(⃗r)9 in Eq. (2). In
this work the free energy is normalized by the constant
F0 = H2
c /8π and all ﬁelds are normalized in terms of
the upper critical ﬁeld, Hc2. Lengths are in units of the
coherence length, ξ(T ) =
q
¯h2/2mα0(Tc −T ), and the
density |ψ|2 is normalized by (α0(Tc −T )/β), such that
its maximum value of 1 is reached, for instance, inside
a bulk superconductor (no boundaries) for zero applied
ﬁeld.
We stress some diﬀerences in the application of the
present method to the two complementary problems. For
the former case the magnetic induction, ⃗B =
R
dv ⃗h/V ,
is constant whereas for the latter the applied ﬁeld ⃗H is
constant. In the former case the unit cell edges are fully
inside the superconductor and this introduces into the
theory integers associated to the periodic boundary con-
ditions imposed by the unit cell. These integers follow
the condition that the order parameter be single-valued.
Though |ψ|2 and ⃗h are periodic, ψ and ⃗A only need to
coincide at the unit cell surfaces up to a gauge transfor-
mation, whose expression gives room to introduce these
integers.
ψ(⃗r + ⃗Lµ) = e
i2π
φ0 Λµ(⃗r)ψ(⃗r)
(4)
⃗A(⃗r + ⃗Lµ) = ⃗A(⃗r) + ∇Λµ(⃗r)
(5)
where Lµ is the unit cell length, Λµ(⃗r) is a scalar gauge
function and µ = x, y or z. The minimization procedure
shows that such integers are nothing but the number of
vortices in the unit cell, and the magnetic induction is
fully determined by them. However for the complemen-
tary problem, the mesoscopic superconductor is fully in-
side the unit cell and its boundaries are away from the
unit cell edges. Consequently there is no single-valued
condition on the order parameter and so, these integers
do not exist at all. Consequently, the independent ther-
modynamic ﬁeld in this case, which is the applied ﬁeld
⃗H, varies continuously.
Since there are no screening currents the local ﬁeld, de-
ﬁned as ⃗h = ⃗∇× ⃗A, is the external applied ﬁeld ⃗h = ⃗H. In
this large κ limit the magnetization is directly determined
from ⃗M = const
R
dv ⃗r × ⃗J, where ⃗J is the supercur-
rent. An extra condition determines the remaining free
parameter const, and consequently the demagnetization
constant D of the mesoscopic superconductor: for small
⃗H, that is, in the Meissner phase, we impose the condi-
tion that ⃗H +4πD ⃗M = 0. In contrast, in the approach of
Baelus and Peeters21 for ﬁnite κ, the magnetization is di-
rectly obtained from the diﬀerence between the magnetic
induction and the applied ﬁeld.
The minimization of the GL free energy, done nu-
merically through the so-called Simulated Annealing
method25,26, is carried in a discrete three-dimensional
space.
The free energy is adapted to keep its gauge
invariance in this discrete space.
A cell, that consists
of an orthorhombic box containing Nx.Ny.Nz points for
this purpose.
Every point in this cell, belonging to
the mesoscopic superconductor or not, has associated
to it the ﬁelds ψ(nx, ny, nz), and ⃗A(nx, ny, nz), where
nx = 1, . . . , Nx, ny = 1, . . . , Ny, and nz = 1, . . . , Nz.
The physical volume of the box is Lx · Ly · Lz, where
Lx = ax(Nx −1), Ly = ay(Ny −1) and Lz = az(Nz −1).
The distance between two consecutive points along the
axes of the box is ax, ay, and az. The discrete theory,
given by Eq. (6), properly describes the properties of the
continuous theory under the condition that ξ be much
larger than ax, ay, and az, the grid resolution.
In the discrete free energy, given by Eq. (6), grid
points outside and inside the mesoscopic superconduc-
tor are coupled through gradient terms. For instance in
case of no applied ﬁeld, this coupling is proportional to
|ψ′
out −ψin|2. The fact that ψ′
out →0 causes ψin to get a
lower value than deep inside the sample, where the kinetic
energy vanishes as the order parameter is the same in all
points. For this reason the density |ψ|2 never reaches its
maximum bulk value due to the small volume to surface
ratio.4

COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT
MODELS
The models introduced in Section I have their prop-
erties summarized in Tables I and II and some of their
free energy and magnetization properties are described
in Tables III and
IV, respectively. The function τ(⃗r)
is taken as the product of independent orthogonal direc-
tion functions for all models studied here.
Below is a
summary of their features. (i) sharp: This model treats
the boundaries of a disk of radius R = 4.0ξ and height
d = 1.0ξ through a τ(⃗r) function, 1 inside and 0 out-
side, both along the radial and the major axis direction:
τ(⃗r) = τρ(ρ)·τd(z). (ii) mesh: The same disk and bound-
aries of the sharp model is treated here but with a denser
grid, 61 × 61 × 26 instead of 41 × 41 × 7. (iii) sphere -
This model treats a sphere with stepwise τ(⃗r) function
such as in the sharp model. (iv) BP2D: This is the disk
of Ref. 21.
It has a 0.1ξ height and a 128 × 128 × 1
grid is used. Although of its two-dimensional treatment
it contains 1.4 times more grid points than the three-
dimensional sharp disk model.
(v) smooth:
For this
model a larger height is taken, 2.0ξ, to help stabilize
the order parameter inside the disk.
The smoothness
of τd(z), which reaches values below 1 inside the region
|z| ≤d/2), tends to downgrade the order parameter in-
side the disk. For our numerical study we selected, for the
exponential parameter of Table I, N=8. (vi) step: The
height is d = 1.5ξ and the τ(⃗r) function varies stepwise,
taking values 0, 0.8 and 1. The choice of intermediate
value 0.8 is rather arbitrary and we have found that low-
ering this intermediate value to 0.5, for instance, causes a
substantial increase of Hc3, as compared to here. Thus a
drop of τ near the border, and so of the corresponding GL
parameters, can severely aﬀect Hc3.
Fig. 1 shows the
normalized density for zero applied ﬁeld (Meissner phase)
versus the distance from the geometric center of the disk
along the radial direction, and in case of the sphere, this
distance is along the radial direction inside the equato-
rial plane. For clarity the six models considered here were
split into two subsets shown in diﬀerent plots. For com-
parison purposes the BP2D model is shown in both plots
(red). Notice that for the BP2D model, as well as for the
sphere, the maximum density is 1.0, but not for the other
disk models whose maximum density is about 0.8. The
sphere has a larger volume than the disk, and so, the
surface is not so eﬀective to alter the order parameter in
its center.
In presence of an applied ﬁeld the numerical simulation
is carried in the following way. For zero applied ﬁeld a
random conﬁguration of the order parameter is assumed
inside the cell and a search for the minimum of the free
energy is carried out. The applied ﬁeld is increased at
constant steps and for a given ﬁeld one assumes as the
starting order parameter conﬁguration the one found for
the previous ﬁeld. This procedure is carried sequentially
until the last critical ﬁeld, Hc3, is reached and the order
parameter vanishes everywhere. Next the applied ﬁeld is
lowered backwards to zero applied ﬁeld. A typical feature
of mesoscopic superconductors1,2 is a saw-tooth structure
for the descending ﬁeld of magnetization curve. The two
curves do not coincide, the ascending one has a stronger
diamagnetic signal than the descending curve. The meso-
scopic superconductor exhibits hysteresis as observed, e.
g., in Al disks3, and theoretically obtained in previous
studies1,21. Metastability is also found in the complemen-
tary problem of bulk superconductors with inclusions5,6.

magnetization
curves

intersecting lines and result from ancestor curves that

saw-tooth structure is a sum of segments, which are parts
of the independent non-intersecting lines. Two consecu-
tive segments are connected by a vertical jump. The rea-
son for such vertical jumps resides in the free energy curve
which also consists of independent but intersecting lines.
In fact these intersections deﬁne the so-called matching
ﬁelds which correspond to cross-sections of free energy
lines of neighboring states.
Above the matching ﬁeld
the free energy of the higher state is lower than that of
the preceding one and thus the higher state is preferred.
This is also the reason for the saw-tooth character of the
hysteresis curve. Depending on how the numerical pro-
cedure is carried (the magnetic ﬁeld step, the simulated
annealing temperature, etc) one obtains a diﬀerent saw-
tooth structure that always falls over the same set of inde-
pendent non-intersecting lines. The presence of distinct
lines in the magnetization and free energy curves reveals
a parameter that remains constant upon ﬁeld sweep. A
look at the order parameter phase reveals that it takes
variations from 0 to 2π and the number of such varia-
tions remains constant throughout a magnetization line.
Thus this parameter is the total angular momentum L1,2.
Along any of these lines the angular momentum remains
constant, such that each line can be labeled by L. For

ascending ﬁeld the vortex pattern moves from L inde-
pendent vortices at low ﬁeld to giant vortex states at
high ﬁeld, whose total angular momentum must add to
L. Therefore the present method is able to reproduce
the well-known features of mesoscopic superconductors
found by other authors using diﬀerent approaches1,21.
Table III shows the matching ﬁelds hL L+1 between
two nearest angular momentum states for the six models
considered here. Table IV is useful for model comparison,
as it shows the maximum value of −4πDML/Hc2 for each
L lines and its corresponding applied ﬁeld hL/Hc2.

DISCUSSION
In this section we compare all models to the sharp
boundary model for the mesoscopic disk whose proper-
ties are shown in Tables III and IV. The eﬀect of the
number of grid points in our calculations can be checked
in Fig. 2 as the mesh model has 8.2 times more grid
points than the sharp model.
The mesh model has a
lower free energy and a higher magnetization than the
sharp model, but their values diﬀer by less than one per
cent. Eﬀects due to the grid become only noticeable for

intermediate ﬁelds, but not in the single vortex region.
The comparison between sharp and mesh shows that the
present numerical approach is robust and displays very
little quantitative dependence on the grid. Fig. 2 also
shows the iso-density three-dimensional plots of four typ-
ical vortex conﬁgurations selected to display 1, 2, 3 and 4
vortex states, respectively. Their corresponding applied
ﬁeld, magnetization and free energy values can be read
FIG. 2: (Color online) The sharp (red) and the mesh disks
free-energy and magnetization curves are shown here.
Iso-
density plots for selected applied ﬁelds are shown here to illus-
trate the ﬁrst four cases of vortex patterns found for the thick
disk. The three-dimensional ﬁgures are iso-contours taken at
20% of the maximum density |ψ|2. Each iso-contour is a single
surface, the sum of the vortices and the external surface.
from Fig. 2.
Fig. 3 shows results of the magnetization and free
energy for the sphere model, and also for the sharp
disk model.
Three-dimensional iso-density and two-
dimensional contour plots are shown for four selected
vortex conﬁgurations, whose location is indicated in the
free-energy curve. These four vortex conﬁgurations illus-
trate general features of the vortex lines inside the sphere.
A vortex line must reach the surface perpendicularly in
order to avoid a supercurrent component pointing out-
wards the surface27,28. Because of the small volume to
surface ratio of this Rs = 4.0ξ sphere, the vortex lines
are strongly aﬀected by this surface eﬀect and as a result
they are curved everywhere inside the sphere. The lines
are closely packed in the equatorial plane as shown by
the three-dimensional iso-density plots. These plots are
drawn at 20% of the maximum order density and each
plot consists of a single iso-density surface. The north
pole part of these plots provide a view of the vortex be-
havior at the surface, but the translucent properties of
these three-dimensional plots make it diﬃcult to have
the same view at the south-pole. Fig. 3 also shows two-
dimensional contour plots associated to two selected cuts
of the sphere, taken at the equatorial (half-plane) and
half-way between the north (or south) pole and the equa-
tor planes (quarter-plane). These contour plots contain
ten contour regions, shown in diﬀerent colors, ranging
from maximum density (red) to minimum density (blue).
They also show that the vortex lines are closely packed
at the equatorial plane and also that the vortex core is
larger near the surface than inside the sphere. The sphere
has a stronger magnetic signal as compared to the disk
for low ﬁelds, but for high ﬁelds up to Hc3 the situation
turns and the disk acquires a stronger signal. In fact the
sphere only supports 9 vortex states whereas the disk 12
states.
As the ﬁeld increases the vortex conﬁguration
in case of the sphere disappears faster than in the disk,
probably due to the existence of vortex lines of diﬀerent
lengths.7
FIG. 3: (Color online) The sphere and the sharp (red) disk free-energy and magnetization curves are shown in the right panels.
Three-dimensional iso-density plots and two dimensional density contour plots of |ψ|2 are also shown in the right panels. Each
three-dimensional iso-contour is a single surface, made of the sum of the vortices and the external surface. Two-dimensional
contour plots are taken at the half (equatorial) and at the quarter plane that cuts the sphere perpendicularly to the applied
ﬁeld direction.
Fig. 4 shows comparative analysis of the free energy
and magnetization curves to the sharp model for the
BP2D, step, and smooth models. (i)BP2D-sharp: Their
diﬀerent κ values yield signiﬁcantly diﬀerent magnetiza-
tion curves.
The BP2D model has a very strong dia-
magnetic signal lower free energy states, because it has
a more eﬀective shielding to the applied ﬁeld. Neverthe-
less the models show qualitative similarities. They both
have the same number of 12 angular momentum states,
as shown in Table III, and present a fair agreement be-
tween matching ﬁelds in the high ﬁeld region. This is
explained by the weakening of the diamagnetic currents
for high ﬁeld that turns the (BP2D) similarly to the sharp
model.(ii)step-sharp: The presence of an intermediate re-
gion at the boundary enlarges surface eﬀects as compared
to the sharp case. The diamagnetic response is stronger,
and the free energy is lower, in all L lines and in fact it
allows for two extra vortex states, according to Table III.
These features are not a consequence of a slight diﬀer-
ence in height between the two models.(iii)smooth-sharp:
The smooth model treats the boundary diﬀerently from
sharp in case the smooth τ function decay takes place
over a distance larger than the mesh parameters ax, ay,
and az. This is the case here but we ﬁnd no substan-
tial change in behavior by using the smooth model. This
boundary was extensively used in previous problems of a
superconductor with a periodic array of inclusions5,6.

CONCLUSION
The vortex patterns of truly three-dimensional meso-
scopic superconductors, namely a disk and a sphere, were
analyzed. They were obtained by numerical minimiza-
tion (Simulated Annealing) of a modiﬁed GL free energy
that already incorporates the boundary conditions. This8

procedure provides an eﬃcient way to obtain vortex pat-
terns in mesoscopic superconductors and needs relatively
few grid points.
The method is stable under changes
of the grid size, and for a two-dimensional disk it repro-
duces results of disk geometry previously studied by other
methods21). We ﬁnd that slight changes of the boundary
conditions, like the creation of a surface layer, increases
the upper critical ﬁeld and allows for an increase in the
number of angular momentum states. In case of a meso-
scopic sphere we ﬁnd that the vortex lines are naturally
curved due to strong surface eﬀects as was recently also
found in a wire with a constriction19.
