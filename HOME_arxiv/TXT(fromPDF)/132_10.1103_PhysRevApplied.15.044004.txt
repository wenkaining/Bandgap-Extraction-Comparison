We present a surface passivation method that reduces surface-related losses by almost two orders of magnitude
in a highly miniaturized GaAs open microcavity. The microcavity consists of a curved dielectric distributed
Bragg reﬂector (DBR) with radius ∼10 µm paired with a GaAs-based heterostructure. The heterostructure
consists of a semiconductor DBR followed by an n-i-p diode with a layer of quantum dots in the intrinsic
region. Free-carrier absorption in the highly doped n- and p-layers is minimized by positioning them close to
a node of the vacuum electromagnetic-ﬁeld. The surface, however, resides at an anti-node of the vacuum ﬁeld
and results in signiﬁcant loss. These losses are much reduced by surface passivation. The strong dependence
on wavelength implies that the main eﬀect of the surface passivation is to eliminate the surface electric
ﬁeld, thereby quenching below-bandgap absorption via a Franz-Keldysh-like eﬀect. An additional beneﬁt is
that the surface passivation reduces scattering at the GaAs surface. These results are important in other
nano-photonic devices which rely on a GaAs-vacuum interface to conﬁne the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION
Concepts in cavity quantum-electrodynamics (QED)
can be implemented using semiconductors.
A semi-
conductor based microcavity can be created using a
micropillar1–3, a photonic crystal cavity4,5, a whispering-
gallery resonator6, and an open microcavity7–9. Quan-
tum dots within these structures mimic atoms. In the
limit of a single quantum dot (QD), a single-photon
source can be realized by exploiting the weak-coupling
regime of cavity-QED10. The strong-coupling regime of
cavity-QED has been accessed with three diﬀerent mi-
crocavity platforms1,4,9.
In all these semiconductor-based applications of cavity-
QED, minimizing the absorption and scattering losses
in the microcavity is very important. For single-photon
sources operating in the weak-coupling regime, an eﬃ-
cient photon extraction from the microcavity is essen-
tial2,3.
In the strong-coupling regime, a coherent ex-
change between an exciton in the QD and a photon in
the micro-cavity is only possible if the exciton-photon
coupling exceeds the rate of photon loss. Typically, this
requires the development of low-mode volume, high Q-
factor microcavities. A recurring theme in the develop-
ment of such microcavities is the role of the GaAs sur-
face. At the semiconductor surface, the symmetry of the
lattice is broken. The GaAs surface is quite complex –
there are a number of possible surface reconstructions,
and a thin oxide layer typically forms on exposure to

air11. Reducing surface-related absorption is crucial in
the development of GaAs-based cavity-QED.
Recently, considerable success in implementing cavity-
QED was reported with a QD in an open microcav-
ity7–9,12. The “bottom” mirror is a semiconductor dis-
tributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR), the “top” mirror a
curved, dielectric DBR. The position of the bottom mir-
ror can be tuned in situ with respect to the top mirror,
allowing a single QD to be brought into resonance with
the microcavity mode. In the latest developments, the
QDs are embedded in an n-i-p diode9,12. Both n- and p-
doped GaAs result in free-carrier absorption13. To min-
imize the absorption within the microcavity, the n- and
p-doped layers are made as thin as possible and are po-
sitioned close to the node of the vacuum electric ﬁeld.
This technique, positioning an absorbing layer at a vac-
uum ﬁeld node, can also be used to reduce losses at the
GaAs surface. But in this case, it involves a serious com-
promise.
If there is a node at the surface, the largest
vacuum electric ﬁeld lies in the vacuum-gap and not in
the GaAs material on account of interferences in the de-
vice. This reduces considerably the coupling of a QD to
the vacuum electric ﬁeld. An acceptably large coupling
is only possible if there is a vacuum ﬁeld anti-node at the
surface. Success with the n-i-p devices in an open micro-
cavity was only possible after passivating the surface9,12.
The role played by the passivation is elucidated here.
We probe the surface-related absorption in a GaAs
open microcavity.
The main diagnostic tool is a mea-
surement of the wavelength dependence of the Q-factor.
With an untreated surface, we ﬁnd that the Q-factor is
modest, approximately 104 at the stopband center, much
lower than the value expected from the mirror designs.
Following surface passivation, we ﬁnd that the Q-factor

culated vacuum-ﬁeld amplitude across the heterostructure for

position with wavelength thereby changing the modal con-
ﬁnement factor (MCF) in the GaAs capping layer, surface-
related absorption in the capping layer (10−10–10−8 cm−1)
can be probed via the microcavity by measuring its Q-factor
across the SB. Note that at λC, where the coupling to the QDs
is maximized, free-carrier absorption in the highly doped p-
and n-gates is minimized by placing them close to a vacuum-
ﬁeld node. Note also that the highly reduced vacuum-ﬁeld
at λ −λC = −30 nm arises as at this wavelength, the largest
vacuum electric-ﬁeld is located in the vacuum gap.
increases to ≃106 at the stopband center, close to the
value expected from the mirror designs. This shows that,
ﬁrst, the dominant loss mechanism in the untreated case
is related to the GaAs surface, and second, that surface
passivation remedies this loss. For the untreated surface,
the Q-factor has a very strong dependence on wavelength,
increasing rapidly on tuning to lower wavelengths. By
comparing the Q-factor to the result of model calcula-
tions, we ﬁnd that we can account quantitatively for the
Q-factor by ascribing the loss to absorption in the cap-
ping layer, the ﬁnal 55-nm-thick GaAs layer of the het-
erostructure. The absorption in the capping layer is an
exponential function of the photon energy, pointing to
Franz-Keldysh-like absorption induced by a strong elec-
tric ﬁeld at the surface14–18. In turn, this demonstrates
the main role of the surface passivation layer in this de-
vice: it reduces the surface electric ﬁeld, thereby much
reducing the Franz-Keldysh (F-K) absorption. The stan-
dard analytic result for the F-K eﬀect describes the ab-
sorption at the unpassivated surface but with an electric
ﬁeld much higher than in the standard picture (mid-gap
pinning).
II.
THE OPEN, TUNABLE MICROCAVITY
The microcavity7,19 consists of a curved dielectric DBR
– the template is produced by CO2-laser ablation20 –
paired with an “nip-DBR” semiconductor heterostruc-
ture. The InAs QDs are embedded in the intrinsic part of
the n-i-p diode; the diode resides on top of a semiconduc-
tor DBR, Fig. 1(a). We employ two dielectric top DBRs.
The ﬁrst (DBR-I) is composed of 22 pairs of SiO2(λ/4)
and Ta2O5(λ/4) (where λ depicts the wavelength in each
material) and is terminated with SiO2.
The stopband
(SB) center21 is 973 nm. The second (DBR-II) is com-
posed of 15 pairs of SiO2(λ/4) and Ta2O5(λ/4), Ta2O5
terminated, and has its SB center at 930 nm. The semi-
conductor DBR consists of 46 pairs of AlAs(λ/4) and
GaAs(λ/4). The heterostructure is a 1.5λ-layer of GaAs
including doped layers acting as top-gate (p++, 1019
cm−3) and back-gate (n+, 2 · 1018 cm−3). The QD layer
is placed at an antinode of the vacuum electric ﬁeld (at
a distance λ below the surface). The intrinsic region be-
tween QDs and back-gate acts as tunnel barrier for elec-
trons and ensures that the QDs operate under Coulomb
blockade at low temperature22. Using a piezo-based XYZ
nano-positioner, the microcavity features full in situ tun-
ability at cryogenic temperatures.
A measurement of the Q-factor across the SB of the
nip-DBR (Fig. 1(b)) reveals possible sources of loss in the
heterostructure due to the fact that the standing wave
inside the cavity shifts with wavelength (Fig. 1(c)). For
instance, losses in the capping layer depend on the exact
wavelength: at a wavelength-detuning of (−30, 0, 30) nm
with respect to the nip-DBR’s SB center, the calcu-
lated modal conﬁnement factor (MCF – deﬁned as the
vacuum electromagnetic-energy conﬁned in the layer-of-
interest divided by the zero-point energy, ¯hω/2, i.e. the
total energy of the vacuum-ﬁeld mode.)
of the cap-
ping layer is (0.9%, 6.2%, 0.9%), respectively.
There-
fore, if the dominant loss mechanism in the microcavity
takes place within the capping layer then the change in
MCF will result in a strong dependence of the Q-factor
across the stopband. Furthermore, by characterizing the
mirrors carefully and by simulating the entire structure
with transfer-matrix calculations, measurements of the
Q-factor not only reveal the location of the dominant
loss process but can also be used to determine the loss
quantitatively.
III.
GaAs SURFACE PASSIVATION
Surface passivation of GaAs replaces the native ox-
ide with a thin Al2O3 layer6,23.
The surface passiva-
tion recipe follows in part one of the procedures de-3
scribed in Ref.24. As a ﬁrst cleaning step, the processed
semiconductor sample (already containing Au contact
pads) is successively immersed in acetone, isopropanol
and ethanol inside an ultrasonic bath at T = 40 ◦C.
To prevent surface treatment of the contact pads, they
are covered by a manually applied drop of photoresist
(AZ1512HS, Microchemicals GmbH) and baked for 10
min at T = 100 ◦C. At room temperature, the sample is
dipped into an HCl solution (25%) for 1 min in order to
remove the native oxide24,25. The sample is then rinsed
with deionized water for ∼1 s and immediately immersed
in an (NH4)2S solution (20%) for 10 min. This proce-
dure passivates the surface with sulfur26,27, preventing
the native oxide from reforming. The S-layer is however
not robust. For this reason, it is removed and replaced
with an Al2O3 layer. To achieve this, on emerging from
the (NH4)2S solution, the sample is blown dry with ni-
trogen and immediately transferred into an atomic-layer
deposition (ALD) chamber (Savannah 100, Cambridge
NanoTech Inc.).
The following ALD recipe is chosen to deposit ∼8 nm
of Al2O3 onto the sample surface: T = 150 ◦C, ﬁrst pulse
50 ms (water), wait 12 s, second pulse 40 ms (TMA), wait
10 s; the cycle is repeated 80 times. The Al2O3 layer
acts as diﬀusion barrier for oxygen29, thus preventing
reoxidation of the etched GaAs surface.
After surface passivation, the remaining challenge is
to remove the photoresist that has been cross-linked due
to the high temperature, T = 150 ◦C, inside the ALD
chamber.
The use of N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)
at elevated temperatures was shown to remove success-
fully the cross-linked photoresist.
The sample is im-
mersed in NMP for 9–20 h (20 h yielded a better result)
at T = 40 ◦C and then successively cleaned for 5 min in
NMP, acetone, isopropanol and methanol inside an ultra-
sonic bath at T ∼56 ◦C. As a ﬁnal step, a polymeric strip
coating (First Contact, Photonic Cleaning Technologies)
is used to remove any ﬁnal residues from the sample sur-
face.
IV.
INDIVIDUAL MIRROR CHARACTERIZATION
Each DBR has a high reﬂectance for wavelengths
within the stopband (SB). Outside the stopband, there
are oscillations in the reﬂectivity as a function of wave-
length. These oscillations are sensitive to the exact layer
thicknesses in the particular mirror – this dependence is
exploited to characterize the layers in each DBR.
As depicted in Fig. 2, the cavity’s top and bottom
mirrors are characterized at T = 4.2 K by a broadband
light-source (white light-emitting-diode or halogen lamp)
and a dark-ﬁeld confocal microscope28. The light from
the source is coupled into a single-mode optical ﬁber,
the output of which is collimated and focussed onto the
sample surface with an objective lens (NA=0.55). Cross-
polarizing elements are used in the beam path to reject
all but the light reﬂected from the sample surface. The

Each mirror is investigated by recording the spectrum of

focal microscope28. Via 1D transfer matrix methods (Essen-
tial Macleod), the designed layer thicknesses can be reﬁned
to ﬁt the experimentally observed oscillations. (a) Dielectric

few microns).
detection ﬁber is connected to a spectrometer28. The re-
ﬂected light from a metallic mirror, the Au contact pad
in the case of the nip-DBR, is used to record a refer-
ence spectrum. The nip-DBR’s reﬂectance spectrum is
obtained by dividing its reﬂected spectrum by the refer-
ence spectrum. Due to the absence of a metallic reference
surface on top of the dielectric DBR-I in Fig. 2(a), an ex-
ponential ﬁt of the reference spectrum from Fig. 2(b) is
used instead and the maximum reﬂectance is normalized
to one.
Via 1D transfer matrix methods (Essential Macleod,
Thin Film Center Inc.) the design layer thicknesses can
be reﬁned in order to ﬁt the reﬂectivity oscillations out-
side the stopband. The obtained models for each DBR
(red solid lines in Fig. 2) provide a convincing descrip-
tion of these oscillations. These mirror descriptions are
then used to simulate the cavity performance, in par-
ticular the Q-factors and transmittance values at reso-4
nance as a function of the vacuum-gap between the mir-
rors (Sec. IX). The slight discrepancy between experi-
ment and model arises from the diﬃculty of recording
precisely a reference spectrum for the white-light source.
V.
MICROCAVITY CHARACTERIZATION: Q-FACTORS
A microcavity is constructed using passivated and
unpassivated semiconductor-DBRs and a curved dielec-
tric DBR (radius of curvature ∼7–16 µm) similar to
the ones characterized in Fig. 2. Via narrowband-laser
transmission-measurements, each microcavity is charac-
terized by determining its Q-factor across the SB of the
semiconductor DBR. The transmission signal is measured
as a function of laser frequency keeping the cavity length
ﬁxed (Fig. 3(a)). To change the cavity’s resonance fre-
quency, the mirror separation is changed by means of the
Z nano-positioner.
A Q-factor is obtained for every pair of longitudi-
nal (TEM00) modes at the minimum mirror separation
(∼2–4 µm, depending on wavelength and mirror-crater
depth19) by ﬁtting a double-Lorentzian.
Fig. 3(a),(b)
show the results for an electrically-contacted passivated
sample30 (black dots), an electrically-uncontacted unpas-
sivated sample (blue triangles) as well as an electrically-
contacted unpassivated sample (red squares), paired with
DBR-I as top mirror. Without passivation, the Q-factor
is around 105 for the electrically-uncontacted unpassi-
vated sample at the SB center, and too low to measure
precisely for the electrically-contacted unpassivated sam-
ple. At a red-shift of 10 nm from the SB center, the Q-
factor for the electrically-contacted unpassivated sample
is on average 3.8 · 104, and 1.28 · 105 for the electrically-
uncontacted unpassivated sample (Fig. 3(a).). These val-
ues are much smaller than the values expected from the
DBRs – they signify that there is a signiﬁcant loss mech-
anism. Around the SB center, where the coupling to the
QD layer is maximized (λC = 915–925 nm), the Q-factors
are strongly decreased by this loss mechanism – the loss
impacts signiﬁcantly the performance of a QD in the mi-
crocavity.
As the wavelength approaches the red-end of the SB,
the Q-factors for the unpassivated samples increase.
There is a pronounced asymmetry with respect to the
SB center: the Q-factors fall monotonically as the wave-
length shifts to the blue with respect to the SB center.
These results imply that the loss mechanism is a strong
function of wavelength.
After passivation, the Q-factor around the SB center
increases. At a red-shift of 10 nm from the SB center,
the Q-factor increases to a very large value, 6.34 · 105
(Fig. 3(a)). Furthermore, the dependence of the Q-factor
on wavelength is much more symmetric with respect to
the SB center. In fact, the decrease on the blue-side re-
ﬂects the decrease in reﬂectivity of the dielectric mirror
which, for fabrication reasons, has a maximum reﬂectiv-
ity at a wavelength of 973 nm.

Evaluated Q-factors for several wavelengths.
Mean values
and standard deviations originate from data from two cav-
ity modes, and up to six measurements.
Two surface-loss
mechanisms are modeled: absorption and scattering.
The
solid lines are calculated Q-factors taking into account free-
carrier absorption (absorption coeﬃcients from Ref.13) and
F-K absorption17,18 for electric ﬁelds in the capping layer
Fcap = (200, 320, 470) kV/cm.
The dotted lines are calcu-
lated taking into account surface scattering
31 only.
For
the passivated case, the black dotted line is modelled with
a roughness at both the GaAs-alumina and alumina-vacuum
interfaces σ = (σGaAs−Al2O3, σAl2O3−vac), and found to be
σ = (0.14, 0.14) nm; alternatively σ = (0.0, 0.55) nm yields
similar results.
In the unpassivated cases, the blue and
red dotted lines are modelled with σGaAs−vac = 0.5 nm and
σGaAs−vac = 1.0 nm at the GaAs-vacuum interface, respec-
tively. Gray solid line is model without any surface losses.
(c) By comparing measured and simulated Q-factors, and as-
suming that the scattering losses are negligible, the absorption
coeﬃcient α can be deduced as a function of photoenergy. α
is ﬁtted to the F-K result using Fcap as ﬁtting parameter.5
The passivation procedure changes the properties of
the surface but leaves the rest of the microcavity un-
changed. The drastic increase of the Q-factors after sur-
face passivation leads therefore to the conclusion that the
losses limiting the Q-factors of unpassivated microcavi-
ties are related to the semiconductor surface. Speciﬁcally,
the loss, either an absorption or scattering mechanism,
originates at the GaAs surface itself or in the GaAs layer
immediately below the surface.
These results were veriﬁed in a second experiment em-
ploying a diﬀerent piece of wafer material from the nip-
DBR. The passivation was carried out in a separate run;
the cavity was constructed with DBR-II as top mirror.
The results are shown in Fig. 4. The results follow closely
those of the ﬁrst experiment, with the advantage that the
Q-factors could be determined also on the blue side of the
SB center.
To quantify the loss, the entire microcavity is mod-
eled (see Sec. IX) using accurate descriptions of the two
DBRs, including the free-carrier absorption in the doped
layers in the heterostructure.
Absorption is added to
the capping layer (GaAs between the p-doping and the
surface) and adjusted to match the experimentally de-
termined Q-factors at each wavelength. This is a robust
procedure as the surface-related loss dominates other loss
channels. The extracted absorption coeﬃcients α from
this procedure are plotted as a function of wavelength in
Fig. 3(c).
In both cases shown in Fig. 3(c) the absorption co-
eﬃcients α are extremely small. From a measurement
point of view, the microcavity represents a very sensi-
tive platform for detecting very weak absorption or scat-
tering events. In a single-pass experiment, these losses
would be very diﬃcult to detect. Signiﬁcantly, we ﬁnd
that α depends exponentially on photon energy in the un-
passivated case, a dependence that rules out scattering
or broad-band absorption as the main loss mechanism at
the surface, as these processes would have a much weaker
dependence on wavelength. Instead, the exponential de-
pendence points to below-gap absorption in an electric
ﬁeld.
VI.
INVESTIGATION OF LOSS VIA SURFACE
ROUGHNESS
In order to conﬁrm that the measured losses on the
heterostructure with doping are indeed a consequence of
the doped layers, and to quantify losses via surface scat-
tering, we compare our results to a microcavity consisting
of a semiconductor heterostructure without doping. The
heterostructure in this case is a λ-layer of GaAs (with
embedded InAs QDs in the center) on top of a 33-pair
AlAs/GaAs DBR7,8,32 It is a high-quality sample but
may not match the ultra-high quality of the semiconduc-
tor heterostructure with doping. Initially, we repeat the
mirror characterization procedure described above and
ﬁnd a suitable model for the semiconductor layer thick-

FIG. 4. Determination of surface-related losses via Q-factor
measurements using DBR-II with an nip-DBR. We probe the
double role of surface passivation. Four positions in the con-
tacted sample are probed: three passivated areas (circles) A,
B, C and an unpassivated region (red squares). Mean val-
ues and standard deviation result from the measurements on
the two cavity modes. We implement a mixed model to ﬁt
the data: F-K-like absorption and reasonable values of sur-
face roughness are probed together. For the passivated re-
gions, surface roughness alone explains the observed data.
We estimate a roughness σ = (σGaAs−Al2O3, σAl2O3−vac) for
each region:
at region A σ = (0.5, 0.5) nm, alternatively
σ = (0.0, 1.0) nm; at region B σ = (0.25, 0.8) nm, alterna-
tively σ = (0.0, 1.4) nm; at region C σ = (0.5, 3.0) nm, al-
ternatively σ = (0.0, 3.75) nm. For the unpassivated region,
surface roughness alone cannot account for the Q-factor de-
pendence on wavelength alone: with a surface roughness of
σGaAs−vac = 0.3 nm, an electric ﬁeld Fcap = 400 kV/cm is
still needed to ﬁt data.
nesses (Fig. 5(a)). Subsequently, we pair this mirror with
the dielectric top mirror DBR-I.
Figure 5(b) depicts the measured Q-factors as a func-
tion of wavelength for the semiconductor heterostructure
without doping.
The Q-factor reaches approximately
105 at the stopband center, and remains constant within
measurement error over a wavelength range of approxi-
mately 20 nm. This behaviour is quite diﬀerent to that
of the unpassivated semiconductor heterostructure with
doping (Fig. 3(b),(c), Fig. 4). The conclusion is that the
strongly wavelength dependent loss process is related to
the doping.
In the absence of losses, the heterostructure-without-
doping – top mirror combination should yield a Q-factor
of 2 × 105 in the stopband center, about a factor of two

gray solid line). The wavelength-dependence of the Q-
factor (Fig. 5(b)) is, as before, a useful diagnostic of
the scattering process. We ﬁnd that in this case, scat-
tering alone at the GaAs-vacuum interface can account6

FIG. 5. Undoped semiconductor heterostructure: reﬂectance
and Q-factor measurements.
(a) Reﬂectance measurement
of a semiconductor heterostructure without doping (λC =
956 nm) at T = 4.2 K. The heterostructure contains a λ-layer
of GaAs on top of 33 pairs of AlAs(λ/4)/GaAs(λ/4). A layer
of QDs is included at the center of the GaAs layer. In or-
der to record a reference spectrum, parts of the sample were
covered by an Au ﬁlm using electron-beam evaporation. (b)

for the measured Q-factors, with a surface roughness
σGaAs−vac = 0.5 nm (Fig. 5(b) red solid line). We simu-
late as well the possible outcome of passivating the un-
doped sample, with σ = (σGaAs−Al2O3, σAl2O3−vac) =
(0.5, 0.5) nm, shown in Fig. 5(b) red dotted line: the ad-
dition of a thin alumina layer would diminish the eﬀect
of surface scattering due to surface roughness, increasing
slightly the expected Q-factor.
A surface roughness σ translates into a total integrated
scatter (TIS) of TIS ≈(4πσ/λ)2 (Ref.33) and can be
modelled by an extinction coeﬃcient k (for the 1D trans-
fer matrix methods) according to Ref.31,

where d = 2σ, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of
the two layers surrounding the scatter layer, and λ is the
free-space wavelength. Including this loss in the simu-
lations reproduces the measured Q-factors convincingly.
Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measure-
ments (tapping mode, Bruker Dimension 3100) indicate
that surface roughness is present in diﬀerent amounts
across samples, as shown in Fig. 6. The undoped wafer
presented a root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness
0.3 ≤σ ≤0.7 nm, the unpassivated bare sample (with-
out contacts) presented 0.2 ≤σ ≤0.9 nm, the unpas-
sivated contacted sample 0.4 ≤σ ≤7.3 nm, and the
passivated sample 0.3 ≤σ ≤1.9 nm. The native sur-
face roughness at the GaAs-vacuum interface, right after
growth of the samples, is on the order of 0.15 to 0.30 nm.
However, increased roughness is caused by processing of
the samples – e.g. via passivating, cleaning and gluing,
bonding.
We speculate that in the unpassivated con-
tacted samples, presented high values of surface rough-
ness might be induced by remnant traces of photoresist
from the processing procedure (which in turn have a low-
ering scattering power than pure GaAs, due to the re-
duced refractive index).
The passivated doped sample also provided an op-
portunity to test the applicability of the TIS result for
loss at a rough interface. The Q-factors measured with
DBR-II at three diﬀerent passivated regions of the sam-
ple presented a weak dependence on wavelength, in con-
trast to the results in the unpassivated region.
The
model with σ = (0.5, 0.5) nm, σ = (0.25, 0.8) nm and
σ = (0.5, 3.0) nm respectively for regions A, B and C re-
produce these Q-factors precisely, with reasonable values
of roughness at each interface (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the
model captures the symmetric inﬂuence of roughness on
the Q-factor with respect to the SB center. This results
from the reduction in the MCF at the sample’s surface,
as presented in Fig. 1(c).
Agreement between the Q-
factors and the simulation gives us conﬁdence that the
description of loss via surface scattering is quantitatively
correct.
The conclusion from this measurement and analysis is
that, not only passivating the surface quenches surface-
related absorption, but also has the beneﬁcial aspect of
reducing loss via surface scattering. The original GaAs
surface and the passivated surface have a similar range of
values of surface roughness. In the passivated case, the
surface loss via scattering is about 60% with respect to
that of the unpassivated sample. The passivation proce-
dure creates a layer with an intermediate refractive index:
it avoids the large jump in refractive index at a GaAs-
vacuum interface. This reduces the total scattering loss.
In the case of the doped unpassivated sample, the
wavelength dependence of the Q-factors is too strong
to be accounted for with scattering loss (Fig. 3(b) and
Fig. 4). A diﬀerent mechanism is clearly at play.7

MICROSCOPIC EXPLANATION FOR THE
NIP-DBR LOSSES
We give a possible microscopic explanation for the
losses in the investigated nip-DBR structure and why sur-
face passivation signiﬁcantly reduces them. In Fig. 7(a),
the calculated valence- and conduction-band edges in the
heterostructure are shown, a solution to the 1D Poisson
equation (obtained via the nextnano software). In the
unpassivated case, we simulate the mid-gap Fermi-level
pinning at the surface via a Schottky barrier of 0.76 eV.
This yields an electric ﬁeld in the capping layer (“capping
ﬁeld”) of Fcap = 140 kV/cm.
An electric ﬁeld in a semiconductor leads to F-K ab-
sorption below the bandgap of the material14,15: owing
to the position-dependence of the band-edges, the elec-
tron and hole wavefunctions can be described by Airy
functions (similar to a particle in a triangular well34)
and acquire an exponential tail at energies within the
bandgap. The electric ﬁeld therefore creates an absorp-
tion processes at photon energies Ephoton < Eg.
The
situation is schematically depicted in Fig. 7(b).
According to the standard model16, F-K absorption at
photon energy E due to the presence of an electric ﬁeld
F can be described via the absorption coeﬃcient

In these equations, β is a constant (arbitrary units), e
is the elementary charge (in SI units), ¯h the reduced
Planck’s constant (in SI units), m0 the free electron
rest mass (in kg), µlh = 0.037m0 (µhh = 0.058m0) the
reduced mass of an electron–light-hole pair (electron–
heavy-hole pair), F is given in kV/cm, the energies Eg
and E in eV and |Mlh|2 (|Mhh|2) the momentum matrix
elements for the light-hole (heavy-hole). Ai(z) is an Airy
function35 (with derivative Ai′(z)).
We make use of the momentum matrix elements de-
rived in Ref.17 for diﬀerent polarizations of the radiation
ﬁeld. For light polarized in the (x, y)-plane, the momen-
tum matrix elements for the light- and heavy-holes read
|Mlh|2 = P 2/3,
(5)
|Mhh|2 = P 2,
(6)
where P = 0.692 (arbitrary units) is a typical value for
GaAs17.
We use this model for F-K absorption to describe
previously reported room-temperature experiments on a
p-i-n double heterostructure18 (Fig. 7(c)), and extract
the value of constant β in Eq. 2, which is found to be
β = 2.5 · 104 (arbitrary units).
These experiments ex-
tend to photon energies far below the bandgap, the case
of interest here. There is a compelling overlap between
theory and experiment.
In order to estimate F-K absorption coeﬃcients in our
nip-DBR at 4.2 K (Fig. 3(b),(c) and Fig. 4), we make use
of Eqs. 2–6, taking the low-temperature GaAs bandgap
of 1.519 eV and β extracted from ﬁtting the data in
Fig. 7(c). We compare the results of the model for low-
temperature F-K absorption to the experimental data
presented in Fig. 3(b),(c), taking the electric ﬁeld F as
a ﬁtting parameter. The exponential dependence of the8

absorption on the photon energy is well described with
F-K absorption. However, in the unpassivated case, the
capping ﬁeld is Fcap = 470 kV/cm when not accounting
for any surface roughness (Fig. 3) and Fcap = 400 kV/cm
when accounting for a realistic value of surface roughness
(Fig. 4).
These values are between 3.4 and 2.8 above
that expected from the 1D Poisson equation (Fig. 7(a))
respectively. The origin of this discrepancy is not under-
stood at this point, but we note several points.
First, to the best of our knowledge, there are no F-K
absorption experiments reported in the literature at low
temperature (4.2 K) and at photon energies far below the
bandgap Eg of GaAs (at E −Eg ∼−0.17 eV correspond-
ing to λ ∼920 nm).
Our approach here is to ﬁt the
theory presented in Ref.16,17 to the room temperature
experiments of Ref.18 (Fig. 7(c)) and then to extrapolate
the absorption coeﬃcients to photon energies ∼0.17 eV
below the bandgap. The change in temperature, from
room-temperate to low temperature, is accommodated
by a rigid shift in the absorption spectrum to account for
the increase in the bandgap. It is conceivable that the
standard F-K theory is inadequate at photon energies
far below the bandgap – this point has not been tested
experimentally.
Secondly, there are room-temperature experiments on
F-K oscillations in doped GaAs heterostructures (a 25–
80 nm thick, undoped GaAs capping layer on top of an
n+-doped Al.32Ga.68As layer36) that also report surface
electric ﬁeld values a factor 1.8–3.8 above the expected
ones37.
Thirdly, the F-K model describes a bulk semiconduc-
tor in a uniform electric ﬁeld.
Obviously, it does not
take into account the microscopic details of the surface,
for instance surface reconstructions and oxidation. It is
possible that the details of the surface layer are impor-
tant here.
In the light of this analysis, our proposal is that surface
passivation quenches surface-related absorption primar-
ily by reducing the electric ﬁeld in the capping layer,
thereby eliminating the F-K absorption (within the sen-
sitivity of the experiment).
A remaining question is why the bare-wafer sample
without passivation shows higher Q-factors than the
electrically contacted sample also without passivation
(Fig. 3(b),(c)). The contacting process may change the
surface roughness, as revealed by the AFM measurements
(Fig. 6). The surface roughness per se does not however
account for the Q-factors of the various samples. The
main point is that surface scattering does not account
for the exponential dependence of the loss process on
photon energy (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). Instead, we speculate
that the change in GaAs surface on forming the contacts
results in a change of surface pinning, thereby increasing
the capping ﬁeld. One possibility is that the degradation
of the surface on contacting spreads the available surface
states to lower energies.9
VIII.
MODEL FOR THE CURVED DIELECTRIC
MIRRORS
An interpretation of the microcavity Q-factors in terms
of losses in the semiconductor heterostructure rests on
an understanding of the top mirror.
The top mirrors,
dielectric-DBRs, are of very high quality with very low
loss. To prove this point, we investigate a microcavity
formed from DBR-I and a planar version of DBR-I. The
coatings for the plane mirror and concave mirrors were
applied to the substrates in the same run and are nomi-
nally identical. Fig. 8 shows the measured Q-factors. At
the stopband center of the top mirror (λC = 976 nm),
the Q-factor is extremely high, 1.5 · 106. To describe the
dielectric mirror accurately at the stopband center of the
semiconductor-DBR, we analyze the dependence of the
dielectric-dielectric Q-factor and transmission as a func-
tion of wavelength. To describe the high transmission at
short wavelengths, we are forced to red-shift the stopband
center of the bottom mirror by 3 nm38. A rough interface
at the “lower” surface of the ﬁve “lowest” Ta2O5 layers
shown in Fig. 1 (extinction coeﬃcients corresponding to
an interface roughness31 of 0.25 nm) together with an in-
creased absorption within the “lowest” Ta2O5 layer (ex-
tinction coeﬃcient k = 4kTa2O5, where kTa2O5 is deﬁned
in Sec. IX) are heuristically introduced in the model in
order to describe the measured Q-factors. This ﬁt is very
convincing (Fig. 8). This description of the top dielectric-
mirror DBR-I is used to interpret the measurements on
microcavities formed using the semiconductor-DBRs as
bottom mirror (Fig. 3(b),(c) and Fig. 5(b)).
IX.
1D TRANSFER MATRIX CALCULATION OF THE
MICROCAVITY Q-FACTORS
We list the relevant parameters used for the Q-
factor calculations via a one-dimensional transfer-matrix
method.
Extinction coeﬃcients in the diﬀerent materials are in-
troduced as follows. For DBR-I, kSiO2 = 4·10−7 for SiO2
(Ref.39), kTa2O5 = 4.5 · 10−7 for Ta2O5 (Ref.39), and
k = 4kTa2O5 is used for the “lowest”, i.e. the last-grown,
Ta2O5 layer (the layer closest to the vacuum-gap). For
DBR-II, kSiO2 = 4 · 10−6 for SiO2, kTa2O5 = 4.5 · 10−6
for Ta2O5 (from ﬁtting data taken with curved DBR-II
and planar DBR-I microcavity). Finally, for the semi-
conductor nip-DBR, kp++ = 5.2 · 10−4 for p++-GaAs,
kp+ = 1.9 · 10−4 for p+-GaAs, and kn+ = 0.7 · 10−4 for
n+-GaAs13. An extinction coeﬃcient of k = αFKλ/(4π),
where αFK is a F-K absorption coeﬃcient, is introduced
in the capping layer; αFK depends on the electric ﬁeld.
Surface roughness is described by introducing an addi-
tional layer of thickness d = 2σ, where σ is the rms sur-
face/interface roughness31.
In analogy to the experiment, a Q-factor is determined
for a ﬁxed “vacuum-gap” layer thickness by calculating
a cavity transmittance spectrum.

power at the cavity resonance to the laser power before the ob-
jective lens multiplied by a ﬁtted in-coupling eﬃciency of 59%.
The black solid (red dashed) line is a calculation of the Q-
factor (cavity transmittance) taking into account a material
extinction coeﬃcient of kSiO2 = 4·10−7 and kTa2O5 = 4.5·10−7
for SiO2 and Ta2O5, respectively39. Additionally, an interface
roughness of σ = 0.25 nm above each of the ﬁve last grown
Ta2O5 layers and k = 4kTa2O5 in the last-grown Ta2O5 layer
are introduced heuristically in order to ﬁt the experimental
data.
the calculated spectrum is used to determine the reso-
nance frequency as well as the Q-factor. This procedure
is repeated for diﬀerent vacuum-gaps, yielding a plot of
Q-factor versus wavelength. The resulting Q-factors are
presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 8.
X.
CONCLUSION
Signiﬁcant surface-related losses in an open microcav-
ity consisting of an nip-DBR and dielectric DBR are
much reduced by passivating the GaAs surface.
The
passivation works primarily by eliminating the Franz-
Keldysh-like absorption in the capping layer. Secondary
beneﬁt of the passivation is to reduce loss by surface scat-
tering. With passivation, Q-factors close to 106 can be
achieved.

30Note that the measured Q-factors obtained with an electrically-
contacted passivated sample and with an electrically-uncontacted
passivated sample were similar. The latter are not shown in
Fig. 3(b).

37In order to estimate the capping ﬁelds in Ref.36, we assume mid-
gap pinning, dividing half the bandgap Eg/2 = 0.71 eV of GaAs
at 300 K by the capping layer thicknesses there reported.
38We note that reﬂectance spectra (Fig. 2(a)) on diﬀerent samples
with nominally the same dielectric coating exhibited up to 6 nm11
shifts in wavelength, most probably due to thickness variations
across the wafer.
